'You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you have finished.'\n    Fact 1.2: Creativity and experimentation in art are central to both the patients' activities and the work typical of an artists' collective.\n        Quote 1.2: Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit of clay and slapped it into place.\nConclusion: Thus, an artists' collective shares the most similarities with the group of patients in the mental institution as described by the author.",
