It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\nThe gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\nGirard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\nour\\nminds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\ncon\\nyou out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\nTo start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\nAt the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nZo-ro-as-ter\\n,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\nevery\\npore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAcademician\\nGubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\nDoc\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\nShe looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The hot, throbbing rumble\\n whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\\n the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\\n chance! Swiftly O\\'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\\n throbbing rumble changed tone.\\n\\n\\n Old Callahan\\'s voice crackled now through the helmet\\'s ear contact.\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\\n Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn\\'t you lock them controls before\\n blast-off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"If every control hadn\\'t been locked in correct setting,\" O\\'Rielly\\n answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\\n registered before blast-off—wouldn\\'t it, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know yet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n The icy knot in O\\'Rielly\\'s stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\\n this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O\\'Rielly\\'s? In a\\n hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O\\'Rielly\\n in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\\n had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\\n Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\\n thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\\n aboard gone in a churning cloud.\\n\\n\\n Sweat pouring off him, O\\'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\\n the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn\\'t any\\n more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\\n room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\\n and a meter registered beside the Burnerman\\'s bunk and on the Burner\\n Chief\\'s console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\\n officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O\\'Rielly had been in Four\\'s watch\\n room. Nobody had passed through. O\\'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\\n By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\\n inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\\n\\n\\n Well, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\\n mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O\\'Rielly\\n saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\\n some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\\n his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\\n that way.\\n\\n\\n She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\\n either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\\n O\\'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\\n of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy\\'s most secret dreams. \"I\\n couldn\\'t stand the heat any longer and I couldn\\'t open that big door.\\n So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\\n naturally you couldn\\'t hear me walk out while your back was turned\\n resetting the control.\"\\nO\\'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\\n until she couldn\\'t sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\\n where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\\n breath against woman\\'s supremacy in all matters. That male character\\n trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\\n O\\'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one\\'s person, heard\\n himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\\n that bother to get out here!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so kind. But I\\'m afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I\\'ll drop a\\n suggestion in the Old Woman\\'s box first chance I get.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\\n that O\\'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\\n her.\\n\\n\\n Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\\n in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\\n when he\\'d been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\\n had a jug to cheer one\\'s parting with one\\'s money.\\n\\n\\n A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\\n flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\\n buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\\n\\n\\n When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\\n what about that control?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What control?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, that little thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O\\'Rielly\\n sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\\n Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\\n again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly said while bowing\\n gracefully.\\n\\n\\n \"Higher than a swacked skunk\\'s tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\\n snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\\n Burner Chief Terrence Callahan\\'s mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody\\'s,\\n would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O\\'Rielly\\'s shower now.\\n Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\\n Oh, very quite!\\n\\n\\n \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn\\'t I tell you\\n to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman\\'s taking a Venus bigwig\\n on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\\n she\\'ll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she\\'ll do anyway\\n about your fusion control!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\\n been thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\\n myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O\\'Rielly\\'s shower\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"Venus dames,\" O\\'Rielly said dreamily, \"don\\'t boss anything, do they?\"\\n\\n\\n Callahan yelped like he\\'d been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\\n \"O\\'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\\n Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\\n position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\\n have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan\\'s eyes rolled like the\\n devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O\\'Rielly, open your big ears\\n whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\\n\\n\\n \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\\n got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\\n everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\\n it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\\n the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\\n family—everything.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, that\\'s when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\\n with knots in their tails. Before the guys who\\'d brought the Venus\\n dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\\n pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\\n back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\\n Earth again there wouldn\\'t be enough left of Venus to find with an\\n electron microscope.\\n\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\\n notions, right away there wouldn\\'t be enough Earth left to hide in an\\n atom\\'s eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\\n Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\\n light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\\n deal.\\n\\n\\n \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\\n stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\\n Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\\n around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\\n at bargain basement prices.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O\\'Rielly said, still\\n dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pray heaven you\\'ll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\\n foot of you! Even though you\\'d know she\\'d be your damnation wouldn\\'t\\n make a whit difference—you\\'d still act sappier than thirty-seven\\n angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O\\'Rielly. \"Holy\\n hollering saints!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded with an airy\\n laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\\n lived to tell it, has he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\\n into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O\\'Rielly snorted.\\n \"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\\n \"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain\\'t you? Some big enough to\\n stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig\\'s bags,\\n even through customs? Just run \\'em through the big Geiger that tells\\n whether there\\'s any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself\\n one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig\\'s pile of\\n \\'em.\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when\\n a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.\\n Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his\\n ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.\\n Wasn\\'t like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\\n\\n\\n With suddenly enlivened interest O\\'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how\\n come you know so much?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\\n to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I\\'d had\\n a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\\n Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O\\'Rielly\\'s head. \"Look! I was\\n a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\\n twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\\n you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\\n put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain\\'t high\\n on vino and ain\\'t been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\\n feed the Old Woman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly responded cheerfully.\\n\\n\\n \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\\n Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\\n least!\"\\n\\n\\n Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\\n Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\\n was saved! And O\\'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\\n lovely neck and his own forever.\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower door, however, opened abruptly. O\\'Rielly had not\\n opened it. O\\'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\\n his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn\\'t she\\n have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\\n\\n\\n At sight of her, of course, Callahan\\'s eyes near popped from his old\\n head. \"Berta!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I\\'m Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma\\'s\\n name is Berta and people say I\\'m just like she was a hundred and\\n twenty-five years ago.\"\\n\"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\\n was being slapped together again. \"O\\'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\\n pirate, couldn\\'t you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\\n you don\\'t have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\\n don\\'t flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\\n a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower.\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\\n Trillium. Just like that, O\\'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\\n spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\\n the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\\n and coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\\n\\n\\n \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\\n Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\\n\\n\\n Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\\n ship. O\\'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don\\'t you\\n worry about another thing!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I\\'m not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\\n way Grandmamma knew it would!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\\n bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\\n don\\'t tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\\n to know.\\n\\n\\n The watch room\\'s door had opened. Wouldn\\'t think the Old Woman was a\\n day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\\n probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\\n Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\\n looked at O\\'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\\n\\n\\n Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\\n\\n\\n Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\\n erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\\n robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\\n lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\\n from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\\n of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\\n\\n\\n She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\\n you a question, did I not?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Believe you did, ma\\'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\\n answer is, ma\\'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly and me was\\n discussing—ah—matrimony, ma\\'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly\\n here is considering it, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\\n Wasn\\'t too bad a fib. The more O\\'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\\n ideas he got of doing things he\\'d never dreamt of before in his life.\\n Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman\\'s look was fit to\\n freeze O\\'Rielly\\'s brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\\n down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, you\\'ll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma\\'am!\"\\n Callahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\\n women—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\\n the control phenomenon, ma\\'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\\n Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\\n said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed \\'twouldn\\'t\\n bother me none if there wasn\\'t one of the things left in the world!\\n Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\\n courtly bow.\\n\\n\\n \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan\\'s face,\\n then in O\\'Rielly\\'s vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\\n she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\\n horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\\n again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don\\'t you know what your shower is for?\\n Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\\n burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\\n me, Your Excellency?\"\\n\\n\\n \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O\\'Rielly and Callahan much as\\n he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\\n ever told any Venus man what to do.\\n\\n\\n The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\\n steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\\n blowing her gaskets completely, O\\'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\\n door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\\n of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\\n Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\\n sweat.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\\n first, Your Excellency.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\\n \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\\n\\n\\n No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\\n Woman, a prime symbol of her gender\\'s superiority, whipped a razor edge\\n onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain\\'s quarters are more\\n satisfactory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\\nSeeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s watch room. Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from busting\\n out laughing for joy.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\\n betwixt O\\'Rielly\\'s grand brain and Callahan\\'s great experience she\\'d be\\n happy forever.\\n\\n\\n A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\\n yanked open the doors under O\\'Rielly\\'s bunk.\\n\\n\\n \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\\n course.\\n\\n\\n \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\\n sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Trillium,\" O\\'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\\n keep coming out of hiding just when nobody\\'s going to find you?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O\\'Rielly would have gladly\\n drowned himself if he could.\\n\"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\\n outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman\\'s company, and for\\n her leaving her planet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up!\" His Excellency\\'s ear beards were standing straight out\\n sideways. \"I\\'ll handle this!\"\\n\\n\\n \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\\n Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\\n\\n\\n \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\\n back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\\n of Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\\n at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\\n O\\'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\\n looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium\\'s brave loveliness and\\n protect it to his last breath of life.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\\n Panels on opposite walls lit up.\\n\\n\\n \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\\n \"Interplanetary emergency.\"\\n\\n\\n Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\\n pleasant.\\n\\n\\n \"Madame President\\'s office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. President\\'s office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\\n efforts.\"\\n\\n\\n Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\\n Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\\n\\n\\n The flunkies\\' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\\n blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\\n\\n\\n Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\\n facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\\n\\n\\n The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\\n that were as fierce as an eagle\\'s, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\\n own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\\n Excellency, \"what\\'s this nonsense?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\\n annoyance.\\n\\n\\n \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\\n \"Some silly female cackling now!\"\\n\\n\\n The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one\\'s left hand on a\\n desk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\\n\\n\\n \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\\n\\n\\n \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\\n those two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\\n myself, and Mr. O\\'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President\\'s ear beards stood near straight up\\n as he roared, \"You couldn\\'t have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\\n tell the truth!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\\n\"Obviously Trillium\\'s poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\\n Excellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn\\'t know the first\\n thing about such things!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I\\'ve been married to her\\n for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she\\'s the finest\\n rattle-brain I ever knew!\"\\n\\n\\n \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\\n years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\\n volcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....\\n Berta? Impossible!\"\\n\\n\\n Madame President\\'s shapely finger now rested full on the button that\\n could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a\\n thousand years. \"I\\'m afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame\\n President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter\\'s actions have every mark\\n of an invasion tactic by your government.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President\\'s finger now lay\\n poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow\\n Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under\\n your official command! Weren\\'t you, Trillium dear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring\\n our cause to the attention of Earth\\'s President. If Earth will only\\n stop buying from Venus, you won\\'t have any money to squander on your\\n wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what\\'s wrong with my wars? People\\n have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody\\n around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But\\n nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they\\n haven\\'t time for us women. That\\'s why we always radiated such a fatal\\n attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home\\n doing useful work!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten\\n months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\"\\n\\n\\n \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and\\n be lonely!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all\\n Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That\\'s the way things have been on\\n Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can\\'t\\n change it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these\\n conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating\\n all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" Grandpapa\\'s beards near pulled his ears off. \"It\\'s not legal!\\n You can\\'t get away with this!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to\\n Trillium\\'s advised from the Venus panel.\\n\\n\\n Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta! What are you doing\\n here? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Were.\" Features more beautifully mature than Trillium\\'s crowded onto\\n the panel too. \"From now on I\\'m doing the deciding.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense! You\\'re only my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody\\'s turning this planet into\\n another Earth where a man can\\'t even sneeze unless some woman says so!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take him away, girls,\" Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse was\\n yanked from view.\\n\\n\\n His bellows, however, could be heard yet. \"Unhand me, you fool\\n creatures! Guards! Guards!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you\\'re in the cooler,\\n enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are in\\n control everywhere now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dimmy,\" Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, \"you have beat\\n around the bush with me long enough. Now say it!\"\\nDimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\\n Earthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\\n then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\\n enough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\\n love only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\\n works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\\n Venus women had our own men in our power.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\\n enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth\\'s\\n tranquility.\"\\n\\n\\n Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\\n Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\\n away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\\n from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\\n headache in history.\\n\\n\\n \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\\n perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\\n conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\\n President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\\n\\n\\n \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\\n receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\\n convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\\n moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\\n communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\\n broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\\n top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\\n over Dimmy\\'s credentials.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\\n graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\\n Mr. O\\'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\\n revolution better than they knew.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\\n doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\\n best.\"\\n\\n\\n The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\\n Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O\\'Rielly and Callahan.\\n Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\\n old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\\n before returning to your stations.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, well,\" O\\'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\\n earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\\n Saturn? Lucky we ain\\'t programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\\n crows for breakfast.\" Callahan\\'s old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\\n grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\\n\\n\\n \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O\\'Rielly\\n said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\\n did Trillium\\'s Grandmamma let him go?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Venus guys wasn\\'t so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\\n like to himself, \"they\\'d of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\\n guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\\n Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won\\'t be one\\n much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\\n but didn\\'t, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\\n to take over Venus, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\\n before her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did \\'our boy\\' leave\\n Grandmamma?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\\'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn\\'t heard a word O\\'Rielly\\n said, \"you could sweet-talk \\'em, kiss \\'em and hold \\'em tighter\\'n\\n Billy-be-damned. And that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not sure,\" O\\'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, \\'that\\'s all.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\\n Course not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ain\\'t nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma\\'am.\\n Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tickles \\'em, boy, tickles \\'em!\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

It made a one-night\\n\\n pitch on a Venusian swamp-town—to\\n\\n find that death stalked it from the\\n\\n jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories May 1943.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nBucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He\\n knocked over the pitcher of\\nthil\\n, but it didn\\'t matter. The pitcher\\n was empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\\n very hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\\n spring them.\\n\\n\\n \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\\n down the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You\\'re kidding!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\\n a curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\\n I\\'m kidding! With Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\\n Space, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he\\'d been a\\n lot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\\n I\\'ve wet-nursed Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\\n eleven years, and I know. It\\'s lousy, it\\'s mangy, it\\'s broken-down!\\n Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\\n\\n\\n I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\\n Buckhalter Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon\\'s face\\n unless he\\'s tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\\n\\n\\n Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\\n grey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\\n girl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\\n slanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\\n toward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\\n\\n\\n I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\\n Shannon\\'s one-seventy-five, and how I\\'m not as young as I used to be.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\\n\\n\\n Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\\n Shannon?\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\\n pleasantly and said, very gently:\\n\\n\\n \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\\n\\n\\n I shot a glance at the newcomer. He\\'d saved me from a beating, even if\\n he was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\\n settled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\\n\\n\\n The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\\n in dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\\n grey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\\n clean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\\n with their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\\n\\n\\n There didn\\'t seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\\n blue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky\\'s.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"I don\\'t think you understand.\"\\n\\n\\n I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\\n back. It sounded like he\\'d ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\\n got my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\\n and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\\n\\n\\n Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\\n\\n\\n I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\\n It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\\n quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\\n\\n\\n Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What\\'s eating you,\\n Jig? I\\'m not going to hurt him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he\\'s got there. Money!\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy looked at me. He hadn\\'t turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\\n \"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I\\'m\\n Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\\n the table. \"I\\'m sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\\n stayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\\n that it wasn\\'t transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\\n ever met, and you couldn\\'t see into those innocent blue eyes any more\\n than you could see through sheet metal.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t like him. I didn\\'t like him at all. But he had money. I said,\\n \"Howdy. Let\\'s go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\\n like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\\n Beamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.\"\\nI looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn\\'t\\n say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\\n pitcher of\\nthil\\non the table. Then I cleared my throat.\\n\\n\\n \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\\n\\n\\n Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\\n independent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\\n the burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\\n started to get up. I kicked him under the table.\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\\n\\n\\n He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\\n ignored him. He went on, quietly,\\n\\n\\n \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\\n valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\\n toil and boredom....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\\n entertainment of the—\\nproper\\nsort has been available. I propose to\\n remedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\\n a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\\n speak, and I kicked him again.\\n\\n\\n \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We\\'d have to cancel\\n several engagements....\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\\n\\n\\n \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\\n\\n\\n The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\\n glared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\\n\\n\\n It was Gow, our zoo-man—a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\\n colony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\\n scenery—scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\\n curtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\\n than the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Boss, Gertrude\\'s actin\\' up again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can\\'t you see I\\'m busy?\"\\n\\n\\n Gow\\'s black eyes were unpleasant. \"I\\'m tellin\\' you, Boss, Gertrude\\n ain\\'t happy. She ain\\'t had the right food. If something....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"That\\'ll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn\\'t take much timber to\\n fit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude\\'s unhappy. She\\'s lonesome,\\n see? And if she don\\'t get happier pretty soon I ain\\'t sure your tin-pot\\n ship\\'ll hold her.\"\\n\\n\\n He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\\n cleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\\n\\n\\n \"Gertrude?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah. She\\'s kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\\n finished for him.\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\\n Venusian\\ncansin\\n. The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\\n Brothers, and she\\'s much smaller than Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\\n She was also much younger, but I didn\\'t go into that. Gertrude may be\\n a little creaky, but she\\'s still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\\n wouldn\\'t die on us, because without her we\\'d have a sicker-looking\\n circus than even I could stand.\\n\\n\\n Beamish looked impressed. \"A\\ncansin\\n. Well, well! The mystery\\n surrounding the origin and species of the\\ncansin\\nis a fascinating\\n subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\\n\\n\\n We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We\\'d have to have\\n at least a hundred U.C.\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\\n Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\\n second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\\n stomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\\n agreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\\n off half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\\n\\n\\n \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\\n the morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\\n\\n\\n We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\\n grab for the money, but I beat him to it.\\n\\n\\n \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\\n Here.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I\\'d been holding out. \"We\\n can get lushed enough on this.\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\\n he said suddenly,\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It may be crooked.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete\\'s sake!\" I\\n yelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\\n where the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there\\'ll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\\n poked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\\nthildatum\\n!\"\\nIt was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where\\n Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late\\n as it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting\\n around and smoking and looking very ugly.\\n\\n\\n It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless\\n under the two moons. There\\'s a smell to Mars, like something dead and\\n dried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown\\n red dust gritted in my teeth.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to\\n the roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his\\n feet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\\n\\n\\n They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I\\n grinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more\\n than money. It grates on a man\\'s pride to have to sneak in and out of\\n his own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in\\n weeks we\\'d come in at the front door.\\n\\n\\n I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,\\n Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.\\n Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\\n\\n\\n \"Now?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Now,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join\\n in. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went\\n home happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\\n\\n\\n The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the\\n green girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the\\n muscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers\\n and joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the\\n passageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\\n \"They\\'re good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I\\'ve\\n rewarded them.\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go see Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going\\n into the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I\\'m a city\\n guy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But\\n Bucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a pal, Jif. Bes\\' li\\'l\\' guy inna worl\\'....\"\\n\\n\\n The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he\\'d fall down\\n the ladder and break his neck. That\\'s why I went along. If I hadn\\'t....\\n Oh, well, what\\'s a few nightmares among friends?\\n\\n\\n It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was\\n a dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude\\'s hand. We started down\\n the long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and\\n compression units.\\n\\n\\n Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn\\'t\\n near as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It\\'s\\n the smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,\\n breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled\\n around them as strong as the cage bars.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and\\n then wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.\\n A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,\\n ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\\n\\n\\n It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same\\n time. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I\\n could think of, and I couldn\\'t hear myself doing it. Presently a great\\n metallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow\\n had them nicely conditioned to that gong.\\nBut they didn\\'t quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel\\n them inside you when they\\'re uneasy. I think that\\'s why I\\'m scared of\\n them. They make me feel like I\\'m not human as I thought—like I wanted\\n to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,\\n all of a sudden....\\n\\n\\n Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She\\'s gettin\\'\\n worse,\" he said. \"She\\'s lonesome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an\\n owl\\'s. He swayed slightly. \"That\\'s sure tough.\" He sniffled.\\n\\n\\n I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank\\n and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a\\n deep breath. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever seen a\\ncansin\\n. There\\'s only\\n two of them on the Triangle. If you haven\\'t, nothing I can say will\\n make much difference.\\n\\n\\n They\\'re what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old\\n Dame Nature had an idea that didn\\'t jell. The\\ncansins\\nwere pretty\\n successful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and\\n now there\\'s only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even\\n the Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\\n\\n\\n I wouldn\\'t know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck\\n some place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little\\n bird blood thrown in. Anyway, she\\'s big.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage\\n with her hands—yeah, hands—hanging over her knees and her snaky head\\n sunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.\\n Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\\n\\n\\n The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the\\n mane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes\\n clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like\\n old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\\n\\n\\n Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow!\\n Nobody\\'s ever seen a male\\ncansin\\n. There may not even be any.\"\\n\\n\\n Gertrude screamed again. She didn\\'t move, not even to raise her head.\\n The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That\\n close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold\\n inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You\\'ll have to snap her out of\\n this, Gow. She\\'s driving the rest of \\'em nuts.\"\\n\\n\\n He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood\\n looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he\\n turned to Gertrude.\\n\\n\\n \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak\\'s wreck\\n and everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know\\n her. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a\\n woman\\'s talking about a sick child.\\n\\n\\n \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain\\'t sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well for Pete\\'s sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need\\n her.\" I took Shannon\\'s arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn\\'t look at\\n us. Bucky sobbed.\\n\\n\\n \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But\\n it\\'s all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan\\' me? Like Gow there with\\n Gertrude. She\\'s ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\\n\\n\\n We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed\\n high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all\\n around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\\n\\n\\n Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist\\n rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly\\n with blue, cold fire.\\n\\n\\n I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God\\'s sake!\"\\n\\n\\n I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp\\n and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and\\n roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all\\n I could hear Gertrude\\'s lonely, whistling scream.\\n\\n\\n I thought, \"\\nSomebody\\'s down here. Somebody let \\'em out. Somebody wants\\n to kill us!\\n\" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I\\n sobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\\n\\n\\n One of Bucky\\'s dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I\\n rolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the\\n hollow of his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the\\n back of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my\\n mouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\\n\\n\\n Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\\n \"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I\\'m scared!\"\\n\\n\\n Then I went out.\\nII\\n\\n\\n Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His\\n little brown face was crinkled with laughter. He\\'d lost most of his\\n teeth, and he gummed\\nthak\\n-weed. It smelt.\\n\\n\\n \"You pretty, Mis\\' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\\n\\n\\n He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and\\n said, \"Where\\'s Shannon? How is he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mis\\' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis\\' Jig. Mis\\' Gow come\\n nickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down\\n a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the\\n washstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned\\n snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch\\n plaid. I felt sick.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was\\n a big burn across his neck. He said:\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\\n\\n\\n I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\\n\\n\\n Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in.\\n Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\\n\\n\\n I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far.\\n Nobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish. He realizes he\\'s been gypped.\"\\n\\n\\n \"One hundred U.C.\\'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge\\n mining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\\n\\n\\n I shrugged. \"You\\'re the boss man. I\\'m only the guy that beats off the\\n creditors.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn\\'t a\\n comfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let\\'s go sign.\" He put his hand on the\\n latch and looked at my feet. \"And—uh—Jig, I....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don\\'t trip me up, that\\'s all!\"\\n\\n\\n We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,\\n and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking\\n like a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian\\n strong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had\\n kittens.\\n\\n\\n Nobody would have minded that, only one of \\'em had only four legs. It\\n lived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out\\n of their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\\n\\n\\n Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.\\n Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It\\n didn\\'t help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at\\n dinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I\\n was ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\\n\\n\\n Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our\\n itinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It\\n was Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a\\n bunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle\\n of it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\\n\\n\\n I saw Beamish\\'s sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and\\n our router\\'s runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\\n\\n\\n \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\\n\\n\\n I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and\\n went out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they\\n weren\\'t happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus\\n heat was already sneaking into the ship.\\n\\n\\n While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,\\n screaming.\\nThe canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in\\n the mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I\\n stood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\\n\\n\\n I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was\\n standing in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her\\n triangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn\\'t have anything on\\n but her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn\\'t\\n sound nice.\\n\\n\\n You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with\\n the electric power they carry in their own bodies. They\\'re Venusian\\n middle-swampers, they\\'re not human, and they never forget it.\\n\\n\\n Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with\\n white reptilian teeth.\\n\\n\\n \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can\\n smell it in the swamp wind.\"\\n\\n\\n The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under\\n her jaw pulsed like a toad\\'s, and her eyes were red.\\n\\n\\n \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken.\\n They are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\\n\\n\\n She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight\\n and cold. Bucky said,\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\\n\\n\\n We weren\\'t half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing\\n field when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We\\n could see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\\n\\n\\n He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or\\n four tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\\n\\n\\n Bucky said, \"Jig—it\\'s Sam Kapper.\"\\n\\n\\n We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled\\n around to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man\\n who crawled and whimpered in the mud.\\n\\n\\n Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and\\n carnivals. He\\'d given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren\\'t\\n too broke, and we were pretty friendly.\\n\\n\\n I hadn\\'t seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed,\\n hard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick,\\n looking down at him.\\n\\n\\n Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over\\n like animals I\\'ve seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over\\n and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\\n\\n\\n I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn\\'t pay much attention. I\\n only caught a glimpse of the man\\'s face as he straightened up. I didn\\'t\\n realize until later that he looked familiar.\\n\\n\\n We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a\\n couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled\\n the curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the\\n cigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\\n\\n\\n Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What\\'s the trouble?\"\\nKapper tried to straighten up. He hadn\\'t shaved. The lean hard lines\\n of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\\n with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man\\'s.\\n\\n\\n He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I\\'d do it, and I did. I found it\\n and brought it out.\"\\n\\n\\n The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn\\'t notice it. \"Help\\n me,\" he said simply. \"I\\'m scared.\" His mouth drooled.\\n\\n\\n \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won\\'t tell \\'em. It\\'s\\n got to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\\n wouldn\\'t let me, and I was afraid they\\'d find it....\"\\n\\n\\n He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don\\'t know\\n how they found out about it, but they did. I\\'ve got to get it back.\\n I\\'ve got to....\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\\n suddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky got up. \"I\\'ll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\\n grabbed his wrist. Kapper\\'s nails were blue and the cords in his hands\\n stood out like guy wires.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t leave me. Got to tell you—where it is. Got to take it back.\\n Promise you\\'ll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\\n breathing.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n Kapper\\'s face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\\n air. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\\n use. Kapper whispered,\\n\\n\\n \"\\nCansin\\n. Male. Only one. You don\\'t know...! Take him back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where is it, Sam?\"\\n\\n\\n I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\\n was standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\\n made a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\\n\\n\\n Beamish never changed expression. He didn\\'t move while Bucky felt\\n Kapper\\'s pulse. Bucky didn\\'t need to say anything. We knew.\\n\\n\\n \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\\n Beamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\\n pushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\\n\\n\\n \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\\n told him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\\n over to the bar.\\n\\n\\n I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\\n place. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch\\n of miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\\n\\n\\n Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\\n did any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\\n\\n\\n The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\\n was a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\\n coiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\\n\\n\\n I leaned on the bar. \"\\nLhak\\n,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\\n green bottle. I reached for it, casually.\\n\\n\\n \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\\n cold. What\\'s he been spiking his drinks with?\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSelak\\n,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\\n behind me. And I remembered him, then.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Flowers,\\n\\n had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\\n\\n hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\\n\\n And the danger from the villain of the piece\\n\\n didn\\'t worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nI was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\\nSpacemen\\'s Club\\nin Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\\n shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\\n thee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\\n\\n\\n A woman here...! The\\nSpacemen\\'s\\nwas a sanctuary, a rest club where\\n in-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\\n voyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\\n enforced.\\n\\n\\n I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\\n lounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie!\\n\\n\\n There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\\n on her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\\n voluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\\n tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\\n planted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\\n calm defiance.\\n\\n\\n I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\\n haven\\'t seen you in two years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\\n fish-face to shut up.\"\\n\\n\\n The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\\n friend of yourth, you\\'ll have to take her away. It\\'th abtholutely\\n againth the ruleth....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we\\'ll go into the grille. There\\'s no\\n one there at this hour.\"\\n\\n\\n In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey\\n and Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed\\n the drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\\n\\n\\n \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don\\'t you know women aren\\'t\\n allowed in the\\nSpacemen\\'s\\n? What happened to the book you were\\n writing?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\\n this place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that\\'s what\\n they are. Anyway, I\\'ve been thrown out of better places.\"\\n\\n\\n She hadn\\'t changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\\n Annabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\\n But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year\\'s\\n hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\\n in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\\n\\n\\n But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\\n more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\\n sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\\n\\n\\n One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\\n novels, but they weren\\'t synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\\n novel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\\n and hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\\n expeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\\n\\n\\n She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\\n\\n\\n \"What happened to\\nGuns for Ganymede\\n?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\\n your last, wasn\\'t it?\"\\nGrannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\\n rolled herself a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \"It wasn\\'t\\nGuns\\n, it was\\nPistols\\n; and it wasn\\'t\\nGanymede\\n, it was\\nPluto\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n I grinned. \"All complete, I\\'ll bet, with threats against the universe\\n and beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can\\'t have\\n your hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\\n\\n\\n Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\\n feet.\\n\\n\\n \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I\\'m due at the\\nSatellite\\nTheater in ten\\n minutes. Come on, you\\'re going with me.\"\\n\\n\\n Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\\n the jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\\n drew up before the big doors of the\\nSatellite\\n.\\n\\n\\n They don\\'t go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\\n colonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\\n muck,\\nzilcon\\nwood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\\n packed with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity\\n that made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\\n\\n\\n In front was a big sign. It read:\\nONE NIGHT ONLY\\n\\n DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\\n\\n NINE GENIUSES\\n\\n THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\\n\\n THE SYSTEM\\n\\n\\n As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\\n tinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\\n front row.\\n\\n\\n \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I\\'m sorry about all this rush, but I\\'m one of\\n the players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we\\'ll go\\n somewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\\n stage steps and disappeared in the wings.\\n\\n\\n \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She\\'ll be the death of me\\n yet.\"\\n\\n\\n The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\\n stage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\\n sat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\\n Mercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\\n uncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\\n improved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\\n Earthman operator.\\nA tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\\n advanced to the footlights.\\n\\n\\n \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\\n myself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a roar of applause from the\\nSatellite\\naudience. When it had\\n subsided, the man continued:\\n\\n\\n \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\\n to give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\\n nine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\\n sets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\\n These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\\n question missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\\nplanetoles\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\\n her wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\\n science fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\\n\\n\\n From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\\n on the dais.\\n\\n\\n The Doctor\\'s program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\\n dials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\\n coalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\\n voice echoed through the theater:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWho was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\\n hand. She said quietly:\\n\\n\\n \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\\n tracto-car.\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\\n the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\\n cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\\n bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\\n or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\\n the winner.\\n\\n\\n It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\\n brought me here. And then I began to notice things.\\n\\n\\n The audience in the\\nSatellite\\nseemed to have lost much of its\\n original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\\n signal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\\n\\n\\n Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\\n general surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\\n were turned in a smile of satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\\n crowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\\n occurred.\\n\\n\\n A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\\n dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\\n unpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\\n the Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\\n an earlier era.\\n\\n\\n Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\\n man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\\n was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\\n snipped the Martian\\'s single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\\n into his mouth.\\n\\n\\n Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\\n rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\\n shout derisive epithets.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\\n and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\\n THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\\n was all but deserted.\\n\\n\\n In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I\\'ve ever seen. The I.P. men\\n ought to clamp down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The I.P. men aren\\'t strong enough.\"\\n\\n\\n She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\\n line about her usually smiling lips.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\nFor a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\\n closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\\n\\n\\n \"My last book,\\nDeath In The Atom\\n, hit the stands last January,\"\\n she began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months\\'\\n vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\\n Well, I\\'d used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\\n for this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\\n weeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\\n Karn....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who?\" I interrupted.\\n\\n\\n \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\\n Varsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\\n his adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\\n asked abruptly.\\n\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\\n rock once found on Mercury. The\\nAlpha\\nrays of this rock are similar\\n to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\\n projected at high speed. But the character of the\\nGamma\\nrays has\\n never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\\n electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\\nBeta\\nor cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\\n\\n\\n \"When any form of life is exposed to these\\nGamma\\nrays from the Green\\n Flame rock, they produce in the creature\\'s brain a certain lassitude\\n and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\\n develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\\n guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\\n intolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\\n a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\\n\\n\\n I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman\\'s every word.\\n\\n\\n \"Now in 2710, as you\\'d know if you studied your history, the three\\n planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\\n cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\\n enough to endanger all civilized life.\\n\\n\\n \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\\n government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\\n ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\\n immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\\n followed.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\\n old prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\\n travels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\\n an old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\\n Flames!\"\\n\\n\\n If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\\n I said, \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\\n if it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\\n after the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\\n existence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there\\'d be trouble.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, I regarded Karn\\'s story as a wild dream, but it made\\n corking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\\n it was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you\\'ve come to the\\n conclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\\n attempting to put your plot into action.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That\\'s exactly what I think.\"\\n\\n\\n I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\\n and laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who\\'s\\n your thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\\n\\n\\n She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\\n\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n\\n \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\\n quiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\\n happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\\n police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\\n representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\\n dictator to step in.\\n\\n\\n \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\\n single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\\n my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\\n times more potent and is transmiting it\\nen masse\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\\n have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\\n approaching danger.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\\nZinnng-whack!\\n\"All right!\"\\n\\n\\n On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\\n appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie\\'s head the\\n fresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\\n\\n\\n A heat ray!\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\\n door. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\\n woman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\\n threw over the starting stud.\\n\\n\\n An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\\nSix days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\\n outpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\\n the eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\\n water. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\\n sky like puffs of cotton.\\n\\n\\n We had traveled this far by\\nganet\\n, the tough little two headed pack\\n animal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\\n had its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\\n belt that encircled the planet\\'s equator. Now our drivers changed to\\n boatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\\njagua\\ncanoes.\\n\\n\\n It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\\n confidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\\n Ezra Karn so much the better. If we don\\'t, we follow his directions to\\n the lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\\n see, I\\'m positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\\n ship.\"\\n\\n\\n Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\\n tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\\n steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\\n just before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\\n that broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\\n isolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\\n given me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\\n coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\\n representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\\n to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\\n\\n\\n Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\\n tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\\n Grannie\\'s incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\\n which she had skilfully blended into a novel?\\n\\n\\n Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\\n place a ringing silence blanketed everything.\\n\\n\\n And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\\n undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\\n it advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\\n It charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\\n There was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\\n talons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\\n missing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\\n\\n\\n From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\\n appeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\\n\\n\\n \"Stand still!\"\\n\\n\\n The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\\n again. This time the old woman\\'s heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\\n purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\\n air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\\n ground and shot aloft.\\nGrannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\\nI stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\\n\\n\\n \"In heaven\\'s name, what was it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\\n in the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\\n trained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\\n and follows with a relentless purpose.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then that would mean...?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\\n cafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\\n tent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\\n being watched. From now on it\\'s the survival of the fittest.\"\\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\\n resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\\n ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\\n surface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\\n the swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\\n multi-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\\n The Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\\n hand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\\n a matter of seconds.\\n\\n\\n At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\\n of the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\\n jetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\\n\\n\\n He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\\n unkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\\n dressed in\\nvarpa\\ncloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\\n head was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\\n\\n\\n \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\\n Flowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\\n hut.\\n\\n\\n The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\\n type of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\\n civilization entirely.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\\n object of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\\n\\n\\n \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\\n find that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\\n cigarette. \"You know where it is, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\\n Varsoom country, and that isn\\'t exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\\n\\n\\n Karn shook his head. \"They\\'re a form of life that\\'s never been seen by\\n Earthmen. Strictly speaking, they\\'re no more than a form of energy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dangerous?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\\n of myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\\n because I was alone, and they didn\\'t notice me, and Darthier escaped\\n because he made \\'em laugh.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\\n that\\'s manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\\n laugh, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\\n Several mold guns were borrowed from the prospector\\'s supply to arm the\\n Venusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\\n\\n\\n \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain\\'t missed one in months.\\n You gotta wait \\'til I hear it.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\\n flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\\n chair, listening with avid interest.\\n\\n\\n It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\\n heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\\n again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\\n and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\\n screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\\n my thoughts far away.\\nHalf an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\\n were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\\n camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\\n about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\\n despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\\n futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\\n from turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\\n that all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\\n\\n\\n After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\\n steaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\\n advance on foot.\\n\\n\\n It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\\n suddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\\n There it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\\narelium\\nsteel,\\n half buried in the swamp soil.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\\n\\n\\n A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\\n quarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\\n suspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\\n insulators.\\n\\n\\n Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\\n Venusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\\n circle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\\n Moments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\\n\\n\\n A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\\n Mid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\\n\\n\\n \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\\n climb slowly.\\n\\n\\n The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\\n There was no sign of life.\\n\\n\\n \"Somebody\\'s gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\\n\\n\\n Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\\n left side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\\n bare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\\n clarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\\n looked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\\n swing slowly to and fro.\\n\\n\\n Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\\n the lower hold are probably exposed to a\\ntholpane\\nplate and their\\n radiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\\n\\n\\n Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\\n glass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\\n atomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\\n guards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let\\'s see if the\\n Green Flames are more accessible.\"\\n\\n\\n In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\\n the feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\\n vessel\\'s hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\\n Suspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\\n plate.\\n\\n\\n But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\\n\\n\\n Grannie stamped her foot. \"It\\'s maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\\n the crux of the whole matter, and we\\'re powerless to make a single\\n move.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\\n In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\\n timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\\n quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\\n power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\\n swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\\n\\n\\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\\n bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\\n Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\\n from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\\n pseudo-elected and didn\\'t know much about the field of space travel\\n nor the significance of Seymour Pond\\'s retirement. Si didn\\'t bother to\\n remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\\n up at all.\\n\\n\\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\\n before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\\n in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\\n his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\\n\\n\\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\\n back. They hadn\\'t figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\\n through decently. Well, possibly he didn\\'t, given their standards.\\n But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn\\'t have their standards. He\\'d had\\n plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\\n crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\\n three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\\n\\n\\n He\\'d had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\\n Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\\n haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\\n space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\\n boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\\n room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\\n autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\\n find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\\n Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\\n mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\\n beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\\n\\n\\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\\n made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\\n wasn\\'t anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\\n keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\\n was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\\n about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\\nThe gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\\n typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\\n Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\\n who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\\n having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\\n eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\\n Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\\n Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\\n courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\\n the Ultrawelfare State.\\n\\n\\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\\n Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\\n bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\\n the cloddy\\'s patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\\n miserably failed.\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn\\'t call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\\n In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\\n Pond\\'s place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\\n been trained. There aren\\'t two men on North America—there aren\\'t two\\n men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\\n delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\\n us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\\n road to his destiny.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\\n training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At that time there wasn\\'t such a blistering percentage of funkers\\n throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\\n foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\\n lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\\n adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\\n ancestors did?\"\\n\\n\\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\\n and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\\n present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one\\'s\\n way of life in the comfort of one\\'s home than to be confronted with\\n the unpleasantness of facing nature\\'s dangers in more adventurous\\n pastimes.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend\\'s argument, leaned forward to snap\\n rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\\n reality, Lofting. Don\\'t require or expect from Seymour Pond more\\n than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\\n Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\\n security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\\n society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\\n clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\\n of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\\n into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\\n population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\\n dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\\n you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\\n the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\\n trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\\n life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\\n very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\\n He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\\n of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\\n made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\\n drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\\n free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\\n our pleas for a few more trips?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\\nGirard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\\n seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\\n the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\\n man.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"No, he hasn\\'t. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\\n always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\\n actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\\n the least dangerous path. Today we\\'ve reached the point where no one\\n need face danger—ever. There are few who don\\'t take advantage of the\\n fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\\n\\n\\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let\\'s\\n leave this blistering jabber about Pond\\'s motivation and get to the\\n point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\\n take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\\n pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\\n explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\\n increasingly hard to come by—even though in\\nour\\nminds, Hans, we are\\n near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\\n spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\\n hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\\n to the point that we haven\\'t a single pilot, then it might well be\\n that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\\n on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\\n Exploration.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\\n\\n\\n \"So some way we\\'ve got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\\n Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\\n face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\\n justify the means?\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin blinked at him.\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\\n failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven\\'t you ever read\\n of the sailor and his way of life?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\\n do with it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\\n than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\\n tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\\n heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\\n birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\\n sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\\n for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\\n of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\\n one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\\n heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\\n would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\\n jail. So back to sea he\\'d have to go.\"\\n\\n\\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\\n can\\'t be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I\\'d\\n personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\\n the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\\n\\n\\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\\n universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\\n \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\\n nobody can, ah,\\ncon\\nyou out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\\n our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\\n\\n\\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\\n methods, my dear chap.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\\n excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\\n of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn\\'t\\n been a chance in a hundred that he\\'d have the bad luck to have his\\n name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\\n\\n\\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\\n were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\\n the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\\n for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\\n taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\\n the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\\n had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\\n take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\\n\\n\\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\\n a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\\n dangers met and passed.\\n\\n\\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\\n him from ever being called up for contributing to the country\\'s labor\\n needs again. And he most certainly wasn\\'t going to volunteer.\\n\\n\\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn\\'t\\n any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn\\'t want to get the\\n reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\\n fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\\n not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn\\'t you? What else did\\n you need?\\n\\n\\n It had come as a surprise when he\\'d been drafted for the labor force.\\n\\n\\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\\n in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\\n They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\\n working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\\n It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\\n but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\\n became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\\n thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\\n to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\\n of them ever really becoming efficient.\\n\\n\\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\\n unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\\n unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\\n reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\\n and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\\n were needed, a draft lottery was held.\\n\\n\\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\\n were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\\n might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\\n granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\\n they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\\n dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\\n sold for a lump sum on the market.\\n\\n\\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\\n vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\\n of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\\n obviously called for.\\n\\n\\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He\\'d\\n accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\\n to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\\n was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\\n wasn\\'t going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\\n\\n\\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\\n fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\\n rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you\\'d been in the\\n classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\\n all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\\n\\n\\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\\n centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\\n the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage\\'s\\n profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\\n quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\\n must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\\n usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\\n hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\\n denied him.\\n\\n\\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\\n\\n\\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\\n works. But nothing but the best.\\nTo start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable\\n retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he\\n attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.\\n A bit of prestige didn\\'t hurt you when you went out on the town. In\\n the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever\\n performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren\\'t\\n needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\\n titles.\\n\\n\\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\\n card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\\n auto-apartment\\'s teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\\n screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\\n\\n\\n In a moment, the teevee-phone\\'s robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\\n Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\\n thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\n apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\\n screen went dead.\\n\\n\\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\\n spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\\n would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\\n wouldn\\'t have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\\n was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\\n\\n\\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\\n two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\\n the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\\n place really made sense. The big city.\\n\\n\\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\\n and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\\n might as well do it up brown.\\n\\n\\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\\n car\\'s dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\\n controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\\n destination, he dialed the vehicle\\'s teevee-phone for information on\\n the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\\n he\\'d read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\\n gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car\\'s destination dial.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\\n\\n\\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\\n shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\\n refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\\n direction of the pressure was reversed.\\n\\n\\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\\n sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\\n canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\\n\\n\\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\\n your credit card within ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\\n swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\\n the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\\n the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\\n Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\\n the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\\n table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\\n he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn\\'t plan to dine\\n or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\\n managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\\n\\n\\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\\n himself happily onto the bed. It wasn\\'t up to the degree of softness\\n he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\\n direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\\n mattress.\\n\\n\\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\\n fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\\n against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\\n registration could be completed.\\n\\n\\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\\n easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\\n around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\\n This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\\n the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\\n\\n\\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\\n at the hotel\\'s famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\\n dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\\n \"Kudos Room.\"\\n\\n\\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\\nAt the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\\n moment and looked about. He\\'d never been in a place like this, either.\\n However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\\n going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\\n his way to the bar.\\n\\n\\n There was actually a bartender.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\\n air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\\n they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\\n He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\\n drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\\n as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\\n\\n\\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he\\'d\\n dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\\n conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\\n to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\\n take a look at the others present.\\n\\n\\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\\n that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\\n Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\\n\\n\\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\\n who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\\n and then swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nZo-ro-as-ter\\n,\" he breathed.\\n\\n\\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\\n having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\\n eyes. Every pore, but\\nevery\\npore, was in place. She sat with the easy\\n grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\\n\\n\\n His stare couldn\\'t be ignored.\\n\\n\\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\\n Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\\n Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\\n\\n\\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\\n building the drink.\\n\\n\\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\\n on me?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\\n Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\\n\\n\\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn\\'t that a\\n space pin?\"\\n\\n\\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good Heavens, you\\'re a spaceman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can\\'t wear one unless you\\n been on at least a Moon run.\"\\n\\n\\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\\n \"you\\'re Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\\n Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\\n\\n\\n She said, \"I\\'m Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\\n Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he\\'d never seen anything\\n like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\\n current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\\n \"I been called Si so long, I don\\'t even know who somebody\\'s talking to\\n if they say Seymour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\\n such that it was obvious she hadn\\'t quite adjusted as yet to having\\n met him.\\n\\n\\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\\n bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\\n him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAcademician\\nGubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\\nDoc\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don\\'t have\\n much time for formality. Everybody\\'s just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\\n that. But how come you cried?\"\\nShe looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\\n as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\\n Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\\n your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\\n planets....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"... and he said all those things about man\\'s conquest of space. And\\n the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\\n that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\\n world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\\n\\n\\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That\\'s all part of the Doc\\'s scheme to get me to\\n take on another three runs. They\\'re afraid the whole department\\'ll be\\n dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\\n Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\\n it\\'d take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\\n So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they\\'re both trying to\\n pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\\n Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\\n ships. It\\'s kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\\n spaceships costs?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don\\'t think it\\'s funny at all.\"\\n\\n\\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I\\'d love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\\n\"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\\n the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\\n know so much about it? You don\\'t meet many people who are interested\\n in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\\n Think it\\'s kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\\n materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\\n\\n\\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I\\'ve been a space fan all my life. I\\'ve\\n read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\\n and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you\\'d\\n say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\\n\\n\\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it\\'s kind of funny. I was\\n never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\\n after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\\n\\n\\n She frowned. \"I don\\'t believe I know much about that.\"\\n\\n\\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\\n ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\\n keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\\n articles. Says there\\'s enough adverse publicity about space exploration\\n already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship\\'s crammed\\n tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there\\'s\\n precious little room in the conning tower and you\\'re the only man\\n aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there\\'s a whole\\n flock of people aboard, there won\\'t be any such thing as space cafard,\\n but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond\\'s mouth began to tic\\n and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The hot, throbbing rumble\\n whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\\n the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\\n chance! Swiftly O\\'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\\n throbbing rumble changed tone.\\n\\n\\n Old Callahan\\'s voice crackled now through the helmet\\'s ear contact.\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\\n Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn\\'t you lock them controls before\\n blast-off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"If every control hadn\\'t been locked in correct setting,\" O\\'Rielly\\n answered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\\n registered before blast-off—wouldn\\'t it, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know yet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Mr. O\\'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n The icy knot in O\\'Rielly\\'s stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\\n this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O\\'Rielly\\'s? In a\\n hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O\\'Rielly\\n in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\\n had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\\n Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\\n thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\\n aboard gone in a churning cloud.\\n\\n\\n Sweat pouring off him, O\\'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\\n the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn\\'t any\\n more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\\n room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\\n and a meter registered beside the Burnerman\\'s bunk and on the Burner\\n Chief\\'s console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\\n officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O\\'Rielly had been in Four\\'s watch\\n room. Nobody had passed through. O\\'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\\n By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\\n inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\\n\\n\\n Well, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\\n mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O\\'Rielly\\n saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\\n some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\\n his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\\n that way.\\n\\n\\n She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\\n either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\\n O\\'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\\n of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy\\'s most secret dreams. \"I\\n couldn\\'t stand the heat any longer and I couldn\\'t open that big door.\\n So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\\n naturally you couldn\\'t hear me walk out while your back was turned\\n resetting the control.\"\\nO\\'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\\n until she couldn\\'t sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\\n where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\\n breath against woman\\'s supremacy in all matters. That male character\\n trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\\n O\\'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one\\'s person, heard\\n himself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\\n that bother to get out here!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so kind. But I\\'m afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I\\'ll drop a\\n suggestion in the Old Woman\\'s box first chance I get.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\\n that O\\'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\\n her.\\n\\n\\n Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\\n in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\\n when he\\'d been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\\n had a jug to cheer one\\'s parting with one\\'s money.\\n\\n\\n A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\\n flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\\n buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\\n\\n\\n When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\\n what about that control?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What control?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, that little thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O\\'Rielly\\n sharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\\n Lemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\\n again probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly said while bowing\\n gracefully.\\n\\n\\n \"Higher than a swacked skunk\\'s tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\\n snapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\\n Burner Chief Terrence Callahan\\'s mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody\\'s,\\n would be improved by knowledge of she who was in O\\'Rielly\\'s shower now.\\n Not that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\\n Oh, very quite!\\n\\n\\n \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn\\'t I tell you\\n to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman\\'s taking a Venus bigwig\\n on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\\n she\\'ll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she\\'ll do anyway\\n about your fusion control!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\\n been thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\\n myself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O\\'Rielly\\'s shower\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"Venus dames,\" O\\'Rielly said dreamily, \"don\\'t boss anything, do they?\"\\n\\n\\n Callahan yelped like he\\'d been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\\n \"O\\'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\\n Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\\n position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\\n have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan\\'s eyes rolled like the\\n devil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O\\'Rielly, open your big ears\\n whilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\\n\\n\\n \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\\n got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\\n everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\\n it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\\n the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\\n family—everything.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, that\\'s when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\\n with knots in their tails. Before the guys who\\'d brought the Venus\\n dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\\n pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\\n back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\\n Earth again there wouldn\\'t be enough left of Venus to find with an\\n electron microscope.\\n\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\\n notions, right away there wouldn\\'t be enough Earth left to hide in an\\n atom\\'s eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\\n Crazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\\n light years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\\n deal.\\n\\n\\n \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\\n stay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\\n Venus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\\n around a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\\n at bargain basement prices.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O\\'Rielly said, still\\n dreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pray heaven you\\'ll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\\n foot of you! Even though you\\'d know she\\'d be your damnation wouldn\\'t\\n make a whit difference—you\\'d still act sappier than thirty-seven\\n angels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O\\'Rielly. \"Holy\\n hollering saints!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O\\'Rielly responded with an airy\\n laugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\\n lived to tell it, has he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\\n into his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O\\'Rielly snorted.\\n \"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\\n \"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain\\'t you? Some big enough to\\n stuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig\\'s bags,\\n even through customs? Just run \\'em through the big Geiger that tells\\n whether there\\'s any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself\\n one of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig\\'s pile of\\n \\'em.\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when\\n a crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.\\n Started on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his\\n ears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.\\n Wasn\\'t like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\\n\\n\\n With suddenly enlivened interest O\\'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how\\n come you know so much?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\\n to himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I\\'d had\\n a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\\n Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O\\'Rielly\\'s head. \"Look! I was\\n a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\\n twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\\n you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\\n put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain\\'t high\\n on vino and ain\\'t been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\\n feed the Old Woman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly responded cheerfully.\\n\\n\\n \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\\n Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\\n least!\"\\n\\n\\n Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\\n Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\\n was saved! And O\\'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\\n lovely neck and his own forever.\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower door, however, opened abruptly. O\\'Rielly had not\\n opened it. O\\'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\\n his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn\\'t she\\n have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\\n\\n\\n At sight of her, of course, Callahan\\'s eyes near popped from his old\\n head. \"Berta!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I\\'m Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma\\'s\\n name is Berta and people say I\\'m just like she was a hundred and\\n twenty-five years ago.\"\\n\"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\\n was being slapped together again. \"O\\'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\\n pirate, couldn\\'t you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\\n you don\\'t have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\\n don\\'t flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\\n a zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower.\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\\n Trillium. Just like that, O\\'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\\n spiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\\n the doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\\n and coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\\n\\n\\n \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\\n Trillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\\n\\n\\n Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\\n ship. O\\'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don\\'t you\\n worry about another thing!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I\\'m not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\\n way Grandmamma knew it would!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\\n bounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\\n don\\'t tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\\n to know.\\n\\n\\n The watch room\\'s door had opened. Wouldn\\'t think the Old Woman was a\\n day over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\\n probably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\\n Frosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\\n looked at O\\'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\\n\\n\\n Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\\n\\n\\n Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\\n erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\\n robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\\n lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\\n from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\\n of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\\n\\n\\n She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\\n you a question, did I not?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Believe you did, ma\\'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\\n answer is, ma\\'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly and me was\\n discussing—ah—matrimony, ma\\'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O\\'Rielly\\n here is considering it, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\\n Wasn\\'t too bad a fib. The more O\\'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\\n ideas he got of doing things he\\'d never dreamt of before in his life.\\n Yes, ma\\'am!\\n\\n\\n \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman\\'s look was fit to\\n freeze O\\'Rielly\\'s brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\\n down here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, you\\'ll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma\\'am!\"\\n Callahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\\n women—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\\n the control phenomenon, ma\\'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\\n Burnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\\n said with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed \\'twouldn\\'t\\n bother me none if there wasn\\'t one of the things left in the world!\\n Present company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\\n courtly bow.\\n\\n\\n \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan\\'s face,\\n then in O\\'Rielly\\'s vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\\n she muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\\n horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\\n again. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don\\'t you know what your shower is for?\\n Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\\n burner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\\n me, Your Excellency?\"\\n\\n\\n \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O\\'Rielly and Callahan much as\\n he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\\n ever told any Venus man what to do.\\n\\n\\n The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\\n steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\\n blowing her gaskets completely, O\\'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\\n door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\\n of person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\\n Excellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\\n sweat.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\\n first, Your Excellency.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\\n \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\\n\\n\\n No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\\n Woman, a prime symbol of her gender\\'s superiority, whipped a razor edge\\n onto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain\\'s quarters are more\\n satisfactory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\\nSeeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\\n O\\'Rielly\\'s watch room. Was all O\\'Rielly could do to keep from busting\\n out laughing for joy.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\\n betwixt O\\'Rielly\\'s grand brain and Callahan\\'s great experience she\\'d be\\n happy forever.\\n\\n\\n A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\\n yanked open the doors under O\\'Rielly\\'s bunk.\\n\\n\\n \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\\n course.\\n\\n\\n \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\\n sabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Trillium,\" O\\'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\\n keep coming out of hiding just when nobody\\'s going to find you?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O\\'Rielly would have gladly\\n drowned himself if he could.\\n\"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\\n outer space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman\\'s company, and for\\n her leaving her planet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up!\" His Excellency\\'s ear beards were standing straight out\\n sideways. \"I\\'ll handle this!\"\\n\\n\\n \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\\n Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\\n\\n\\n \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\\n back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\\n of Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\\n at that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\\n O\\'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\\n looked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium\\'s brave loveliness and\\n protect it to his last breath of life.\\n\\n\\n Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\\n Panels on opposite walls lit up.\\n\\n\\n \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\\n \"Interplanetary emergency.\"\\n\\n\\n Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\\n pleasant.\\n\\n\\n \"Madame President\\'s office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. President\\'s office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\\n efforts.\"\\n\\n\\n Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\\n Stowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\\n\\n\\n The flunkies\\' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\\n blizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\\n\\n\\n Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\\n facts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\\n\\n\\n The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\\n that were as fierce as an eagle\\'s, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\\n own granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\\n Excellency, \"what\\'s this nonsense?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\\n annoyance.\\n\\n\\n \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\\n \"Some silly female cackling now!\"\\n\\n\\n The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one\\'s left hand on a\\n desk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\\n\\n\\n \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\\n\\n\\n \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\\n those two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\\n myself, and Mr. O\\'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President\\'s ear beards stood near straight up\\n as he roared, \"You couldn\\'t have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\\n tell the truth!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\\n\"Obviously Trillium\\'s poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\\n Excellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn\\'t know the first\\n thing about such things!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I\\'ve been married to her\\n for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she\\'s the finest\\n rattle-brain I ever knew!\"\\n\\n\\n \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\\n years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\\n volcano. \"The year some Earthman.... Never did catch the devil....\\n Berta? Impossible!\"\\n\\n\\n Madame President\\'s shapely finger now rested full on the button that\\n could launch the fleets of war rockets that had been pre-aimed for a\\n thousand years. \"I\\'m afraid your Ambassador is unwelcome now,\" Madame\\n President stated coolly. \"Your granddaughter\\'s actions have every mark\\n of an invasion tactic by your government.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, her actions?\" Grandpapa President\\'s finger now lay\\n poised on the button that had been waiting a thousand years to blow\\n Earth out of the universe. \"My grandchild was kidnapped by men under\\n your official command! Weren\\'t you, Trillium dear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring\\n our cause to the attention of Earth\\'s President. If Earth will only\\n stop buying from Venus, you won\\'t have any money to squander on your\\n wars any longer no matter what happens to we revolutionaries!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Revolutionaries? Such claptrap! And what\\'s wrong with my wars? People\\n have to have something to keep their minds off their troubles! Nobody\\n around here gets hurt. Oh, maybe a few scratches here and there. But\\n nobody on Venus dies from the things any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war they\\n haven\\'t time for us women. That\\'s why we always radiated such a fatal\\n attraction for Earthmen. We want to be loved! We want our own men home\\n doing useful work!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, they do come home and do useful work! Couple weeks every ten\\n months. Proven to be a highly efficient arrangement.\"\\n\\n\\n \"More boys to run off to your old wars and more girls to stay home and\\n be lonely!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now you just listen to me, Trillium!\" Grandpapa President was all\\n Venus manhood laying down the law. \"That\\'s the way things have been on\\n Venus for ten thousand years and all the women in the universe can\\'t\\n change it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have been in constant contact with my Cabinet during these\\n conversations,\" Madame President said crisply. \"Earth is terminating\\n all trade agreements with Venus as of this instant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" Grandpapa\\'s beards near pulled his ears off. \"It\\'s not legal!\\n You can\\'t get away with this!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take your finger off that trigger, boy!\" a heavenly voice similar to\\n Trillium\\'s advised from the Venus panel.\\n\\n\\n Whereupon Grandpapa glared to one side. \"Berta! What are you doing\\n here? I am deciding matters of the gravest interplanetary nature!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Were.\" Features more beautifully mature than Trillium\\'s crowded onto\\n the panel too. \"From now on I\\'m doing the deciding.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense! You\\'re only my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And new President of Venus, elected by unanimous vote of all women.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible! The men run Venus! Nobody\\'s turning this planet into\\n another Earth where a man can\\'t even sneeze unless some woman says so!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take him away, girls,\" Berta ordered coolly, whereupon her spouse was\\n yanked from view.\\n\\n\\n His bellows, however, could be heard yet. \"Unhand me, you fool\\n creatures! Guards! Guards!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Save your breath,\" Berta advised him. \"And while you\\'re in the cooler,\\n enjoy this latest batch of surrender communiques. We women are in\\n control everywhere now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dimmy,\" Trillium was saying firmly to His Excellency, \"you have beat\\n around the bush with me long enough. Now say it!\"\\nDimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\\n Earthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\\n then all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\\n enough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\\n love only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\\n works. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\\n Venus women had our own men in our power.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\\n enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth\\'s\\n tranquility.\"\\n\\n\\n Yes, ma\\'am, O\\'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\\n Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\\n away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\\n from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\\n headache in history.\\n\\n\\n \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\\n perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\\n conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\\n President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\\n\\n\\n \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\\n receive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\\n convenience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\\n moment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\\n communications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\\n broadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\\n top man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\\n over Dimmy\\'s credentials.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\\n graciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\\n Mr. O\\'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\\n revolution better than they knew.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\\n doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\\n best.\"\\n\\n\\n The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\\n Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O\\'Rielly and Callahan.\\n Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\\n old conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\\n before returning to your stations.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, well,\" O\\'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\\n earshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\\n Saturn? Lucky we ain\\'t programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\\n crows for breakfast.\" Callahan\\'s old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\\n grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\\n\\n\\n \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O\\'Rielly\\n said in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\\n did Trillium\\'s Grandmamma let him go?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Venus guys wasn\\'t so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\\n like to himself, \"they\\'d of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\\n guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\\n Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won\\'t be one\\n much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\\n but didn\\'t, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\\n to take over Venus, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n O\\'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\\n before her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did \\'our boy\\' leave\\n Grandmamma?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\\'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn\\'t heard a word O\\'Rielly\\n said, \"you could sweet-talk \\'em, kiss \\'em and hold \\'em tighter\\'n\\n Billy-be-damned. And that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not sure,\" O\\'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, \\'that\\'s all.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\\n Course not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ain\\'t nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma\\'am.\\n Venus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tickles \\'em, boy, tickles \\'em!\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He\\n knocked over the pitcher of\\nthil\\n, but it didn\\'t matter. The pitcher\\n was empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\\n very hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\\n spring them.\\n\\n\\n \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\\n down the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You\\'re kidding!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\\n a curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\\n I\\'m kidding! With Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\\n Space, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he\\'d been a\\n lot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\\n I\\'ve wet-nursed Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\\n eleven years, and I know. It\\'s lousy, it\\'s mangy, it\\'s broken-down!\\n Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\\n\\n\\n I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\\n Buckhalter Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon\\'s face\\n unless he\\'s tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\\n\\n\\n Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\\n grey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\\n girl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\\n slanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\\n toward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\\n\\n\\n I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\\n Shannon\\'s one-seventy-five, and how I\\'m not as young as I used to be.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\\n\\n\\n Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\\n Shannon?\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\\n pleasantly and said, very gently:\\n\\n\\n \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\\n\\n\\n I shot a glance at the newcomer. He\\'d saved me from a beating, even if\\n he was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\\n settled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\\n\\n\\n The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\\n in dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\\n grey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\\n clean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\\n with their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\\n\\n\\n There didn\\'t seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\\n blue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky\\'s.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"I don\\'t think you understand.\"\\n\\n\\n I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\\n back. It sounded like he\\'d ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\\n got my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\\n and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\\n\\n\\n Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\\n\\n\\n I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\\n It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\\n quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\\n\\n\\n Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What\\'s eating you,\\n Jig? I\\'m not going to hurt him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he\\'s got there. Money!\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy looked at me. He hadn\\'t turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\\n \"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I\\'m\\n Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\\n the table. \"I\\'m sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\\n stayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\\n that it wasn\\'t transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\\n ever met, and you couldn\\'t see into those innocent blue eyes any more\\n than you could see through sheet metal.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t like him. I didn\\'t like him at all. But he had money. I said,\\n \"Howdy. Let\\'s go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\\n like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\\n\\n\\n The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\\n Beamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.\"\\nI looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn\\'t\\n say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\\n pitcher of\\nthil\\non the table. Then I cleared my throat.\\n\\n\\n \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\\n\\n\\n Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\\n independent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\\n the burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\\n started to get up. I kicked him under the table.\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\\n\\n\\n He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\\n ignored him. He went on, quietly,\\n\\n\\n \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\\n valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\\n toil and boredom....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\\n entertainment of the—\\nproper\\nsort has been available. I propose to\\n remedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\\n a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\\n speak, and I kicked him again.\\n\\n\\n \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We\\'d have to cancel\\n several engagements....\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\\n\\n\\n \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\\n\\n\\n The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\\n glared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\\n\\n\\n It was Gow, our zoo-man—a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\\n colony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\\n scenery—scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\\n curtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\\n than the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Boss, Gertrude\\'s actin\\' up again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can\\'t you see I\\'m busy?\"\\n\\n\\n Gow\\'s black eyes were unpleasant. \"I\\'m tellin\\' you, Boss, Gertrude\\n ain\\'t happy. She ain\\'t had the right food. If something....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"That\\'ll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn\\'t take much timber to\\n fit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude\\'s unhappy. She\\'s lonesome,\\n see? And if she don\\'t get happier pretty soon I ain\\'t sure your tin-pot\\n ship\\'ll hold her.\"\\n\\n\\n He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\\n cleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\\n\\n\\n \"Gertrude?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah. She\\'s kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\\n finished for him.\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\\n Venusian\\ncansin\\n. The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\\n Brothers, and she\\'s much smaller than Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\\n She was also much younger, but I didn\\'t go into that. Gertrude may be\\n a little creaky, but she\\'s still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\\n wouldn\\'t die on us, because without her we\\'d have a sicker-looking\\n circus than even I could stand.\\n\\n\\n Beamish looked impressed. \"A\\ncansin\\n. Well, well! The mystery\\n surrounding the origin and species of the\\ncansin\\nis a fascinating\\n subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\\n\\n\\n We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We\\'d have to have\\n at least a hundred U.C.\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\\n Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\\n second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\\n stomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\\n agreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\\n off half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\\n\\n\\n \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\\n the morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\\n\\n\\n We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\\n grab for the money, but I beat him to it.\\n\\n\\n \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\\n Here.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I\\'d been holding out. \"We\\n can get lushed enough on this.\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\\n he said suddenly,\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It may be crooked.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete\\'s sake!\" I\\n yelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\\n\\n\\n Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\\n where the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there\\'ll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\\n poked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\\nthildatum\\n!\"\\nIt was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where\\n Shannon\\'s Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late\\n as it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting\\n around and smoking and looking very ugly.\\n\\n\\n It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless\\n under the two moons. There\\'s a smell to Mars, like something dead and\\n dried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown\\n red dust gritted in my teeth.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to\\n the roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his\\n feet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\\n\\n\\n They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I\\n grinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more\\n than money. It grates on a man\\'s pride to have to sneak in and out of\\n his own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in\\n weeks we\\'d come in at the front door.\\n\\n\\n I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,\\n Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.\\n Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\\n\\n\\n \"Now?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Now,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join\\n in. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went\\n home happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\\n\\n\\n The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the\\n green girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the\\n muscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers\\n and joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the\\n passageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\\n \"They\\'re good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I\\'ve\\n rewarded them.\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go see Gertrude.\"\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going\\n into the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I\\'m a city\\n guy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But\\n Bucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a pal, Jif. Bes\\' li\\'l\\' guy inna worl\\'....\"\\n\\n\\n The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he\\'d fall down\\n the ladder and break his neck. That\\'s why I went along. If I hadn\\'t....\\n Oh, well, what\\'s a few nightmares among friends?\\n\\n\\n It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was\\n a dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude\\'s hand. We started down\\n the long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and\\n compression units.\\n\\n\\n Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn\\'t\\n near as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It\\'s\\n the smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,\\n breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled\\n around them as strong as the cage bars.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and\\n then wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.\\n A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,\\n ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\\n\\n\\n It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same\\n time. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I\\n could think of, and I couldn\\'t hear myself doing it. Presently a great\\n metallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow\\n had them nicely conditioned to that gong.\\nBut they didn\\'t quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel\\n them inside you when they\\'re uneasy. I think that\\'s why I\\'m scared of\\n them. They make me feel like I\\'m not human as I thought—like I wanted\\n to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,\\n all of a sudden....\\n\\n\\n Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She\\'s gettin\\'\\n worse,\" he said. \"She\\'s lonesome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an\\n owl\\'s. He swayed slightly. \"That\\'s sure tough.\" He sniffled.\\n\\n\\n I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank\\n and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a\\n deep breath. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever seen a\\ncansin\\n. There\\'s only\\n two of them on the Triangle. If you haven\\'t, nothing I can say will\\n make much difference.\\n\\n\\n They\\'re what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old\\n Dame Nature had an idea that didn\\'t jell. The\\ncansins\\nwere pretty\\n successful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and\\n now there\\'s only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even\\n the Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\\n\\n\\n I wouldn\\'t know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck\\n some place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little\\n bird blood thrown in. Anyway, she\\'s big.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage\\n with her hands—yeah, hands—hanging over her knees and her snaky head\\n sunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.\\n Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\\n\\n\\n The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the\\n mane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes\\n clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like\\n old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\\n\\n\\n Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow!\\n Nobody\\'s ever seen a male\\ncansin\\n. There may not even be any.\"\\n\\n\\n Gertrude screamed again. She didn\\'t move, not even to raise her head.\\n The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That\\n close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold\\n inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You\\'ll have to snap her out of\\n this, Gow. She\\'s driving the rest of \\'em nuts.\"\\n\\n\\n He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood\\n looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he\\n turned to Gertrude.\\n\\n\\n \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak\\'s wreck\\n and everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know\\n her. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a\\n woman\\'s talking about a sick child.\\n\\n\\n \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain\\'t sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well for Pete\\'s sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need\\n her.\" I took Shannon\\'s arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn\\'t look at\\n us. Bucky sobbed.\\n\\n\\n \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But\\n it\\'s all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan\\' me? Like Gow there with\\n Gertrude. She\\'s ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\\n\\n\\n We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed\\n high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all\\n around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\\n\\n\\n Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist\\n rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly\\n with blue, cold fire.\\n\\n\\n I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God\\'s sake!\"\\n\\n\\n I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp\\n and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and\\n roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all\\n I could hear Gertrude\\'s lonely, whistling scream.\\n\\n\\n I thought, \"\\nSomebody\\'s down here. Somebody let \\'em out. Somebody wants\\n to kill us!\\n\" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I\\n sobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\\n\\n\\n One of Bucky\\'s dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I\\n rolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the\\n hollow of his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the\\n back of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my\\n mouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\\n\\n\\n Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\\n \"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I\\'m scared!\"\\n\\n\\n Then I went out.\\nII\\n\\n\\n Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His\\n little brown face was crinkled with laughter. He\\'d lost most of his\\n teeth, and he gummed\\nthak\\n-weed. It smelt.\\n\\n\\n \"You pretty, Mis\\' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\\n\\n\\n He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and\\n said, \"Where\\'s Shannon? How is he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mis\\' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis\\' Jig. Mis\\' Gow come\\n nickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down\\n a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the\\n washstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned\\n snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch\\n plaid. I felt sick.\\n\\n\\n Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was\\n a big burn across his neck. He said:\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\\n\\n\\n I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\\n\\n\\n Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in.\\n Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\\n\\n\\n I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far.\\n Nobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beamish. He realizes he\\'s been gypped.\"\\n\\n\\n \"One hundred U.C.\\'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge\\n mining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\\n\\n\\n I shrugged. \"You\\'re the boss man. I\\'m only the guy that beats off the\\n creditors.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn\\'t a\\n comfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let\\'s go sign.\" He put his hand on the\\n latch and looked at my feet. \"And—uh—Jig, I....\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don\\'t trip me up, that\\'s all!\"\\n\\n\\n We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,\\n and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking\\n like a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian\\n strong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had\\n kittens.\\n\\n\\n Nobody would have minded that, only one of \\'em had only four legs. It\\n lived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out\\n of their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\\n\\n\\n Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.\\n Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It\\n didn\\'t help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at\\n dinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I\\n was ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\\n\\n\\n Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our\\n itinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It\\n was Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a\\n bunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle\\n of it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\\n\\n\\n I saw Beamish\\'s sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and\\n our router\\'s runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\\n\\n\\n \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\\n\\n\\n I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and\\n went out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they\\n weren\\'t happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus\\n heat was already sneaking into the ship.\\n\\n\\n While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,\\n screaming.\\nThe canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in\\n the mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I\\n stood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\\n\\n\\n I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was\\n standing in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her\\n triangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn\\'t have anything on\\n but her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn\\'t\\n sound nice.\\n\\n\\n You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with\\n the electric power they carry in their own bodies. They\\'re Venusian\\n middle-swampers, they\\'re not human, and they never forget it.\\n\\n\\n Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with\\n white reptilian teeth.\\n\\n\\n \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can\\n smell it in the swamp wind.\"\\n\\n\\n The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under\\n her jaw pulsed like a toad\\'s, and her eyes were red.\\n\\n\\n \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken.\\n They are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\\n\\n\\n She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight\\n and cold. Bucky said,\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\\n\\n\\n We weren\\'t half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing\\n field when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We\\n could see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\\n\\n\\n He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or\\n four tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\\n\\n\\n Bucky said, \"Jig—it\\'s Sam Kapper.\"\\n\\n\\n We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled\\n around to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man\\n who crawled and whimpered in the mud.\\n\\n\\n Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and\\n carnivals. He\\'d given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren\\'t\\n too broke, and we were pretty friendly.\\n\\n\\n I hadn\\'t seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed,\\n hard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick,\\n looking down at him.\\n\\n\\n Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over\\n like animals I\\'ve seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over\\n and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\\n\\n\\n I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn\\'t pay much attention. I\\n only caught a glimpse of the man\\'s face as he straightened up. I didn\\'t\\n realize until later that he looked familiar.\\n\\n\\n We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a\\n couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled\\n the curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the\\n cigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\\n\\n\\n Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What\\'s the trouble?\"\\nKapper tried to straighten up. He hadn\\'t shaved. The lean hard lines\\n of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\\n with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man\\'s.\\n\\n\\n He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I\\'d do it, and I did. I found it\\n and brought it out.\"\\n\\n\\n The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn\\'t notice it. \"Help\\n me,\" he said simply. \"I\\'m scared.\" His mouth drooled.\\n\\n\\n \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won\\'t tell \\'em. It\\'s\\n got to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\\n wouldn\\'t let me, and I was afraid they\\'d find it....\"\\n\\n\\n He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don\\'t know\\n how they found out about it, but they did. I\\'ve got to get it back.\\n I\\'ve got to....\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\\n suddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\\n\\n\\n Bucky got up. \"I\\'ll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\\n grabbed his wrist. Kapper\\'s nails were blue and the cords in his hands\\n stood out like guy wires.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t leave me. Got to tell you—where it is. Got to take it back.\\n Promise you\\'ll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\\n breathing.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n Kapper\\'s face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\\n air. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\\n use. Kapper whispered,\\n\\n\\n \"\\nCansin\\n. Male. Only one. You don\\'t know...! Take him back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where is it, Sam?\"\\n\\n\\n I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\\n was standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\\n made a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\\n\\n\\n Beamish never changed expression. He didn\\'t move while Bucky felt\\n Kapper\\'s pulse. Bucky didn\\'t need to say anything. We knew.\\n\\n\\n \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\\n Beamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\\n pushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\\n\\n\\n \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\\n told him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\\n over to the bar.\\n\\n\\n I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\\n place. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch\\n of miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\\n\\n\\n Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\\n did any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\\n\\n\\n The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\\n was a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\\n coiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\\n\\n\\n I leaned on the bar. \"\\nLhak\\n,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\\n green bottle. I reached for it, casually.\\n\\n\\n \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\\n cold. What\\'s he been spiking his drinks with?\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSelak\\n,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\\n behind me. And I remembered him, then.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Or so they thought!\\n\\n Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them\\n\\n five buckos for a glass of water—and got it!\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories May 1943.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nCharacteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity,\\n though his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, with\\n no dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land\\n that had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically\\n into the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his\\n tall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something\\n incoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re delirious!\" Joe cried. \"It\\'s a mirage!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is?\" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.\\n\\n\\n Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,\\n speechless for once.\\n\\n\\n In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea\\n purveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had\\n they seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.\\n\\n\\n Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two\\n hands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the\\n remaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish\\n Harvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this\\n impossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit\\n juice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer\\n things to know there are always more.\"\\n\\n\\n He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:\\n \"Water—quick!\"\\n\\n\\n Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out\\n two glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked\\n for more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender\\n had taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.\\n\\n\\n Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so\\n fast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender\\'s\\n impersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.\\n\\n\\n \"Strangers, eh?\" he asked at last.\\n\\n\\n \"Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,\" Harvey answered in his usual\\n lush manner. \"We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,\\nLa-anago\\n Yergis\\n, the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in\\n the ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in\\n proclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history\\n of therapeutics.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser\\n glasses without washing them. \"Where you heading?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we\\'ve gone\\n without water for five ghastly days.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?\" Joe asked.\\n\\n\\n \"We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don\\'t land\\n here unless they\\'re in trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then where\\'s the water lead-in? We\\'ll fill up and push off.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you gents\\'re\\n finished at the bar, your drinks\\'ll be forty buckos.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey grinned puzzledly. \"We didn\\'t take any whiskey.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Might as well. Water\\'s five buckos a glass. Liquor\\'s free with every\\n chaser.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey\\'s eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That—that\\'s robbery!\" the lanky man\\n managed to get out in a thin quaver.\\n\\n\\n The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain\\'t many customers, you gotta\\n make more on each one. Besides—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty\\n crook—robbing poor spacemen! You—\"\\n\"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\"\\nHarvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the\\n bartender apologetically. \"Don\\'t mind my friend. His adrenal glands are\\n sometimes overactive. You were going to say—?\"\\nThe round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression.\\n\\n\\n \"Folks are always thinkin\\' the other feller\\'s out to do \\'em,\" he said,\\n shaking his head. \"Lemme explain about the water here. It\\'s bitter\\n as some kinds of sin before it\\'s purified. Have to bring it in with\\n buckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I\\n was chargin\\' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge\\n because I gotta.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Friend,\" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight\\n five-bucko bills, \"here is your money. What\\'s fair is fair, and you\\n have put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an\\n unconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man\\'s\\n thirst.\"\\n\\n\\n The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.\\n\\n\\n \"If that\\'s an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor\\'ll discuss filling\\n your tanks. That\\'s me. I\\'m also justice of the peace, official\\n recorder, fire chief....\"\\n\\n\\n \"And chief of police, no doubt,\" said Harvey jocosely.\\n\\n\\n \"Nope. That\\'s my son, Jed. Angus Johnson\\'s my name. Folks here just\\n call me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will\\n you need?\"\\n\\n\\n Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half\\n rations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the\\n quantity, I\\'m able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me\\n more to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,\\n that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with\\n them. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently\\n watched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the\\n proper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and\\n wetted his lips expectantly.\\n\\n\\n Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to\\n do about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be\\n preposterous. We simply can\\'t afford it.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson\\'s response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about\\n charging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.\\n It\\'s just the purified stuff that comes so high.\"\\n\\n\\n After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water\\n pool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed\\n back to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.\\n\\n\\n \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe\\n picked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly,\\n is the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn\\'t something you can\\n get used to in ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from\\n the igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,\\n according to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their\\n buckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.\\nIt was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on\\n a bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\\n in front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\\n a faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\\n investigate.\\n\\n\\n Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\\n that was unmistakably a buried pipe.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\\n to transport water in pails.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\\n\\n\\n \"It leads\\nto\\nthe saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\\n pipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\\n leads\\nfrom\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\\n scrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\\n into the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.\\n\\n\\n Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\\n\\n\\n \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\\n\\n\\n But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\\n tasting it.\\n\\n\\n \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\\n\\n\\n They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\\n His mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The\\n only thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor\\'s\\n conscience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,\" said\\n Harvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. \"Joseph, the good-natured artist in\\n me has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we\\n have had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this\\n point hence.\"\\n\\n\\n Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they\\n stopped and their fists unclenched.\\n\\n\\n \"Thought you gents were leaving,\" the mayor called out, seeing them\\n frozen in the doorway. \"Glad you didn\\'t. Now you can meet my son, Jed.\\n Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\\n\\n\\n Johnson\\'s eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\\n and held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\\n born and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\\n kept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\\n\\n\\n He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\\n hand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\\n his fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\\n one.\\n\\n\\n \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\\n atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\\n unpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\\n\\n\\n \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don\\'t you\\n feel well?\"\\n\\n\\n Even before the others could turn to him, Joe\\'s practiced eyes were\\n gently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\\n drooping like a bloodhound\\'s.\\n\\n\\n \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He\\'s coming\\n down with asteroid fever!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\\n of the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean,\\nonce\\n?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\\n every year, and I ain\\'t hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\\n out of here!\"\\n\\n\\n \"In good time. He can\\'t be moved immediately.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then he\\'ll be here for months!\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\\n his gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\\n in tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\\n frantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\\n cups—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\\n requires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\\n\\n\\n Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\\n rocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\\n few minutes, carrying a bottle.\\nJoe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly\\n crossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient\\'s head tenderly,\\n put the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.\\n When Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner\\n drink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and\\n waited for the inevitable result.\\n\\n\\n Joe\\'s performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several\\n moments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed\\n to perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features\\n straightened out.\\n\\n\\n \"Are—are you all right?\" asked the mayor anxiously.\\n\\n\\n \"Much better,\" said Joe in a weak voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe you need another dose,\" Harvey suggested.\\n\\n\\n Joe recoiled. \"I\\'m fine now!\" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove\\n it.\\n\\n\\n Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe\\'s face,\\n and then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'ll be hanged!\" Johnson ejaculated.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nLa-anago Yergis\\nnever fails, my friend,\" Harvey explained. \"By\\n actual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three\\n minutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught\\n this one before it grew formidable.\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor\\'s eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. \"If you\\n don\\'t charge too much,\" he said warily, \"I might think of buying some.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,\" Harvey replied with dignity.\\n \"It sells itself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Course, I\\'d expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole\\n case,\" said Johnson.\\n\\n\\n \"That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with\\n the vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How much?\" asked the mayor unhappily.\\n\\n\\n \"For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred\\n buckos.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of\\n doing so. \"F-four hundred,\" he offered.\\n\\n\\n \"Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,\" Harvey said flatly.\\n\\n\\n \"Make it four fifty,\" quavered Johnson.\\n\\n\\n \"I dislike haggling,\" said Harvey.\\n\\n\\n The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and\\n fifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: \"And we will include,\\ngratis\\n, an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian\\n handicraftsmanship.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. \"No tricks now. I want a taste of\\n that stuff. You\\'re not switching some worthless junk on me.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The\\n mayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing\\n minute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which\\n the man gradually won.\\n\\n\\n \"There ain\\'t no words for that taste,\" he gulped when it was safe to\\n talk again.\\n\\n\\n \"Medicine,\" Harvey propounded, \"should taste like medicine.\" To Joe he\\n said: \"Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to\\n which we have dedicated ourselves.\"\\n\\n\\n With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the\\n clearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped\\n his murderous silence and cried:\\n\\n\\n \"What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that\\n snake oil?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That was not poison,\" Harvey contradicted quietly. \"It was\\nLa-anago\\n Yergis\\nextract, plus.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Plus what—arsenic?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture\\n our specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling\\n yonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,\\n mind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been\\n swindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have\\n been, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But why use it on me?\" Joe demanded furiously.\\n\\n\\n Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. \"Did Johnson ask to\\n taste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce\\n the same\\nmedicine\\nthat we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a\\n guinea pig for a splendid cause.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, okay,\" Joe said. \"But you shoulda charged him more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which\\n that swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he\\n possesses. We could not be content with less.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, we\\'re starting all right,\" admitted Joe. \"How about that thing\\n with six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can\\'t we grab him off?\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.\\n\\n\\n \"I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.\\n Apparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.\\n At first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our\\n streamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic\\n suckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the\\n audio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous\\n figure to the zoo!\"\\nJoe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried\\n the case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a\\n place of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it\\n down carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave\\n him, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at\\n least as good as the first; he gagged.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted\\n out the money into Harvey\\'s hand, at a moderate rate that precariously\\n balanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain\\n at paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,\\n and asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant\\'s open now.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn\\'t been thinking about\\n food at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s only water we were short of,\" Harvey said apprehensively. \"We\\'ve\\n got rations back at the ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nH-mph!\\n\" the mayor grunted. \"Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.\\n Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you\\'re welcome\\n to our hospitality.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your hospitality,\" said Harvey, \"depends on the prices you charge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if that\\'s what\\'s worrying you, you can stop worrying,\" answered\\n the mayor promptly. \"What\\'s more, the kind of dinner I serve here you\\n can\\'t get anywhere else for any price.\"\\n\\n\\n Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw\\n none.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,\" he said guardedly.\\n\\n\\n Johnson immediately fell into the role of \"mine host.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Come right in, gents,\" he invited. \"Right into the dining room.\"\\n\\n\\n He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or\\n less private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little\\n chance of company.\\n\\n\\n Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with\\n two menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,\\n silverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,\\n which were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.\\n\\n\\n Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were\\n phenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he\\n grinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\"\\n\\n\\n For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the\\n culinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service\\n was as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played\\n deftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian\\nviotars\\n, using his other two\\n hands for waiting on the table.\\n\\n\\n \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey\\n whispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the\\n kitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society\\n hostess\\'s season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum\\n to women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You\\'re right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,\"\\n complained Harvey. \"I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest\\n merchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate\\n our check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor\\'s appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain\\'t often I have\\n visitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\"\\n\\n\\n As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and\\n Harvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in\\n a yelp of horror.\\n\\n\\n \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.—\"How do you arrive at this\\n fantastic, idiotic figure—\\nthree hundred and twenty-eight buckos\\n!\"\\nJohnson didn\\'t answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,\\n not a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty\\n fingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.\\n\\n\\n Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with\\n rage. The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80\\n redsents.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won\\'t pay it!\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you\\'d act like that,\" he said\\n with regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on\\n his vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. \"Afraid I\\'ll have to\\n ask the sheriff to take over.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson, the \"sheriff,\" collected the money, and Johnson, the\\n \"restaurateur,\" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to\\n remain calm.\\n\\n\\n \"My friend,\" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a\\n schoolmasterish severity, \"your long absence from Earth has perhaps\\n made you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the\\n folk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: \\'It is folly\\n to kill a goose that lays golden eggs,\\' and \\'Penny wise is pound\\n foolish.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t get the connection,\" objected Johnson.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put\\n out of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial\\n deal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for\\n the peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the\\n way you have—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who said I wanted to sell him?\" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his\\n fingers together and asked disinterestedly: \"What were you going to\\n offer, anyhow?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It doesn\\'t matter any longer,\" Harvey said with elaborate\\n carelessness. \"Perhaps you wouldn\\'t have accepted it, anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Johnson came back emphatically. \"But what would your\\n offer have been which I would have turned down?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Either one. It don\\'t make no difference. Genius is too valuable to\\n sell.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don\\'t tell me no amount of money would\\n tempt you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nope. But how much did you say?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'ll tell you something,\" said the mayor confidentially. \"When\\n you\\'ve got one thing, you\\'ve got one thing. But when you\\'ve got money,\\n it\\'s the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you\\'ve got money,\\n you can buy this and that and this and that and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This and that,\" concluded Joe. \"We\\'ll give you five hundred buckos.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, gents!\" Johnson remonstrated. \"Why, six hundred would hardly—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You haven\\'t left us much money,\" Harvey put in.\\n\\n\\n The mayor frowned. \"All right, we\\'ll split the difference. Make it\\n five-fifty.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he\\n stood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively\\n acquired.\\n\\n\\n \"I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,\" he said to\\n Johnson. \"I should imagine you will be rather lonely, with only your\\n filial mammoth to keep you company.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I sure will,\" Johnson confessed glumly. \"I got pretty attached to\\n Genius, and I\\'m going to miss him something awful.\"\\n\\n\\n Harvey forcibly removed his eyes from the native, who was clearing off\\n the table almost all at once.\\n\\n\\n \"My friend,\" he said, \"we take your only solace, it is true, but in his\\n place we can offer something no less amazing and instructive.\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor\\'s hand went protectively to his pocket. \"What is it?\" he\\n asked with the suspicion of a man who has seen human nature at its\\n worst and expects nothing better.\\n\\n\\n \"Joseph, get our most prized belonging from the communications room of\\n the ship,\" Harvey instructed. To Johnson he explained: \"You must see\\n the wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner\\n will soon have it here for your astonishment.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe\\'s face grew as glum as Johnson\\'s had been. \"Aw, Harv,\" he\\n protested, \"do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were\\n getting the key!\"\\n\\n\\n \"We must not be selfish, my boy,\" Harvey said nobly. \"We have had our\\n chance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might\\n have more success than we. Go, Joseph. Bring it here.\"\\n\\n\\n Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.\\nOn a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson\\'s curiosity\\n would probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with\\n questions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For\\n his part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba\\n until Joe came in, lugging a radio.\\n\\n\\n \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes\\n you think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and\\n political speech-makers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word,\\n and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,\\n with the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor\\n of this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I ain\\'t in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly.\\n\\n\\n Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.\\n He has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our\\n study, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an\\n enormous fortune.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, that\\'s no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I\\'m glad he did\\n turn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole\\n years.\"\\n\\n\\n He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain\\'t\\nsaying\\nI\\'ll buy, but what\\n is it I\\'m turning down?\"\\n\\n\\n Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face\\n sorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.\\n\\n\\n \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among\\n the chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before\\n his tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He\\n banged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again,\\n that was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor\\'s enemies to discredit\\n his greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!\"\\n\\n\\n \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out.\\n\\n\\n \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered\\n that the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by\\n energy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the\\n inhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than\\n ourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would\\n find himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.\\n\\n\\n \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor\\n Dean\\'s magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\"\\n\\n\\n The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared\\n thoughtfully at the battered cabinet.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, let\\'s say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he\\n conceded. \"But how could you understand what they\\'re saying? Folks up\\n there wouldn\\'t talk our language.\"\\n\\n\\n Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy\\n lie that broke Dean\\'s spirit and drove him to suicide?\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson recoiled. \"No—no,\\nof course not\\n. I mean, being up here, I\\n naturally couldn\\'t get all the details.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I\\'m sorry I lost my temper.\\n But it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts\\n emanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be\\n so difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was\\n communication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired\\n our language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own\\n hyper-scientific trimmings?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, I don\\'t know,\" Johnson said in confusion.\\n\\n\\n \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect\\n the simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed\\n broadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor\\n failed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could\\n stand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to\\n solve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be\\n rewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\\n could devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\\n person with unusual patience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain\\'t exactly flighty.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

ALLEN MORRISSEY\\nScience equipped David Corbin with borrowed time;\\n \\nsent him winging out in a state of suspension to future\\n \\ncenturies ... to a dark blue world whose only defense\\n \\nwas to seal tight the prying minds of foolish interlopers.\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories November 1952.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nI heard the voice as I opened my eyes. I was lying down, still not\\n aware of where I was, waiting for the voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Your name is David Corbin. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\\n I looked in the direction of the sound. Above my feet a bulkhead\\n loomed. There were round dials set in a row above a speaker. Over the\\n mesh-covered speaker, two knobs glowed red. I ran the words over in\\n my sluggish mind, thinking about an answer. The muscles in my throat\\n tightened up in reflex as I tried to bring some unity into the jumble\\n of thoughts and ideas that kept forming. One word formed out of the\\n rush of anxiety.\\n\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n\\n I shouted a protest against the strangeness of the room. I looked to\\n the right, my eyes following the curving ceiling that started at the\\n cot. The curve met another straight bulkhead on the left. I was in a\\n small room, gray in color, like dull metal. Overhead a bright light\\n burned into my vision. I wondered where in the universe I was.\\n\\n\\n \"Your name is David Corbin. If you understand, press button A on your\\n right.\"\\n\\n\\n I stared at the speaker in the wall. The mesh-covered hole and the two\\n lights looked like a caricature of a face, set in a panel of dials. I\\n twisted my head to look for the button. I pushed away from the close\\n wall but I couldn\\'t move. I reached down to the tightness that held my\\n body, found the wide strap that held me and fumbled with the buckle.\\n I threw it off and pushed myself up from the hard cot. I heard myself\\n yell in surprise as I floated up towards the light overhead.\\n\\n\\n I was weightless.\\n\\n\\n How do you describe being weightless when you are born into a world\\n bound by gravity. I twisted and shut my eyes in terror. There was no\\n sensation of place, no feeling of up or down, no direction. My back\\n bumped against the ceiling and I opened my eyes to stare at the cot and\\n floor. I was concentrating too hard on remembering to be frightened for\\n long. I pushed away from the warm metal and the floor moved up to meet\\n me.\\n\\n\\n \"If you understand, press button A on your right.\"\\n\\n\\n What should I understand? That I was floating in a room that had a\\n curved wall ... that nothing was right in this hostile room?\\n\\n\\n When I reached the cot I held it and drew myself down. I glanced at the\\n planes of the room, trying to place it with other rooms I could see in\\n my mind. Gray walls with a crazy curved ceiling ... a door to my left\\n that appeared to be air tight.\\n\\n\\n I stared at my familiar hands. I rubbed them across my face, feeling\\n the solidity of flesh and bone, afraid to think too hard about myself.\\n\\n\\n \"My name ... my name is....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your name is David Corbin.\"\\n\\n\\n I stared at the speaker. How long did this go on? The name meant\\n nothing to me, but I thought about it, watching the relentless lights\\n that shone below the dials. I stood up slowly and looked at myself. I\\n was naked except for heavy shorts, and there was no clue to my name in\\n the pockets. The room was warm and the air I had been breathing was\\n good but it seemed wrong to be dressed like this. I didn\\'t know why. I\\n thought about insanity, and the room seemed to fit my thoughts. When\\n the voice repeated the message again I had to act. Walking was like\\n treading water that couldn\\'t be seen or felt.\\n\\n\\n I floated against the door, twisting the handle in fear that it\\n wouldn\\'t turn. The handle clanged as I pushed it down and I stared at\\n the opposite wall of a narrow gray passageway. I pushed out into it and\\n grasped the metal rail that ran along the wall. I reasoned it was there\\n to propel yourself through the passageway in this weightless atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n It was effortless to move. I turned on my side like a swimmer and went\\n hand over hand, shooting down the corridor. I braced against forward\\n motion and stopped against a door at the end. Behind me I could see the\\n opened door I had left, and the thought of that questioning voice made\\n me want to move. I swung the door open, catching a glimpse of a room\\n crowded with equipment and....\\nI will always remember the scream of terror, the paralyzing fright of\\n what I saw through the portholes in the wall of the room. I saw the\\n blackest night, pierced by brilliance that blinded me. There was no\\n depth to the searing brightness of countless stars. They seemed to\\n press against the glass, blobs of fire against a black curtain burning\\n into my eyes and brain.\\n\\n\\n It was space.\\n\\n\\n I looked out at deep space, star systems in clusters. I shut my eyes.\\n When I looked again I knew where I was. Why the little room had been\\n shaped like quarter round. Why I drifted weightlessly. Why I was....\\n\\n\\n David Corbin.\\n\\n\\n I knew more of the puzzle. Something was wrong. After the first shock\\n of looking out, I accepted the fact that I was in a space ship, yet I\\n couldn\\'t read the maps that were fastened to a table, nor understand\\n the function or design of the compact machinery.\\n\\n\\n WHY, Why, Why? The thought kept pounding at me. I was afraid to touch\\n anything in the room. I pressed against the clear window, wondering if\\n the stars were familiar. I had a brief vivid picture of a night sky on\\n Earth. This was not the same sky.\\n\\n\\n Back in the room where I had awakened, I touched the panel with the\\n glowing eyes. It had asked me if I understood. Now it must tell me why\\n I didn\\'t. It had to help me, that flat metallic voice that repeated the\\n same words. It must tell me....\\n\\n\\n \"Your name is David Corbin. If you understand, press button A on your\\n right.\"\\n\\n\\n I pressed the button by the cot. The red lights blinked out as I stood\\n in patient attention, trying to outguess the voice. I recalled a\\n phrase ... some words about precaution.\\n\\n\\n Precaution against forgetting.\\n\\n\\n It was crazy, but I trusted the panel. It was the only thing I saw that\\n could help me, guard me against another shock like seeing outside of\\n the clear portholes.\\n\\n\\n \"It is assumed the experiment is a success,\" the voice said.\\n\\n\\n What experiment?\\n\\n\\n \"You have been removed from suspension. Assume manual control of this\\n ship.\"\\n\\n\\n Control of a ship? Going where?\\n\\n\\n \"Do not begin operations until the others are removed from suspension.\"\\n\\n\\n What others? Tell me what to do.\\n\\n\\n \"Rely on instructions for factoring when you check the coordinates.\\n Your maximum deviation from schedule cannot exceed two degrees. Adopt\\n emergency procedures as you see fit. Good luck.\"\\n\\n\\n The voice snapped off and I laughed hysterically. None of it had made\\n sense, and I cursed whatever madness had put me here.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me what to do,\" I shouted wildly. I hammered the hard metal until\\n the pain in my hands made me stop.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t remember what to do.\"\\n\\n\\n I held my bruised hands to my mouth, and I knew that was all the\\n message there was. In blind panic I pushed away from the panel.\\n Something tripped me and I fell back in a graceless arc. I pushed away\\n from the floor, barely feeling the pain in my leg, and went into the\\n hall.\\n\\n\\n Pain burned along my leg but I couldn\\'t stop. In the first panic of\\n waking up in strangeness I had missed the other doors in the passage.\\n The first swung back to reveal a deep closet holding five bulky suits.\\n The second room was like my own. A dark haired, deep chested man lay on\\n the cot. His muscular body was secured by a wide belt. He was as still\\n as death, motionless without warmth or breath as I hovered over him.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t remember his face.\\n\\n\\n The next room held another man. He was young and wiry, like an athlete\\n cast in marble, dark haired and big jawed. A glassy eye stared up when\\n I rolled back his eyelid. The eyelid remained open until I closed it\\n and went on. Another room ... another man ... another stranger. This\\n man was tall and raw boned, light of skin and hair, as dead as the\\n others.\\n\\n\\n A flat, illogical voice had instructed me to revive these men. I\\n shivered in spite of the warmth of the room, studying the black box\\n that squatted on a shelf by his head. My hand shook when I touched\\n the metal. I dared not try to operate anything. Revive the others ...\\n instructions without knowledge were useless to me. I stopped looking\\n into the doors in the passageway and went back to the room with the\\n portholes. Everything lay in readiness, fastened down star charts,\\n instruments, glittering equipment. There was no feeling of disorder or\\n use in the room. It waited for human hands to make it operate.\\n\\n\\n Not mine. Not now.\\n\\n\\n I went past the room into another, where the curves were more sharp. I\\n could visualize the tapering hull leading to the nose of the ship. This\\n room was filled with equipment that formed a room out of the bordered\\n area I stood in. I sat in the deep chair facing the panel of dials and\\n instruments, in easy reach. I ran my hands over the dials, the rows of\\n smooth colored buttons, wondering.\\n\\n\\n The ports on the side were shielded and I stared out at static energy,\\n hung motionless in a world of searing light. There was no distortion,\\n no movement outside and I glanced back at the dials. What speeds were\\n they recording? What speeds and perhaps, what distance? It was useless\\n to translate the markings. They stood for anything I might guess, and\\n something kept pricking my mind, telling me I had no time to guess. I\\n thought of time again. I was supposed to act according to ... plan. Did\\n that mean ... in time ... in time. I went back down the passageway.\\nThe fourth small room was the same. Except for the woman. She lay on a\\n cot, young and beautiful, even in the death-like immobility I had come\\n to accept. Her beauty was graceful lines of face and her figure—smooth\\n tapering legs, soft curves that were carved out of flesh colored stone.\\n Yet not stone. I held her small hand, then put it back on the cot. Her\\n attire was brief like the rest of us, shorts and a man\\'s shirt. Golden\\n hair curled up around her lovely face. I wondered if she would ever\\n smile or move that graceful head. I rolled back her eyelid and looked\\n at a deep blue eye that stared back in glassy surprise. Four people in\\n all, depending on a blind helpless fool who didn\\'t know their names or\\n the reason for that dependence. I sat beside her on the cot until I\\n could stand it no longer.\\n\\n\\n Searching the ship made me forget my fear. I hoped I would find some\\n answers. I went from the nose to the last bulkhead in a frenzy of\\n floating motion, looking behind each door until I went as far as I\\n could. There were two levels to the ship. They both ended in the lead\\n shield that was set where the swell of the curve was biggest. It meant\\n the engine or engines took up half the ship, cut off from the forward\\n half by the instrument studded shield. I retraced my steps and took a\\n rough estimate of size. The ship, as I called it, was at least four\\n hundred feet long, fifty feet in diameter on the inside.\\n\\n\\n The silence was a force in itself, pressing down from the metal walls,\\n driving me back to the comforting smallness of the room where I had\\n been reborn. I laughed bitterly, thinking about the aptness of that. I\\n had literally been reborn in this room, equipped with half ideas, and\\n no point to start from, no premise to seek. I sensed the place to start\\n from was back in the room. I searched it carefully.\\n\\n\\n Minutes later I realized the apparatus by the cot was different. It\\n was the same type of black box, but out from it was a metal arm, bent\\n in a funny angle. At the tip of the arm, a needle gleamed dully and I\\n rubbed the deep gash on my leg. I bent the arm back until the angle\\n looked right. It was then I realized the needle came to a spot where it\\n could have hit my neck when I lay down. My shout of excitement rang out\\n in the room, as I pictured the action of the extended arm. I lost my\\n sudden elation in the cabin where the girl lay. The box behind her head\\n was completely closed, and it didn\\'t yield to the pressure I applied.\\n It had a cover, but no other opening where an arm could extend. I ran\\n my fingers over the unbroken surface, prying over the thin crack at\\n the base helplessly. If some sort of antidote was to be administered\\n manually I was lost. I had no knowledge of what to inject or where to\\n look for it. The chamber of the needle that had awakened me was empty.\\n That meant a measured amount.\\n\\n\\n In the laboratory on the lower level I went over the rows of cans and\\n tubes fastened to the shelves. There were earths and minerals, seeds\\n and chemicals, testing equipment in compact drawers, but nothing marked\\n for me. I wondered if I was an engineer or a pilot, or perhaps a doctor\\n sent along to safeguard the others. Complete amnesia would have been\\n terrible enough but this half knowledge, part awareness and association\\n with the ship was a frightening force that seemed ready to break out of\\n me.\\n\\n\\n I went back to the cabin where the powerful man lay. I had to risk\\n failure with one of them. I didn\\'t want it to be the girl. I fought\\n down the thought that he might be the key man, remembering the voice\\n that had given the message. It was up to me, and soon. The metal in the\\n box would have withstood a bullet. It couldn\\'t be pried apart, and I\\n searched again and again for a release mechanism.\\n\\n\\n I found it.\\n\\n\\n I swung the massive cover off and set it down. The equipment waited for\\n the touch of a button and it went into operation. I stepped back as the\\n tubes glowed to life and the arm swung down with the gleaming needle.\\n The needle went into the corded neck of the man. The fluid chamber\\n drained under pressure and the arm moved back.\\n\\n\\n I stood by the man for long minutes. Finally it came. He stirred\\n restlessly, closing his hands into fists. The deep chest rose and fell\\n unevenly as he breathed. Finally the eyes opened and he looked at me.\\n I watched him adjust to the room. It was in his eyes, wide at first,\\n moving about the confines of the room back to me.\\n\\n\\n \"It looks like we made it,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n He unfastened the belt and sat up. I pushed him back as he floated up\\n finding little humor in the comic expression on his face.\\n\\n\\n \"No gravity,\" he grunted and sat back.\\n\\n\\n \"You get used to it fast,\" I answered. I thought of what to say as he\\n watched me. \"How do you feel?\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged at the question. \"Fine, I guess. Funny, I can\\'t remember.\"\\n\\n\\n He saw it in my face, making him stop. \"I can\\'t remember dropping off\\n to sleep,\" he finished.\\n\\n\\n I held his hard arm. \"What else? How much do you remember?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m all right,\" he answered. \"There aren\\'t supposed to be any effects\\n from this.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who is in charge of this ship?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n He tensed suddenly. \"You are, sir. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n I moved away from the cot. \"Listen, I can\\'t remember. I don\\'t know your\\n name or anything about this ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean? What can\\'t you remember?\" he asked. He stood up\\n slowly, edging around towards the door. I didn\\'t want to fight him. I\\n wanted him to understand. \"Look, I\\'m in trouble. Nothing fits, except\\n my name.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t know me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you serious?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. I don\\'t know why but it\\'s happened.\"\\n\\n\\n He let his breath out in a whistle. \"For God\\'s sake. Any bump on your\\n head?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I feel all right physically. I just can\\'t place enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The others. What about the others?\" he blurted.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know. You\\'re the first besides myself. I don\\'t know how I\\n stumbled on the way to revive you.\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head, watching me like I was a freak. \"Let\\'s check the\\n rest right away.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. I\\'ve got to know if they are like me. I\\'m afraid to think they\\n might be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe it\\'s temporary. We can figure something out.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n The second man, the dark haired one, opened his eyes and recognized us.\\n He asked questions in rapid fire excitement. The third man, the tall\\n Viking, was all right until he moved. The weightless sensation made him\\n violently sick. We put him back on the cot, securing him again with\\n the belt, but the sight of us floating made him shake. He was retching\\n without results when we drifted out. I followed him to the girl\\'s\\n quarters.\\n\\n\\n \"What about her. Why is she here?\" I asked my companion.\\n\\n\\n He lifted the cover from the apparatus. \"She\\'s the chemist in the crew.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A girl?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dr. Thiesen is an expert, trained for this,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I looked at her. She looked anything but like a chemist.\\n\\n\\n \"There must be men who could have been sent. I\\'ve been wondering why a\\n girl.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know why, Captain. You tried to stop her before. Age and\\n experience were all that mattered to the brass.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a bad thing to do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose. The mission stated one chemist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is the mission of this ship?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n He held up his hand. \"We\\'d better wait, sir. Everything was supposed to\\n be all right on this end. First you, then Carl, sick to his stomach.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay. I\\'ll hold the questions until we see about her.\"\\n\\n\\n We were out of luck with the girl. She woke up and she was frightened.\\n We questioned her and she was coherent but she couldn\\'t remember. I\\n tried to smile as I sat on the cot, wondering what she was thinking.\\n\\n\\n \"How do you feel?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n Her face was a mask of wide-eyed fear as she shook her head.\\n\\n\\n \"Can you remember?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know.\" Blue eyes stared at me in fear. Her voice was low.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you know my name?\"\\n\\n\\n The question frightened her. \"Should I? I feel so strange. Give me a\\n minute to think.\"\\n\\n\\n I let her sit up slowly. \"Do you know your name?\"\\n\\n\\n She tightened up in my arms. \"Yes. It\\'s....\" She looked at us for help,\\n frightened by the lack of clothing we wore, by the bleak room. Her eyes\\n circled the room. \"I\\'m afraid,\" she cried. I held her and she shook\\n uncontrollably.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s happened to me?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n The dark haired man came into the room, silent and watchful. My\\n companion motioned to him. \"Get Carl and meet us in Control.\"\\n\\n\\n The man looked at me and I nodded. \"We\\'ll be there in a moment. I\\'m\\n afraid we\\'ve got trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded and pushed away from us. The girl screamed and covered her\\n face with her hands. I turned to the other man. \"What\\'s your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Croft. John Croft.\"\\n\\n\\n \"John, what are your duties if any?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Automatic control. I helped to install it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can you run this ship? How about the other two?\"\\n\\n\\n He hit his hands together. \"You fly it, sir. Can\\'t you think?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m trying. I know the ship is familiar, but I\\'ve looked it over.\\n Maybe I\\'m trying too hard.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You flew her from earth until we went into suspension,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t remember when,\" I said. I held the trembling girl against me,\\n shaking my head.\\n\\n\\n He glanced at the girl. \"If the calculations are right it was more than\\n a hundred years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n We assembled in the control room for a council. We were all a little\\n better for being together. John Croft named the others for me. I\\n searched each face without recognition. The blond man was Carl Herrick,\\n a metallurgist. His lean face was white from his spell but he was\\n better. Paul Sample was a biologist, John said. He was lithe and\\n restless, with dark eyes that studied the rest of us. I looked at the\\n girl. She was staring out of the ports, her hands pressed against the\\n transparent break in the smooth wall. Karen Thiesen was a chemist, now\\n frightened and trying to remember.\\n\\n\\n I wasn\\'t in much better condition. \"Look, if it comes too fast for me,\\n for any of us, we\\'ll stop. John, you can lead off.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You ask the questions,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I indicated the ship. \"Where in creation are we going?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We set out from Earth for a single star in the direction of the center\\n of our Galaxy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"From Earth? How could we?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s move slowly, sir,\" he said. \"We\\'re moving fast. I don\\'t know if\\n you can picture it, but we\\'re going about one hundred thousand miles an\\n hour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Through space?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What direction?\"\\n\\n\\n Paul cut in. \"It\\'s a G type star, like our own sun in mass and\\n luminosity. We hope to find a planetary system capable of supporting\\n life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t grasp it. How can we go very far in a lifetime?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can be done in two lifetimes,\" John said quietly.\\n\\n\\n \"You said I had flown this ship. You meant before this suspension.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. That\\'s why we can cross space to a near star.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How long ago was it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was set at about a hundred years, sir. Doesn\\'t that fit at all?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s possible.\"\\n\\n\\n Carl caught my eye. \"Captain, we save this time without aging at all.\\n It puts us near a calculated destination.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve lost our lifetime.\" It was Karen. She had been crying silently\\n while we talked.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t think about it,\" Paul said. \"We can still pull this out all\\n right if you don\\'t lose your nerve.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are we to do?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n John answered for me. \"First we\\'ve got to find out where we are. I know\\n this ship but I can\\'t fly it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can I?\" I asked.\\nWe set up a temporary plan of action. Paul took Karen to the laboratory\\n in an effort to help her remember her job. Carl went back to divide the\\n rations.\\n\\n\\n I was to study the charts and manuals. It was better than doing\\n nothing, and I went into the navigation room and sat down. Earth was\\n an infinitesimal point somewhere behind us on the galactic plane, and\\n no one else was trained to navigate. The ship thundered to life as I\\n sat there. The blast roared once ... twice, then settled into a muted\\n crescendo of sound that hummed through the walls. I went into the\\n control room and watched John at the panel.\\n\\n\\n \"I wish I knew what you were doing,\" I said savagely.\\n\\n\\n \"Give it time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We can\\'t spare any, can we?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I wish we knew. What about her—Dr. Thiesen?\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s in the lab. I don\\'t think that will do much good. She\\'s got to\\n be shocked out of a mental state like that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I guess you\\'re right,\" he said slowly. \"She\\'s trained to administer\\n the suspension on the return trip.\"\\n\\n\\n I let my breath out slowly. \"I didn\\'t think about that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We couldn\\'t even get part way back in a lifetime,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"How old are you, John?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Twenty-eight.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thirty.\" He stared at the panel in thought for a minutes. \"What about\\n shock treatment? It sounds risky.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know. It\\'s the only thing I could think of. Why didn\\'t everyone\\n react the same?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That had me wondering for a while. I don\\'t know. Anyway how could you\\n go about making her remember?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Throw a crisis, some situation at her, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged, letting his sure hands rest on the panel of dials. I\\n headed back towards the lab. If I could help her I might help myself.\\n I was past the rooms when the horn blasted through the corridor. I\\n turned automatically with the sound, pushing against the rail, towards\\n the control room. Deep in my mind I could see danger, and without\\n questioning why I knew I had to be at Control when the sound knifed\\n through the stillness. John was shouting as I thrust my way into the\\n room.\\n\"Turn the ship. There\\'s something dead ahead.\"\\n\\n\\n I had a glimpse of his contorted face as I dove at the control board.\\n My hands hit buttons, thumbed a switch and then a sudden force threw me\\n to the right. I slammed into the panel on the right, as the pressure\\n of the change dimmed my vision. Reflex made me look up at the radar\\n control screen.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t operating.\\n\\n\\n John let go of the padded chair, grinning weakly. I was busy for a few\\n seconds, feeding compensation into the gyros. Relief flooded through me\\n like warm liquid. I hung on the intercom for support, drawing air into\\n my heaving lungs.\\n\\n\\n \"What—made you—think of that,\" I asked weakly.\\n\\n\\n \"Shock treatment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I must have acted on instinct.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You did. Even for a sick man that was pretty fast,\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\n \"I can think again, John. I know who I am,\" I shouted. I threw my arms\\n around his massive shoulders. \"You did it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You gave me the idea, Mister, talking about Dr. Thiesen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It worked. I\\'m okay,\" I said in giddy relief.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t have to tell you I was scared as hell. I wish you could have\\n seen your face, the look in your eyes when I woke up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t want to wake up like that again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re all right now?\" he asked. I grinned and nodded an answer. I saw\\n John as he was at the base, big and competent, sweating in the blazing\\n sun.\\n\\n\\n I thought about the rest of the crew too. \"We\\'re heading right for a\\n star....\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s been dead ahead for hours,\" he grunted. I leaned over and threw\\n the intercom to open. \"This is control. Listen ... everyone. I\\'m over\\n it. Disregard the warning siren ... we were testing the ship.\"\\n\\n\\n The lab light blinked on as Paul cut in. \"What was it ... hey, you said\\n you\\'re all right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"John did it. He hit the alarm figuring I would react. Listen, Paul. Is\\n any one hurt?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. Carl is here too. His stomach flopped again but he\\'s okay. What\\n about food. We\\'re supposed to be checked before we eat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll have to go ahead without it. Any change?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I put her to bed. Shall I bring food?\"\\n\\n\\n I glanced at John. He rubbed his stomach. \"Yes,\" I answered. \"Bring it\\n when you can. I\\'ve got to find out where we are.\"\\n\\n\\n We had to get off course before we ran into the yellow-white star that\\n had been picked for us. Food was set down by me, grew cold and was\\n carried away and I was still rechecking the figures. We were on a line\\n ten degrees above the galactic plane. The parallactic baseline from\\n Earth to the single star could be in error several degrees, or we could\\n be right on the calculated position of the star. The radar confirmed\\n my findings ... and my worst fears. When we set it for direction and\\n distance, the screen glowed to life and recorded the star dead ahead.\\n\\n\\n In all the distant star clusters, only this G type star was thought to\\n have a planetary system like our own. We were out on a gamble to find\\n a planet capable of supporting life. The idea had intrigued scientists\\n before I had first looked up at the night sky. When I was sure the\\n electronically recorded course was accurate for time, I checked\\n direction and speed from the readings and plotted our position. If I\\n was right we were much closer than we wanted to be. The bright pips on\\n the screen gave us the distance and size of the star while we fed the\\n figures into the calculator for our rate of approach.\\n\\n\\n Spectroscopic tests were run on the sun and checked against the figures\\n that had been calculated on Earth. We analyzed temperature, magnetic\\n fields, radial motion, density and luminosity, checking against the\\n standards the scientists had constructed. It was a G type star like our\\n own. It had more density and temperature and suitable planets or not,\\n we had to change course in a hurry. Carl analyzed the findings while we\\n came to a decision. Somewhere along an orbit that might be two hundred\\n miles across, our hypothetical planet circled this star. That distance\\n was selected when the planets in Earth\\'s solar system had proved to be\\n barren. If the observations on this star were correct, we could expect\\n to find a planet in a state of fertility ... if it existed ... if it\\n were suitable for colonization ... if we could find it.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,\\n crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance\\n Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\\n\\n\\n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the\\n wire as the scrambler went into operation.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I\\'m set up in Elsby. Grammond\\'s boys\\n are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I\\'m not sitting in this\\n damned room crouched over a dial. I\\'ll be out and around for the rest\\n of the afternoon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered\\n hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond—I can\\'t\\n wait another. I don\\'t mind telling you certain quarters are pressing\\n me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you\\'ve got\\n some answers to go with the questions?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind\\n that. This fellow Margrave—General Margrave. Project Officer for the\\n hyperwave program—he\\'s been on my neck day and night. I can\\'t say I\\n blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret\\n project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.\\n Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let\\n me do it my way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator\\n could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home\\n area—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t have to justify yourself. Just don\\'t hold out on me. I\\n sometimes wonder if I\\'ve seen the complete files on this—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I\\'m\\n warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\"\\nTremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street\\n and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY\\n MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a\\n heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind\\n an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the\\n opposite corner of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of\\n authority.\\n\\n\\n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It\\'s been a while,\\n though.\"\\n\\n\\n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He\\n came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What\\n brings you back to the boondocks?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\\n\\n\\n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a\\n visit to the old home town. Between us, there\\'s more.\"\\n\\n\\n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv\\'ment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It won\\'t take long to tell; we don\\'t know much yet.\" Tremaine covered\\n the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the\\n high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission\\n produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He\\n passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric\\n circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\\n\\n\\n \"I think what we\\'re getting is an echo effect from each of these\\n points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction\\n pattern—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I\\'ll take your\\n word for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we\\'ve got it narrowed down to this\\n section. I\\'m not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter\\'s\\n near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the\\n news that Old Man Whatchamacallit\\'s got an attic full of gear he says\\n is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven\\'t even taken\\n to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord\\n intended.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had\\n something ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there\\'s always Mr. Bram ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a\\n hundred years old when I was kid.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his\\n groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what about him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing. But he\\'s the town\\'s mystery man. You know that. A little\\n touched in the head.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine\\n said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something\\n I\\'ve forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he\\'d teach me.\\n I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and\\n sometimes he gave us apples.\"\\n\"I\\'ve never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this\\n town is about foreigners, especially when they\\'re a mite addled. Bram\\n has blue eyes and blond hair—or did before it turned white—and he\\n talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an\\n ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He\\'s foreign, all right.\\n But we never did know where he came from.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How long\\'s he lived here in Elsby?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about\\n ancestors and such as that? She couldn\\'t remember about Mr. Bram. She\\n was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he\\'d lived in that same\\n old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died\\n five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every\\n Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened\\n then?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He\\'s got a boy, name of Hull. He\\'s Soup all\\n over again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in\\n the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around\\n with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the\\n prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the\\n other drug store....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Soup\\'s been in the pen since then. His boy Hull\\'s the same kind. Him\\n and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram\\'s place one night and set it\\n on fire.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What was the idea of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was\\n passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here\\n for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke\\n routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of \\'em but Hull are back\\n in the streets playin\\' with matches by now. I\\'m waiting for the day\\n they\\'ll make jail age.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any\\n dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh hoh, you\\'re a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew\\n about Mr. Bram—the young Mr. Bram—and Linda Carroll.\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired\\n by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in\\n her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I\\n remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.\\n Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to\\n think she was some kind of princess....\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\"\\nJess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,\\n frowning. \"This would ha\\' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more\\'n\\n eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties—and that made\\n her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting\\n her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six\\n foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair—and a stranger to\\n boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local\\n bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny\\n about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But\\n this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down\\n there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,\\n practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy\\n shay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off\\n her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was\\n ten years \\'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was\\n already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram\\n in front of her.\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I\\'d appreciate it if you\\'d keep your ears\\n and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.\\n Meantime, I\\'m just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn\\'t you say you had some kind of\\n detector you were going to set up?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I\\'ll be setting it up\\n in my room over at the hotel.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When\\'s this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\\n\\n\\n \"After dark. I\\'m working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely\\n repeating logarithmic sequence, based on—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You\\'re over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me\\n know if you want anything. And by the way—\" he winked broadly—\"I\\n always did know who busted Soup Gaskin\\'s nose and took out his front\\n teeth.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town\\n Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow\\n autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the\\n steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,\\n a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said\\n \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\\n\\n\\n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at\\n Tremaine.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re closed,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"I won\\'t be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the\\n Bram property changed hands last.\"\\n\\n\\n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?\\n He dead?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\\n\\n\\n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain\\'t going to\\n sell, mister, if that\\'s what you want to know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\\n\\n\\n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping\\n to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.\\n A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man\\'s eyes darted toward\\n it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\\n\\n\\n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where\\n a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a\\n line written in faded ink:\\n\\n\\n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter\\n Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32msee Vol. 9 &amp; cet.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\"\\n\\n\\n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the\\n nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That\\'s all I needed.\" He turned back to\\n the door.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of\\n trouble?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. No trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"\\n he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be\\n dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I guess you\\'re right.\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about\\n old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and\\n lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn\\'t you say?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.\\n \"There\\'s one story that\\'s not superstition....\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine waited.\\n\\n\\n \"You—uh—paying anything for information?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\\n\\n\\n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I\\'d ask. Anyway—I can swear to this.\\n Nobody in this town\\'s ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\"\\nUntrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco\\n facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a\\n paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The\\n older are there in the shelves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\\n\\n\\n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle\\n these old papers carefully.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed\\n through it, muttering.\\n\\n\\n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\\n\\n\\n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,\\n adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That\\'s it,\" she\\n said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they\\'re stored in the\\n dark. But they\\'re still flimsy, mind you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front\\n page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American\\n Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.\\n Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\\n\\n\\n On page four, under a column headed\\nCounty Notes\\nhe saw the name Bram:\\n\\n\\n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,\\n north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of\\n Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a\\n few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has\\n been a resident of Mrs. Stoate\\'s Guest Home in Elsby for the past\\n months.\\n\\n\\n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\\n\\n\\n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the\\n heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to\\n her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught\\n his eye:\\n\\n\\n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much\\n alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and\\n thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine\\n woods north of Spivey\\'s farm destroyed a considerable amount of\\n timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along\\n the river.\\n\\n\\n The librarian was at Tremaine\\'s side. \"I have to close the library now.\\n You\\'ll have to come back tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\\n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in\\n windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a\\n cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\\n\\n\\n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint\\n squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward\\n of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped\\n short, stared after the car.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.\\n Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked\\n open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed\\n north after the police car.\\nTwo miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine\\n rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the\\n highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.\\n The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter? Run out of signal?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s it to you, mister?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We could be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name\\'s Tremaine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you\\'re the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted\\n chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to\\n him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike\\n before handing it to Tremaine.\\n\\n\\n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What\\'s your beef,\\n Tremaine?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave\\n the word, Grammond.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out\\n on me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were\\n doing might have been influenced if I\\'d told you about the Elsby angle.\"\\n\\n\\n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it\\n apart brick by brick in the time—\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s just what I don\\'t want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he\\'ll\\n go underground.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got it all figured, I see. I\\'m just the dumb hick you boys use\\n for the spade work, that it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pull your lip back in. You\\'ve given me the confirmation I needed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching\\n out a signal. For all I know, it\\'s forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling\\n all over the damned state. I\\'ve got fixes in every county—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs\\n three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\\n\\n\\n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You\\'re the boy with all\\n the answers. But if you get in trouble, don\\'t call me; call Washington.\"\\nBack in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\\n\\n\\n \"It looks like Grammond\\'s not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.\\n Tell him if he queers this—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back\\n over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t go dumb on me, Fred. We\\'re not dealing with West Virginia\\n moonshiners.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don\\'t try out\\n your famous temper on me. I\\'m still in charge of this investigation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. Just don\\'t get stuck in some senator\\'s hip pocket.\" Tremaine\\n hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of\\n Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat\\n and left the hotel.\\n\\n\\n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He\\n walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a\\n once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its\\n windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the\\n ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button\\n beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute\\n before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned\\n face looked at him coolly.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won\\'t remember me, but I—\"\\n\\n\\n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss\\n Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.\\n Only a faint quaver reflected her age—close to eighty, Tremaine\\n thought, startled.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the\\n furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a\\n straight chair across the room from him.\\n\\n\\n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I\\'m pleased to see\\n that you\\'ve amounted to something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just another bureaucrat, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I often wondered why you didn\\'t leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even\\n as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\\n\\n\\n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some\\n information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your\\n discretion?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\"\\nMiss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\\n used against him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'ll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\\n to be in the national interest.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not at all sure I know what the term \\'national interest\\' means,\\n James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I\\'m not out to hurt him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I\\'m not certain of the\\n year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What does he do for a living?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have no idea.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\\n piece of country? What\\'s his story?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram\\'s story.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You called him \\'Bram\\', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\\n last?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything—\"\\n\\n\\n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll\\'s faded cheek. She wiped it away\\n impatiently.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine stood up. \"I\\'m sorry. Really sorry. I didn\\'t mean to grill\\n you. Miss Carroll. You\\'ve been very kind. I had no right....\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\\n complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\\n be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\\n She paused. Tremaine waited.\\n\\n\\n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\\n him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\\n He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\\n a cave beneath his house.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\\n and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\\n twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\\n we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\\n open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\\n there alone.\\n\\n\\n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\\n to speak to me but I would not listen.\\n\\n\\n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\\n keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\\n in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\\n consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\\n He never called again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\\n silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\\n am, James.\"\\n\\n\\n \"May I see it?\"\\n\\n\\n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I\\'d like to\\n examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Carroll nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d be grateful for any lead.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\\nIII\\n\\n\\n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\\n pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\\n asked:\\n\\n\\n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine shook his head. \"I\\'m getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea\\'s a\\n dud, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn\\'t showed up yet. I\\'m getting\\n a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. Just so I\\'m back by full dark.\"\\n\\n\\n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what\\'s this about\\n State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\\n from what you were saying to me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond\\'s a jump ahead of\\n me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn\\'t want to be left out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I\\'m\\n wondering why you don\\'t want \\'em in. If there\\'s some kind of spy ring\\n working—\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re up against an unknown quantity. I don\\'t know what\\'s behind this\\n and neither does anybody else. Maybe it\\'s a ring of Bolsheviks ...\\n and maybe it\\'s something bigger. I have the feeling we\\'ve made enough\\n mistakes in the last few years; I don\\'t want to see this botched.\"\\n\\n\\n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\\n Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\\n before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\\n out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\\n door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\\n the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\\n a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\\n empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don\\'t look good,\" he\\n said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\\n\\n\\n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\\n Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\\n gun?\"\\n\\n\\n \"In the car.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Better get it.\"\\n\\n\\n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\\n rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\\n Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\\n lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\\n\\n\\n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody\\'d think he\\'d been gone a week.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not a very cozy—\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\\n distance.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil\\'s that?\"\\n Tremaine said.\\n\\n\\n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\\n light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\\n slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\\n It ended suddenly near the wall.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\\n\\n\\n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\\n stared at Tremaine. \"I\\'m too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\\n he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\\n tricks?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we\\'d better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\\n questions.\"\\nAt the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy\\n lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop\\n of greased hair.\\n\\n\\n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung\\n the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I ain\\'t done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain\\'t nothin wrong\\n with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bram\\'s a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How\\'d you find that\\n out, Hull?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s a foreigner, ain\\'t he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we\\n heard....\"\\n\\n\\n \"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re lookin for the spies.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s looking for spies?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Cops.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who says so?\"\\n\\n\\n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to\\n the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about \\'em,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn\\'t got all\\n night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called\\n me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help \\'em get\\n them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around\\n hers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\\n\\n\\n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the\\n spies was out north of town. Well, Bram\\'s a foreigner, and he\\'s out\\n that way, ain\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anything else?\"\\n\\n\\n The boy looked at his feet.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

We took our places\\n in the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that\\n nobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling\\n lost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to\\n me. He\\'s red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An\\n intelligent runt like me.\\n\\n\\n He said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get\\n together when we get down?\"\\n\\n\\n I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked\\n him. Well, I did when I wasn\\'t mad at him, but now I had that crack\\n he\\'d made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to\\n come back alive.\" It wasn\\'t fair, but it was a good crack and he went\\n back to his place without saying anything.\\n\\n\\n My name is Mia Havero. I\\'m fourteen, of course, or I wouldn\\'t be\\n telling this. I\\'m short, dark and scrawny, though I don\\'t expect that\\n scrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the\\n meantime, I\\'ve got brains as a consolation.\\n\\n\\n After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.\\n We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and\\n then we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn\\'t have to\\n leave that way, but George thinks it\\'s fun to be a hot pilot.\\n\\n\\n Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I\\'d been stinking to Jimmy D. He\\'s\\n the only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don\\'t go\\n partners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that\\n crack about being a snob.\\n\\n\\n The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact\\n the Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was\\n almost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council\\n debate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was\\n all right in the end. It didn\\'t make any practical difference to us\\n kids because they never tell you anything about the place they\\'re going\\n to drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn\\'t have known that much\\n if Daddy weren\\'t Chairman of the Council.\\n\\n\\n I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody\\n else was breaking down, so I didn\\'t. I did feel miserable. I cried when\\n I said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that\\n wasn\\'t in public.\\nIt wasn\\'t the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\\n because I never believed that I wouldn\\'t. The thought that made me\\n unhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\\n Planets make me feel wretched.\\n\\n\\n The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\\n calves ache or every time you step you think you\\'re going to trip on\\n a piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\\n and little grubby things just looking for\\nyou\\nto crawl on. If you\\n can think of anything creepier than that, you\\'ve got a real nasty\\n imagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I\\'ve\\n been on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\\n not for me.\\n\\n\\n We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it\\'s only a\\n thousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\\n a level or down a level and be back in civilization.\\n\\n\\n When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\\n sea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\\n hills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\\n don\\'t care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\\n gear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\\n smarting from the slap I\\'d given him.\\n\\n\\n In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\\n Jimmy—if he would get back alive.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\\n nearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\\n like fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\\n\\n\\n Don\\'t think I was helpless. I\\'m hell on wheels. They don\\'t let us grow\\n for fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\\n do figure, though, that if you can\\'t keep yourself alive by the time\\n you\\'re fourteen, you\\'re too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\\n the Ship. There\\'s sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\\n is a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\\n something has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\\n from decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\\n keep the population steady.\\n\\n\\n I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\\n found at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\\n Venie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\\n getting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\\n landing, I grabbed Ninc\\'s reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn\\'t\\n have anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn\\'t stand to put off the\\n bad moment any longer.\\n\\n\\n The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\\n and in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\\n color of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\\nII\\n\\n\\n The first night was hell, I guess because I\\'m not used to having the\\n lights out. That\\'s when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\\n the dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\\n if it\\'s really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in\\n thirty gone.\\n\\n\\n I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\\n things in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\\n The first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\\n I could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\\n camp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\\n though not with that meatball Jimmy D.\\n\\n\\n No, he isn\\'t really a meatball. The trouble is that I don\\'t take\\n nothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn\\'t take nothing from\\n nobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\\n\\n\\n I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to\\n Year End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\\n spring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\\n back we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\\n look forward to.\\n\\n\\n In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\\n animals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\\n good, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\\n best meat vat on the Ship. I\\'ve eaten things so gruey-looking that I\\n wondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\\n they\\'ve turned out to taste good. And I\\'ve seen things that looked good\\n that I couldn\\'t keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\\n\\n\\n On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\\n hillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\\n it in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\\n hard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\\n of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn\\'t\\n identify.\\n\\n\\n One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\\n they dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\\n actual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\\n Earth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\\n established, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\\n draft animals.\\n\\n\\n The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\\n as well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\\n else in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\\n were planted. I don\\'t know how many of those planets had animals that\\ncould\\nhave been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\\n had to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I\\'ll\\n bet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn\\'t had horses.\\nWe\\'d come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the\\n road. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\\n\\n\\n I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined\\n bend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There\\n were five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures\\n alive.\\n\\n\\n They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and\\n knobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for\\n faces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were\\n almost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They\\n made a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded\\n along.\\n\\n\\n I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the\\n men on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as\\n cats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line\\n and he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That\\n one wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\\n\\n\\n He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he\\n had a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we\\n reached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow\\n me. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can\\'t help the\\n face he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man\\n looks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That\\n was why I kept riding.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?\\n There be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\\n\\n\\n I told you I hadn\\'t finished filling out yet, but I hadn\\'t thought it\\n was that bad. I wasn\\'t ready to make a fight over the point, though.\\n Generally, I can\\'t keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn\\'t say\\n anything. It seemed smart.\\n\\n\\n \"Where be you from?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n I pointed to the road behind us.\\n\\n\\n \"And where be you going?\"\\n\\n\\n I pointed ahead. No other way to go.\\n\\n\\n He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and\\n Daddy, who should know better.\\n\\n\\n We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you\\'d\\n better ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\\n\\n\\n He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a\\n mouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether\\n everybody here spoke the same way. I\\'d never heard International\\n English spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit\\n with him.\\n\\n\\n One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they\\'d been\\n watching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\\n\\n\\n \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel\\'d even notice him at\\n all. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\\n\\n\\n The rider looked at me. When I didn\\'t dissolve in terror as he\\n expected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\\n\\n\\n The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us\\n to Forton for protection.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving\\n along and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.\\n I felt uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I don\\'t think so.\"\\n\\n\\n What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and\\n reached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\\n\\n\\n I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over\\n with the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he\\n didn\\'t want to be fried.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\\n\\n\\n They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\\n\\n\\n When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let\\'s go.\"\\n\\n\\n They didn\\'t want to move. They didn\\'t want to leave the rifles. I\\n could see that. Horst didn\\'t say anything. He just watched me with\\n narrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling\\n tones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It\\n surprised me. I didn\\'t think I sounded\\nthat\\nmean. I decided he just\\n didn\\'t trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\\n\\n\\n After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the\\n creatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get\\n them now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc\\'s sides and rode on. At the next\\n bend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and\\n the creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\\n\\n\\n I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my\\n mind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes\\n I even convince myself that I\\'m hell on wheels.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my\\n great-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,\\n nestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than\\n the last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\\n\\n\\n My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\\n\\n\\n The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave\\n way to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of\\n the green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I\\'d seen before\\n hadn\\'t seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\\n\\n\\n But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or\\n something.\\n\\n\\n I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody\\n questioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving\\n silently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I\\'ve\\n seen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\\n\\n\\n Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received\\n a jolt that sickened me.\\n\\n\\n By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were\\n cold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to\\n a gallop.\\n\\n\\n I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all\\n stone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were\\n no machines more complicated than the trucks I\\'d seen earlier. At the\\n edge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the\\n window—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\\n\\n\\n But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn\\'t\\n see one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There\\n were little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All\\n the boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why\\n Horst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn\\'t flattering; but\\n I decided I\\'d not tell anybody different until I found what made the\\n clocks tick on this planet.\\n\\n\\n But that wasn\\'t what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They\\n swarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and\\nfour\\nchildren. It was the most foul thing I\\'ve ever seen. It struck me\\n then—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I\\n closed my eyes until it passed.\\nThe first thing you learn in school is that if it weren\\'t for idiot and\\n criminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The\\n evacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people\\n wouldn\\'t have died. There wouldn\\'t have\\nbeen\\neight billion people.\\n But, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in\\n their path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth\\n had and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\\n\\n\\n I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough\\n foresight to see what was coming. If it hadn\\'t been for them and some\\n others like them, there wouldn\\'t be any humans left anywhere. And I\\n wouldn\\'t be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\\n\\n\\n What happened before, when people didn\\'t use their heads and wound up\\n blowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The\\n older people don\\'t let us forget. But these people had, and that the\\n Council should know.\\n\\n\\n For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt\\nreally\\nfrightened. There was too much going on that I didn\\'t understand. I\\n felt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I\\n whomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\\n\\n\\n I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk\\n again. I couldn\\'t help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he\\'s\\n smart and brains I needed.\\n\\n\\n How do you find out what\\'s going on? Eavesdrop? That\\'s a lousy method.\\n For one thing, people can\\'t be depended on to talk about the things you\\n want to hear. For another, you\\'re likely to get caught. Ask somebody?\\n Who? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind\\n up with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think\\n of was to find a library, but that might be a job.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren\\'t the last. In the\\n late afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was\\n starting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the\\n sky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what\\n had gone wrong.\\n\\n\\n I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.\\n The scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to\\n drop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin\\'s style. I\\n triggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn\\'t\\n know why he was back, but I wasn\\'t really sorry.\\n\\n\\n The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\\n head, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\\n bucking so hard that I knew this wasn\\'t hot piloting at all, just plain\\n idiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\\n overhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn\\'t one of ours.\\n Not too different, but not ours.\\nOne more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and\\n we wouldn\\'t tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that\\n takes an advanced technology to build.\\nI felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to\\n a campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn\\'t\\n help but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent\\n buildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more\\n than a high-walled pen. It didn\\'t even have a roof.\\n\\n\\n I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,\\n his wife and their three children. The kids were running around and\\n playing, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father\\n came and pulled him away.\\n\\n\\n The kids weren\\'t to blame for their parents, but when one of them said\\n hello to me, I didn\\'t even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I\\n had two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn\\'t strike me until\\n that moment that it wouldn\\'t even seem out of the ordinary to these\\n kids. Isn\\'t that horrible?\\n\\n\\n About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man\\n I had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He\\n had white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never\\n seen before.\\n\\n\\n When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered\\n around. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the\\n children tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren\\'t ready to go,\\n so the old man started telling them a story. In the old man\\'s odd\\n accent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,\\n it seemed just right.\\n\\n\\n It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in\\n a house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a\\n nice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony\\n errand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the\\n poor girl\\'s position. All the little girl had to help her were the\\n handkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her\\n dear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to\\n defeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\\n\\n\\n I wished for the same for myself.\\n\\n\\n The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids\\n off to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the\\n camp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I\\n couldn\\'t see far into the dark.\\n\\n\\n A voice there said, \"I\\'ll be damned if I\\'ll take another day like this\\n one, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we\\'re\\n not.\"\\n\\n\\n Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the\\n campfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the\\n fire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets\\n and mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now\\n what they used the high-walled pen for.\\n\\n\\n I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the\\n night. I should have used my head. I hadn\\'t and now it was time to take\\n leave.\\n\\n\\n I never got the chance.\\nI was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my\\n shoulder and I was swung around.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one\\n who\\'d made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He\\n was alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.\\n\\n\\n I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he\\n went down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him\\n and reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from\\n behind and pinned my arms to my side.\\n\\n\\n I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly\\n hand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a\\n lungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I\\'m told—but he\\n didn\\'t let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet\\n and dragged me off.\\n\\n\\n When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped\\n dragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and\\n I\\'ll hurt you.\"\\n\\n\\n That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he\\'d\\n threatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things\\n to do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight\\n for that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n The one I\\'d dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting\\n the animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid\\'s gear, bring the horse and what\\n we can use.\"\\n\\n\\n The other one didn\\'t move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing\\n tone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally\\n backed down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn\\'t so much objecting to me\\n being kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his\\n bunch.\\n\\n\\n But I wasn\\'t done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under\\n my jacket.\\n\\n\\n Horst turned back to me and I said, \"You can\\'t do this and get away\\n with it.\"\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of\\n trouble. So don\\'t give me a hard time.\"\\n\\n\\n He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I\\n didn\\'t like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\\n\\n\\n \"The courts won\\'t let you get away with this,\" I said. I\\'d passed\\n a courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL\\n JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or\\n something stuffy like that.\\n\\n\\n He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I\\n knew I\\'d goofed.\\n\\n\\n \"Boy, boy. Don\\'t talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I be\\n taking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to\\n court and they\\'ll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving\\n you your freedom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why would they be doing that?\" I asked. I slipped my hand under my\\n jacket.\\n\\n\\n \"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the\\n Ships,\" Horst said. \"That be enough. They already have one of you brats\\n in jail in Forton.\"\\n\\n\\n I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with\\n all my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"The kid\\'s got some good equipment. But I can\\'t make out what\\n this be for.\" He held out my pickup signal.\\n\\n\\n Horst looked at it, then handed it back. \"Throw it away,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I leveled my gun at them—Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, \"Hand\\n that over to me.\"\\n\\n\\n Horst made a disgusted sound.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t make any noise,\" I said, \"or you\\'ll fry. Now hand it over.\"\\n\\n\\n I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the\\n saddle. \"What\\'s the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\"\\n\\n\\n I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind\\n and the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good\\n enough,\" to the others who\\'d come up behind me.\\n\\n\\n I felt like a fool.\\n\\n\\n Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and\\n said in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was\\n natural and mine wasn\\'t, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it\\n until it cracked and fell apart.\\n\\n\\n Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard\\n that my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\\n\\n\\n I said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\\n\\n\\n It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can\\n remember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my\\n face and then nothing.\\n\\n\\n Brains are no good if you don\\'t use them.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

What was behind the coup d\\'etat that put\\n the present government in power?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure I haven\\'t pried into—\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this\\n way about ten years back?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we\\navoid\\nwith the\\n Groaci. I certainly hope you\\'re not thinking of openly intruding—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don\\'t welcome outworlders\\n raking up things. They\\'ve been gracious enough to let us live down\\n the fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\\n occasion.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\\n grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try\\n never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I\\'ll be back before\\n you close the office.\" Miss Meuhl\\'s face was set in lines of grim\\n disapproval as he closed the door.\\nThe pale-featured Groacian vibrated his throat-bladder in a distressed\\n bleat.\\n\\n\\n \"Not to enter the Archives,\" he said in his faint voice. \"The denial of\\n permission. The deep regret of the Archivist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The importance of my task here,\" Retief said, enunciating the glottal\\n dialect with difficulty. \"My interest in local history.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The necessity that I enter.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The specific instructions of the Archivist.\" The Groacian\\'s voice rose\\n to a whisper. \"To insist no longer. To give up this idea!\"\\n\\n\\n \"OK, Skinny, I know when I\\'m licked,\" Retief said in Terran. \"To keep\\n your nose clean.\"\\n\\n\\n Outside, Retief stood for a moment looking across at the deeply carved\\n windowless stucco facades lining the street, then started off in the\\n direction of the Terrestrial Consulate General. The few Groacians on\\n the street eyed him furtively, veered to avoid him as he passed. Flimsy\\n high-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement.\\n The air was clean and cool.\\n\\n\\n At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of\\n complaints.\\n\\n\\n Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street.\\n An elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the\\n Groacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in.\\n\\n\\n A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from\\n the bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in\\n mid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot.\\n\\n\\n \"To enjoy a cooling drink,\" Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at\\n the edge of the pit. \"To sample a true Groacian beverage.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To not enjoy my poor offerings,\" the Groacian mumbled. \"A pain in the\\n digestive sacs; to express regret.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To not worry,\" Retief said, irritated. \"To pour it out and let me\\n decide whether I like it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To be grappled in by peace-keepers for poisoning of—foreigners.\" The\\n barkeep looked around for support, found none. The Groaci customers,\\n eyes elsewhere, were drifting away.\\n\\n\\n \"To get the lead out,\" Retief said, placing a thick gold-piece in the\\n dish provided. \"To shake a tentacle.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The procuring of a cage,\" a thin voice called from the sidelines. \"The\\n displaying of a freak.\"\\nRetief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture\\n of contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the\\n creature was drunk.\\n\\n\\n \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes\\n toward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk\\n whispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered\\n toward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly.\\n\\n\\n \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The\\n barkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,\\n took his arms and helped him to the door.\\n\\n\\n \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own\\n stinking place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful\\n as hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the\\n door. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked\\n at the weaving alien.\\n\\n\\n \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered.\\n\\n\\n \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum\\n with you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"To have a drink together—\"\\n\\n\\n \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief.\\n Retief backed away.\\n\\n\\n \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy—\"\\n\\n\\n The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,\\n head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow\\n crossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,\\n who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow\\n alley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following\\n Groacian.\\n\\n\\n Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian\\n fell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;\\n Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed.\\n\\n\\n \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay\\n right here and have a nice long talk.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There\\n are two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his\\n cape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign\\n Ministry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don\\'t mind telling\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure you don\\'t. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\"\\n\\n\\n Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments\\n indicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a\\n courteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.\\n\\n\\n \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\\n Consul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present\\n Shluh, of the Internal Police?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said. They resumed their seats. Miss\\n Meuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, it\\'s such a pleasure—\" she began.\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn\\'t come here to\\n sip tea today.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,\\n Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police\\n chief.\\n\\n\\n \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought\\n to hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this\\n individual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a\\n foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department\\n indicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of\\n the Terrestrial Consul.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.\\n\\n\\n \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a\\n Terrestrial cruiser, the\\nISV Terrific\\n, which dropped from sight in\\n this sector nine years ago?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll not be a party—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll do as you\\'re told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I\\'m\\n telling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl sat down.\\n\\n\\n Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound,\\n Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial\\n hands—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but\\n it hits a sour note with me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible\\n episode! And you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac\\n and sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny\\n answers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.\\n Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe—at the most. If they were\\n innocent.\"\\n\\n\\n \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out.\\n\\n\\n \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest\\n your—\"\\n\"Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don\\'t\\n think your story will be good enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you admit—\"\\n\\n\\n \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\\n\\n\\n \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for\\n your diplomatic immunity, I should do more—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force\\n paid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial\\n diplomatic mission.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\\n \"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It\\n has outdone itself—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief\\n said. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you\\'ve\\n visaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the\\n diplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or\\n your satellite—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Fith\\'s mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of\\n this matter—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll talk to me, or there\\'ll be a task force here in five days to do\\n the talking,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\\n\\n\\n Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The\\n Groaci sat down.\\n\\n\\n \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years\\n back—about nine, I think—there was a little parade held here. Some\\n curious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,\\n they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the\\n streets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.\\n\\n\\n \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to\\n communicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the\\n parade was over?\"\\nFith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\\n retracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\\n mouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\\n\\n\\n \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\\n throats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\\n out for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\\n yell....\"\\n\\n\\n \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\\n once.\"\\n\\n\\n \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\\n narco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\\n parade.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\\n was no killing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re alive?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\\n foods—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\\n more information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?\\n What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they \\'fall ill\\' before the\\n big parade?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\\n Terrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were\\n strange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Guns? No, no guns—\"\\n\\n\\n \"They raised their hands, didn\\'t they? Asked for help. You helped them;\\n helped them to death.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\\n\\n\\n \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\\n for them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn\\'t it? I\\'ll bet you had a\\n brisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\\n call, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\\n strange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\\n felt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\\n came, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our\\n guilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our\\n friendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made\\n a blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make\\n amends....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where is the ship?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The ship?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget.\\n Where is it?\"\\n\\n\\n The two Groacians exchanged looks.\\n\\n\\n \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the\\n ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don\\'t come back in a reasonable length\\n of time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He\\n stood, looked at the Groaci.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go,\" he said.\\nRetief stooped under the heavy timbers shoring the entry to the cavern.\\n He peered into the gloom at the curving flank of the space-burned hull.\\n\\n\\n \"Any lights in here?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n A Groacian threw a switch. A weak bluish glow sprang up.\\n\\n\\n Retief walked along the raised wooden catwalk, studying the ship. Empty\\n emplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was\\n visible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words \\'IVS\\n Terrific B7 New Terra\\' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy.\\n\\n\\n \"How did you get it in here?\" Retief asked.\\n\\n\\n \"It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,\"\\n Fith said, his voice thinner than ever. \"This is a natural crevasse.\\n The vessel was lowered into it and roofed over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How did you shield it so the detectors didn\\'t pick it up?\"\\n\\n\\n \"All here is high-grade iron ore,\" Fith said, waving a member. \"Great\\n veins of almost pure metal.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief grunted. \"Let\\'s go inside.\"\\n\\n\\n Shluh came forward with a hand-lamp. The party entered the ship.\\n\\n\\n Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior\\n of the control compartment. Dust was thick on the deck, the stanchions\\n where acceleration couches had been mounted, the empty instrument\\n panels, the litter of sheared bolts, scraps of wire and paper. A thin\\n frosting of rust dulled the exposed metal where cutting torches had\\n sliced away heavy shielding. There was a faint odor of stale bedding.\\n\\n\\n \"The cargo compartment—\" Shluh began.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve seen enough,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n Silently, the Groacians led the way back out through the tunnel and\\n into the late afternoon sunshine. As they climbed the slope to the\\n steam car, Fith came to Retief\\'s side.\\n\\n\\n \"Indeed, I hope that this will be the end of this unfortunate affair,\"\\n he said. \"Now that all has been fully and honestly shown—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can skip all that,\" Retief said. \"You\\'re nine years late. The\\n crew was still alive when the task force called, I imagine. You killed\\n them—or let them die—rather than take the chance of admitting what\\n you\\'d done.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We were at fault,\" Fith said abjectly. \"Now we wish only friendship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The\\nTerrific\\nwas a heavy cruiser, about twenty thousand tons.\"\\n Retief looked grimly at the slender Foreign Office official. \"Where is\\n she, Fith? I won\\'t settle for a hundred-ton lifeboat.\"\\nFith erected his eye stalks so violently that one eye-shield fell off.\\n\\n\\n \"I know nothing of ... of....\" He stopped. His throat vibrated rapidly\\n as he struggled for calm.\\n\\n\\n \"My government can entertain no further accusations, Mr. Consul,\"\\n he said at last. \"I have been completely candid with you, I have\\n overlooked your probing into matters not properly within your sphere of\\n responsibility. My patience is at an end.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where is that ship?\" Retief rapped out. \"You never learn, do you?\\n You\\'re still convinced you can hide the whole thing and forget it. I\\'m\\n telling you you can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We return to the city now,\" Fith said. \"I can do no more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can and you will, Fith,\" Retief said. \"I intend to get to the\\n truth of this matter.\"\\n\\n\\n Fith spoke to Shluh in rapid Groacian. The police chief gestured to his\\n four armed constables. They moved to ring Retief in.\\n\\n\\n Retief eyed Fith. \"Don\\'t try it,\" he said. \"You\\'ll just get yourself in\\n deeper.\"\\n\\n\\n Fith clacked his mandibles angrily, eye stalks canted aggressively\\n toward the Terrestrial.\\n\\n\\n \"Out of deference to your diplomatic status, Terrestrial, I shall\\n ignore your insulting remarks,\" Fith said in his reedy voice. \"Let us\\n now return to the city.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at the four policemen. \"I see your point,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Fith followed him into the car, sat rigidly at the far end of the seat.\\n\\n\\n \"I advise you to remain very close to your consulate,\" Fith said. \"I\\n advise you to dismiss these fancies from your mind, and to enjoy the\\n cultural aspects of life at Groac. Especially, I should not venture out\\n of the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to\\n the Groacian government.\"\\n\\n\\n In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung\\n vehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to\\n the rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, \"I want you to listen carefully to what I\\'m\\n going to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off\\n guard.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about,\" Miss Meuhl snapped,\\n her eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses.\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'ll listen, you may find out,\" Retief said. \"I have no time\\n to waste, Miss Meuhl. They won\\'t be expecting an immediate move—I\\n hope—and that may give me the latitude I need.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re still determined to make an issue of that incident!\" Miss\\n Meuhl snorted. \"I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a\\n sophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it\\'s not what\\n happened nine years ago I\\'m concerned with. It\\'s what\\'s happening now.\\n I\\'ve told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out.\\n Don\\'t you understand the implication? That vessel couldn\\'t have come\\n far. The cruiser itself must be somewhere near by. I want to know\\n where!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Groaci don\\'t know. They\\'re a very cultured, gentle people. You can\\n do irreparable harm to the reputation of Terrestrials if you insist—\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s my decision,\" Retief said. \"I have a job to do and we\\'re\\n wasting time.\" He crossed the room to his desk, opened a drawer and\\n took out a slim-barreled needler.\\n\\n\\n \"This office is being watched. Not very efficiently, if I know the\\n Groaci. I think I can get past them all right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you going with ... that?\" Miss Meuhl stared at the needler.\\n \"What in the world—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Groaci won\\'t waste any time destroying every piece of paper in\\n their files relating to this thing. I have to get what I need before\\n it\\'s too late. If I wait for an official Inquiry Commission, they\\'ll\\n find nothing but blank smiles.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re out of your mind!\" Miss Meuhl stood up, quivering with\\n indignation. \"You\\'re like a ... a....\"\\n\\n\\n \"You and I are in a tight spot, Miss Meuhl. The logical next move for\\n the Groaci is to dispose of both of us. We\\'re the only ones who know\\n what happened. Fith almost did the job this afternoon, but I bluffed\\n him out—for the moment.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl emitted a shrill laugh. \"Your fantasies are getting the\\n better of you,\" she gasped. \"In danger, indeed! Disposing of me! I\\'ve\\n never heard anything so ridiculous.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stay in this office. Close and safe-lock the door. You\\'ve got food and\\n water in the dispenser. I suggest you stock up, before they shut the\\n supply down. Don\\'t let anyone in, on any pretext whatever. I\\'ll keep in\\n touch with you via hand-phone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you planning to do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I don\\'t make it back here, transmit the sealed record of this\\n afternoon\\'s conversation, along with the information I\\'ve given you.\\n Beam it through on a mayday priority. Then tell the Groaci what you\\'ve\\n done and sit tight. I think you\\'ll be all right. It won\\'t be easy to\\n blast in here and anyway, they won\\'t make things worse by killing you.\\n A force can be here in a week.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll do nothing of the sort! The Groaci are very fond of me! You ...\\n Johnny-come-lately! Roughneck! Setting out to destroy—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Blame it on me if it will make you feel any better,\" Retief said, \"but\\n don\\'t be fool enough to trust them.\" He pulled on a cape, opened the\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be back in a couple of hours,\" he said. Miss Meuhl stared after\\n him silently as he closed the door.\\nIt was an hour before dawn when Retief keyed the combination to the\\n safe-lock and stepped into the darkened consular office. He looked\\n tired.\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl, dozing in a chair, awoke with a start. She looked at\\n Retief, rose and snapped on a light, turned to stare.\\n\\n\\n \"What in the world—Where have you been? What\\'s happened to your\\n clothing?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got a little dirty. Don\\'t worry about it.\" Retief went to his desk,\\n opened a drawer and replaced the needler.\\n\\n\\n \"Where have you been?\" Miss Meuhl demanded. \"I stayed here—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m glad you did,\" Retief said. \"I hope you piled up a supply of food\\n and water from the dispenser, too. We\\'ll be holed up here for a week,\\n at least.\" He jotted figures on a pad. \"Warm up the official sender. I\\n have a long transmission for Regional Headquarters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell me where you\\'ve been?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have a message to get off first, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said sharply.\\n \"I\\'ve been to the Foreign Ministry,\" he added. \"I\\'ll tell you all about\\n it later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At this hour? There\\'s no one there....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Meuhl gasped. \"You mean you broke in? You burgled the Foreign\\n Office?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Retief said calmly. \"Now—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is absolutely the end!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"Thank heaven I\\'ve\\n already—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get that sender going, woman!\" Retief snapped. \"This is important.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve already done so, Mr. Retief!\" Miss Meuhl said harshly. \"I\\'ve been\\n waiting for you to come back here....\" She turned to the communicator,\\n flipped levers. The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance\\n image appeared.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s here now,\" Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief\\n triumphantly.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s good,\" Retief said. \"I don\\'t think the Groaci can knock us off\\n the air, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"I made a full\\n report to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this\\n office. Any doubts I may have had as to the rightness of that decision\\n have been completely dispelled by what you\\'ve just told me.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at her levelly. \"You\\'ve been a busy girl, Miss Meuhl. Did\\n you mention the six Terrestrials who were killed here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That had no bearing on the matter of your wild behavior! I must say,\\n in all my years in the Corps, I\\'ve never encountered a personality less\\n suited to diplomatic work.\"\\nThe screen crackled, the ten-second transmission lag having elapsed.\\n \"Mr. Retief,\" the face on the screen said, \"I am Counsellor Pardy,\\n DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region. I have received a\\n report on your conduct which makes it mandatory for me to relieve you\\n administratively, vice Miss Yolanda Meuhl, DAO-9. Pending the findings\\n of a Board of Inquiry, you will—\"\\n\\n\\n Retief reached out and snapped off the communicator. The triumphant\\n look faded from Miss Meuhl\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, what is the meaning—\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I\\'d listened any longer, I might have heard something I couldn\\'t\\n ignore. I can\\'t afford that, at this moment. Listen, Miss Meuhl,\"\\n Retief went on earnestly, \"I\\'ve found the missing cruiser.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You heard him relieve you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I heard him say he was\\ngoing\\nto, Miss Meuhl. But until I\\'ve heard\\n and acknowledged a verbal order, it has no force. If I\\'m wrong, he\\'ll\\n get my resignation. If I\\'m right, that suspension would be embarrassing\\n all around.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re defying lawful authority! I\\'m in charge here now.\" Miss Meuhl\\n stepped to the local communicator.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to report this terrible thing to the Groaci at once, and\\n offer my profound—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t touch that screen,\" Retief said. \"You go sit in that corner\\n where I can keep an eye on you. I\\'m going to make a sealed tape for\\n transmission to Headquarters, along with a call for an armed task\\n force. Then we\\'ll settle down to wait.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief ignored Miss Meuhl\\'s fury as he spoke into the recorder.\\n\\n\\n The local communicator chimed. Miss Meuhl jumped up, staring at it.\\n\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" Retief said. \"Answer it.\"\\n\\n\\n A Groacian official appeared on the screen.\\n\\n\\n \"Yolanda Meuhl,\" he said without preamble, \"for the Foreign Minister of\\n the Groacian Autonomy, I herewith accredit you as Terrestrial Consul\\n to Groac, in accordance with the advices transmitted to my government\\n direct from the Terrestrial Headquarters. As consul, you are requested\\n to make available for questioning Mr. J. Retief, former consul, in\\n connection with the assault on two peace keepers and illegal entry into\\n the offices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, why,\" Miss Meuhl stammered. \"Yes, of course. And I do want to\\n express my deepest regrets—\"\\nRetief rose, went to the communicator, assisted Miss Meuhl aside.\\n\\n\\n \"Listen carefully, Fith,\" he said. \"Your bluff has been called. You\\n don\\'t come in and we don\\'t come out. Your camouflage worked for nine\\n years, but it\\'s all over now. I suggest you keep your heads and resist\\n the temptation to make matters worse than they are.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Fith said, \"a peace squad waits outside your consulate.\\n It is clear you are in the hands of a dangerous lunatic. As always, the\\n Groaci wish only friendship with the Terrestrials, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bother,\" Retief said. \"You know what was in those files I looked\\n over this morning.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief turned at a sound behind him. Miss Meuhl was at the door,\\n reaching for the safe-lock release....\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t!\" Retief jumped—too late.\\n\\n\\n The door burst inward. A crowd of crested Groaci pressed into the room,\\n pushed Miss Meuhl back, aimed scatter guns at Retief. Police Chief\\n Shluh pushed forward.\\n\\n\\n \"Attempt no violence, Terrestrial,\" he said. \"I cannot promise to\\n restrain my men.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re violating Terrestrial territory, Shluh,\" Retief said steadily.\\n \"I suggest you move back out the same way you came in.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I invited them here,\" Miss Meuhl spoke up. \"They are here at my\\n express wish.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are they? Are you sure you meant to go this far, Miss Meuhl? A squad\\n of armed Groaci in the consulate?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are the consul, Miss Yolanda Meuhl,\" Shluh said. \"Would it not be\\n best if we removed this deranged person to a place of safety?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re making a serious mistake, Shluh,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"You\\'re quite right, Mr. Shluh. Please escort\\n Mr. Retief to his quarters in this building—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t advise you to violate my diplomatic immunity, Fith,\" Retief\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \"As chief of mission,\" Miss Meuhl said quickly, \"I hereby waive\\n immunity in the case of Mr. Retief.\"\\n\\n\\n Shluh produced a hand recorder. \"Kindly repeat your statement, Madam,\\n officially,\" he said. \"I wish no question to arise later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be a fool, woman,\" Retief said. \"Don\\'t you see what you\\'re\\n letting yourself in for? This would be a hell of a good time for you to\\n figure out whose side you\\'re on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m on the side of common decency!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been taken in. These people are concealing—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You think all women are fools, don\\'t you, Mr. Retief?\" She turned to\\n the police chief and spoke into the microphone he held up.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s an illegal waiver,\" Retief said. \"I\\'m consul here, whatever\\n rumors you\\'ve heard. This thing\\'s coming out into the open, whatever\\n you do. Don\\'t add violation of the Consulate to the list of Groacian\\n atrocities.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take the man,\" Shluh said.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

She lay quietly in the\\n other bed, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was blonde to\\n perfection, exquisitely shaped, and the rich promise of her body was\\n exposed to his view.\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\" he thought as he looked at her. \"Why did it have to happen like\\n this?\"\\n\\n\\n The whole thing was still like a dream to him, and as yet he couldn\\'t\\n decide whether it was a good or a bad dream. A year ago she had been\\n unattainable, a face to conjure with in erotic dreams, far beyond his\\n ken. A year ago she had been a public idol, the most popular actress of\\n the day. And he had been a nobody, full of a nobody\\'s idle hopes and\\n schemes.\\n\\n\\n And now he was lying in the bed next to hers in her swank Manhattan\\n apartment in the most exclusive hotel in town. The unrealness of the\\n situation overwhelmed him. His mind was a picture of confused thoughts.\\n Meanings and answers to his questions slithered out of his reach.\\n\\n\\n \"God,\" he said. It was not an exclamation, nor yet an expletive. It was\\n a mere statement of fact.\\n\\n\\n A thought teased at him. Charles looked at the woman again and decided\\n that she still looked beautiful in spite of the harshness of the\\n room\\'s lighting. He touched buttons by the edge of the bed and the\\n illumination quieted to a soft glow, wrapping her in a radiant halo.\\n Charles smiled wanly and got up. He stood by the bed looking at her.\\n\\n\\n \"I could have fallen in love with you once. A year ago, perhaps, or\\n longer. But not now. Not now.\" He turned away and walked to the window.\\n \"Now the world is dead. The whole world is dead.\"\\n\\n\\n New York lay quietly below him. It was the hour of indecision when\\n day has not quite made up its mind to leave and night has not yet\\n attacked in force. The streetlights were already on, making geometric\\n patterns through the dusk of Central Park. Some of the billboards were\\n shining, their relays activated by darkness-sensitized solenoids. A\\n reddish-orange pallor hung from the sky.\\n\\n\\n It had been very pleasant that afternoon. She had given of herself\\n freely, warmly, and Charles had accepted. But then he had known\\n that she would. It was not him, it was the circumstances. Under the\\n circumstances, she would have given herself to any man—\\n\\n\\n \"Why did it have to be her—or me? Why should it have to happen to\\n anybody! Why!\"\\nShe would have given herself to any man—\\nHis thoughts beat a rapid crescendo, activating emotions, stimulating\\n sensations of angry rage. He wanted to cry, to weep angry tears of\\n protest.\\n\\n\\n To any man, WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST MAN ON EARTH!\\n\\n\\n Charles picked up a heavy book end off the table and crashed it through\\n the thick pane of window glass.\\n\\n\\n A gust of wind from the outside breezed through the shattered opening,\\n attacking his olfactory patch with the retching smell of decaying\\n flesh. Charles ignored it. Even smells had lost their customary\\n meanings.\\n\\n\\n He felt the rage build up inside again, tearing at his viscera. His\\n stomach clenched up like an angry fist.\\n\\n\\n \"But I don\\'t want to be the last man alive!\" he shouted. \"I don\\'t know\\n what to do! I don\\'t know where to go, how to act! I just don\\'t know—\"\\n\\n\\n A paroxysm of sobbing shook his body. Trembling, he dropped to his\\n knees, his head against the cold firmness of the sill, his hands\\n clutched tightly around the jagged edges of the window pane. In spite\\n of the sharp pain that raced through his system, in spite of the\\n bright, warm, red stream that trickled down his face, he knelt by the\\n window for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMaybe I\\'m not the last!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n The thought struck him with suddenness, promisingly, edged with\\n swelling comfort to fill his emptiness.\\n\\n\\n Charles got up slowly, noticing for the first time that his fingers\\n were badly cut. He wrapped a handkerchief around them and forgot them.\\n He had to know—he had to find out.\\nAs he turned to leave, he noticed again the woman lying in radiant\\n state upon the bed. He walked to her side and leaned over, kissing her\\n gently on the forehead. As he straightened up, his leg caught against\\n her arm, pushing it slightly. The woman\\'s arm slipped from its position\\n and dangled from the edge of the bed like a crazy pendulum. Charles\\n picked it up and folded it across her now cold breasts. He started\\n to pull the sheet over her nude form, then stopped, smiling at his\\n conventionality. After all, it didn\\'t make any difference now.\\n\\n\\n The phonograph was near the door. On sudden impulse he switched it\\n on, turned the volume up full, and in grim jest left it playing\\n Rachmaninoff\\'s\\nIsle of the Dead\\non full automatic. The music haunted\\n him down the hall to the elevator that he had to run himself.\\n\\n\\n The lobby was littered with debris, human and otherwise. Charles\\n ignored it. The street that led towards the Bureau of Vital Statistics\\n was a mess of desolate carnage. Charles overlooked it. Shop fronts\\n smashed, stores looted, gyro-cars wrecked, proud buildings defaced.\\n\\n\\n \"That was it,\" he said to himself. \"Pride. We called this the \\'Proud\\n Era.\\' Everything was better and bigger and nicer to have. Buildings\\n were taller, men were healthier, most of the problems of humanity\\n seemed licked, or nearly so. It was a time of free power, each small\\n unit of population, each section of town operating on perpetual,\\n ever-lasting, automatic atomic piles.\\n\\n\\n \"We were free. We seemed, almost, to have accomplished something. The\\n world was running well. No wonder we called it the \\'Proud Era.\\' Life\\n was fun, just a bowl of cherries, until....\"\\n\\n\\n Two years ago the animals had started dying. Strangely enough the\\n rats had gone first, to anybody\\'s notice. Sales of poison dropped,\\n scientific laboratories chained to a perpetual rodent-cycle began to\\n complain bitterly.\\n\\n\\n Then the lovers who hunted out and haunted the lonely lanes through the\\n countryside began to remark that the locusts were late that year. The\\n Southern states joyously reported that mosquito control was working to\\n an unprecedented degree. The largest cotton crop ever was forecast and\\n rumors from Mexico had it that no one had died from scorpion bite in\\n several weeks.\\n\\n\\n A month later the meat animals, the birds and the household pets\\n began dropping as rapidly as the flies which had dropped earlier.\\n Congress was called into special session, as were all of the national\\n governments around the world. The U.N. met at emergency sessions to\\n cope with the situation. The president of the world-wide Society for\\n the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals committed suicide.\\n\\n\\n Within a year it was obvious to everyone that man was the only animal\\n left on earth.\\n\\n\\n The panic which had begun with the death of the animals was quieted\\n somewhat by the fact that humans seemed immune to the pandemic. But the\\n lakes full of dead fish caused a great stink and residents along the\\n coasts began to move inland. Sales of perfumes and deodorants soared.\\n\\n\\n Then just one year ago, the first human became infected with the\\n strange malady. Within six months, half of the world\\'s population was\\n gone. Less than a month ago no more than a few thousand people remained\\n in New York. And now....\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got to find out,\" Charles told himself. He meant it, of course,\\n but in a sense he was afraid—afraid that his trip to the Bureau might\\n give him an answer he didn\\'t dare listen to. \"But I\\'ve got to try.\" He\\n walked on down the bloody street.\\n\\n\\n Before the plague the Bureau of Vital Statistics had been one of man\\'s\\n crowning achievements. Housed as it was in a huge metallic globe of\\n a building, it contained computers which kept exact account of every\\n human on earth.\\n\\n\\n Compulsory registration and the classification of each individual by\\n means of the discrete patterns of his brain waves had accomplished for\\n man what no ordinary census could have. The machine knew who was alive,\\n who was dead, and where everybody was.\\n\\n\\n Once a year the Bureau issued The Index, an exact accounting of Earth\\'s\\n four billion inhabitants. Four billion names and addresses, compressed\\n into microprint, a tremendous achievement even for the \"Proud Era.\"\\n In all of his life, Charles had never once glanced at The Index.\\n The average person had little necessity to do so since the Bureau\\n information service would answer questions free of charge at any time.\\n\\n\\n Reaching the gigantic building, Charles pushed aside the body of a\\n young man and walked into the main foyer. Passing behind once-guarded\\n doors, he entered the giant computer room and paused in admiration.\\nOnly once, before the plague, had he seen the interior of this room.\\n But he still remembered it and he still recalled the powerful emotional\\n experience it had been those many years ago.\\n\\n\\n All children had to have a brain-wave recording made by the Bureau\\n during the first month of their life. And again at the age of 10 each\\n child returned to the Bureau for a recheck. It was for this latter\\n recording that Charles had come to the Bureau some twenty-two years\\n before and a friendly guard had let him peep briefly into the computer\\n room. The impression of intense activity, of organized confusion, of\\n mechanical wonder had remained with him the rest of his life.\\n\\n\\n \"So different now,\" he thought, surveying the room. \"Now it\\'s empty, so\\n empty.\" The machine seemed to reflect the stillness, the very deadness\\n of the world. The silence became unbearable.\\n\\n\\n Charles walked to the master control panel. With newly acquired\\n dexterity he switched the computer screens on and watched them glow\\n to life. All around the world sensitive receiving stations pulsed to\\n activity, sending out searching fingers, hunting for elusive patterns\\n of neutral energy, mapping and tabulating the results.\\n\\n\\n The main computer screen dominated one wall of the room. Other smaller\\n screens clustered around it. On these screens could be graphed the\\n population of any and every part of the globe. An illuminated counter\\n immediately above it would give the numerical strength of the area\\n being sampled while the screen would show population density by\\n individual pinpoints of light that merged to form brightness patterns.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll try New York first,\" he said to himself, knowing that he was a\\n coward, afraid to check the whole world from the start. \"I\\'ll start\\n with New York and work up.\"\\n\\n\\n Charles activated the switches that would flash a schematic map of New\\n York on the screen. \"There\\'s bound to be somebody else left here. After\\n all, there were at least twenty of us just a couple of days ago.\" And\\n one of them, a beautiful woman, had invited him up to her apartment,\\n not because she liked him, but because....\\n\\n\\n The main screen focused itself, the patterns shifting into a\\n recognizable perceptual image.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, it was just yesterday \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mor was it the day before?\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m that ten of\\n us, at least, met here to check the figures. There were lots of us\\n alive then.\" Including the blond young woman who had died just this\\n afternoon....\\n\\n\\n Charles stopped talking and forced his eyes upwards. Peripheral vision\\n caught first the vague outlines of the lower part of the map. His eyes\\n continued to move, slowly, reluctantly. They caught the over-all relief\\n of Greater New York City—and then concentrated on the single, shining\\n dot at the very heart of the map—and he understood.\\n\\n\\n His eyes stabbed quickly for the counter above the screen.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n He gasped.\\n\\n\\n The counter read\\none\\n.\\n\\n\\n Charles was by himself, the last person alive in all of New York City.\\n\\n\\n He began to tremble violently. The silence of the room began to press\\n quickly in on him. His frantic fingers searched for the computer\\n controls.\\n\\n\\n New York State. One.\\n\\n\\n The entire United States. One.\\n\\n\\n The western hemisphere, including islands.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mWas that a point of light in Brazil? No. Just a ghost image\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n The Pacific area, Asia, Australia, Asia Minor, Russia and the Near\\n East, Africa and then Europe.\\n\\n\\n England!\\n\\n\\n There was a light in England! Someone else still lived! The counter\\n clicked forward.\\n\\n\\n Two!\\n\\n\\n His trembling stopped. He breathed again.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. London was at least as populous as New York City before the\\n plague. It\\'s only logical that—\"\\n\\n\\n He stopped. For even as he spoke, the light winked out! The counter\\n clicked again.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n Alone.\\n\\n\\n Alone!\\n\\n\\n Charles screamed.\\n\\n\\n The bottom dropped out from under him!\\nWhy?\\n\\n\\n Such a simple question, but in those three letters lay the essence of\\n human nature. Why. The drive of curiosity. Stronger, in a way, than\\n the so-called \"basic\" drives: hunger, thirst, sex, shelter, warmth,\\n companionship, elimination. Certainly more decisive in the history of\\n the race. Man began to think, to differentiate himself from the other\\n animals, when he first asked the question: \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n But thinking about \"why\" didn\\'t answer the question itself, Charles\\n thought. He looked around him. He was sitting on a bench in Central\\n Park, alone except for a few stray corpses. But the park was fairly\\n free of bodies.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got about ten minutes warning,\" he said to himself. \"I guess\\n that most people wanted to die inside of something—inside of anything.\\n Not out in the unprotected open.\"\\n\\n\\n The silence was like a weight hanging around his neck. Not an insect\\n noise, not the chirp of a bird, not the sound of a car nor the scream\\n of a plane. Not even a breeze to whisper among the leaves, he thought.\\n Civilization equals life equals noise. Silence equals....\\n\\n\\n Why. His mind kept returning to the question. Of all the people on\\n earth, me. The last. Why me?\\n\\n\\n Average, that\\'s what he was. Height: 5\\'11\". Weight: 165. Age: 32.\\n Status: Married, once upon a time.\\n\\n\\n The Norm, with no significant departures, all down the line. Church\\n member, but not a good one. Could that be it? Could the most normal be\\n the most perfect? Had he led the best of all possible lives? Was that\\n it? Had God, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, spared his life, saved\\n him, singled him out because he was most nearly a saint, most nearly\\n Christ-like, most nearly....\\n\\n\\n Lies—His mind snapped back to reality. He half smiled. Saint? Christ?\\n The Second Coming?\\n\\n\\n He was no saint.\\n\\n\\n Charles sighed.\\n\\n\\n What about—?\\nChance. That was it! The laws of probability, the bell-shaped curve,\\n normal distribution, rectilinear regression. More people per square\\n foot in New York than elsewhere. The first person who died was from New\\n York, so the last person who gave way to the disease should come from\\n here too. Spin the wheel; throw the dice; toss the coin.\\n\\n\\n So simple to explain by the laws of chance. No need for any underlying\\n assumptions about good and evil, no need for teleological arguments\\n concerning cause and effect. Simply explain it by chance. Somebody had\\n to be the last to go and that was—\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Charles said, standing up in the quiet of the spring evening.\\n \"No, chance won\\'t do it. No man can reckon with chance. The mind\\n rejects such things. There must be something beyond mere accident.\\n There must be!\"\\n\\n\\n He sighed slowly.\\n\\n\\n \"So now I\\'m a hermit, whether or not I like it,\" he said in derision to\\n the gravel path as he walked along it. \"A hermit in the midst of a city\\n of millions of—No, I forgot. There aren\\'t any more people, are there?\"\\n It was hard to realize, even now. \"A hermit, alone—and I haven\\'t even\\n got a cave....\"\\n\\n\\n Charles stopped walking suddenly. No cave, he thought. No place to\\n sleep out the long one, no place to rest while time came to change\\n things around and make them for the better. No place to hide.\\n\\n\\n And suddenly it was the most important thing in life to him to find his\\n \"cave.\"\\n\\n\\n It took him almost an hour to find the proper tools, and better than\\n two hours more of hard, nighttime work to get the hole dug to his\\n satisfaction. It took almost three hours to find the right sort of\\n casket, durable but not too heavy for one man to handle. He carted it\\n out to a grassy plot close to the center of the park where the grave\\n was. He let the coffin down slowly into the depression, then piled up\\n loose dirt on the sloping sides of the hole so that the rain would wash\\n it down over him.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t very well bury myself,\" he said. \"I guess it will rain after\\n I\\'m gone.\" He looked carefully down at the metallic container.\\n\\n\\n Wait now. There was something wrong, something missing. It was—oh,\\n yes, he caught it. It was the stone. There wasn\\'t any stone to go at\\n the head of the grave. \"I\\'ll have to fix that.\"\\n\\n\\n A sheet of metal, bent double, served for the monument proper. A nearby\\n tool shed yielded up a can of paint and a brush. By the glow of one of\\n the streetlights Charles worked out the inscription.\\n\\n\\n \"It ought to be something impressive,\" he thought out loud. \"Something\\n fitting the occasion.\"\\n\\n\\n What did one say on these situations? There was so little chance to\\n practice up for things like this. But it ought to be good, it ought to\\n be proper.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'In this now hallowed corner of the planet Earth—\\' No. That sounds\\n too ... too....\"\\n\\n\\n Make it simple, he thought. And he finally wrote:\\nHERE LIES THE BODY OF\\n\\n THE LAST MAN ON EARTH\\n\\n\\n Yes. That was it. Simple. Let whoever came afterwards figure out the\\n rest. Let them decide. He smiled and finished the painting.\\n\\n\\n Charles was hungry. He got up and started for one of the restaurants\\n near the park. Later on, when there was more time, he\\'d find a piece\\n of granite and move it to the plot. He could spend his free time\\n carving on it, copying the inscription. He would make it into a real\\n shrine; maybe he would practice up a bit and try to carve a statue to\\n go with the stone.\\n\\n\\n Somehow, though, since things were ready and it didn\\'t make too much\\n difference, it seemed to Charles that he\\'d probably have a long time\\n to wait. \"Maybe it\\'s just a disease, and I\\'m immune. I was immune to\\n smallpox. The vaccination never took. That\\'s probably it.\"\\n\\n\\n He smiled. Strange, but now he wanted very much to go on living,\\n alone or not. There were things he could do, ways to keep occupied.\\n He wouldn\\'t mind it so much. But he wanted more and more desperately\\n with each passing second to retain his foothold on the tenuous path of\\n physical existence.\\n\\n\\n The tantalizing thought of \"why\" puzzled its way back into his mind.\\n But it seemed less pressing now that he had almost come to the\\n conclusion that he would live for a long time. Later, in a few days\\n perhaps, he would think about it. In a little while he\\'d have plenty of\\n opportunity for hunting down the answer. This seemed good to him, for\\n now he thought he almost had the answer, if there were an answer. He\\n thought he had seen the solution peering out at him from the recesses\\n of his mind, and he didn\\'t like the expression on its face. Better to\\n forget.\\nCharles reached the broad boulevard. There was a large cafe just across\\n from him, its front window caved in by a large truck. He stumbled and\\n almost fell as he stepped from the curb.\\n\\n\\n \"Look at me, nervous as a cat.\"\\n\\n\\n He was trembling noticeably as he started across the street.\\n\\n\\n \"I—\" He started to say something, to think something. But some hidden\\n part of his mind clamped down, obscuring the thought, rejecting the\\n concept.\\n\\n\\n The tremor turned to a shake before he reached the far curb, and the\\n first burst of wild pain came as he laid his shoulder against the door\\n to the restaurant. This was the way the plague began, but—His mind\\n quickly repressed the idea. It couldn\\'t be the plague. He was immune!\\n\\n\\n Another burst of pulsating, shattering pain crashed through his body,\\n tearing down the defenses of his mind, putting an end of his thoughts\\n of immunity. Colors flared before his eyes, a persistent, irresistible\\n susurrus flooded his ears.\\n\\n\\n He wanted to protest, but there was no one to listen to him. He\\n appealed to every divinity he knew, all the time knowing it would be\\n useless. His body, out of his voluntary control, tried to run off in\\n all directions at once.\\n\\n\\n Charles struggled to end his body\\'s disorganized responses, to\\n channelize all his energy into one direction. His mind came back into\\n action. He set up his goal; everything else seemed irrelevant: he had\\n to get back to the park, to his hermit\\'s cave, to his long, narrow\\n home. He couldn\\'t die until then.\\n\\n\\n Ten minutes.\\n\\n\\n He was allotted ten minutes before the end.\\n\\n\\n It could have been ten years or ten seconds, for now objective time\\n meant nothing to him. It was not a matter of measuring seconds and\\n minutes. It was a matter of forgetting time and measuring space.\\n\\n\\n He concentrated on the grave; he forced his body to become an unwilling\\n machine. While he could, he walked, forcing himself on. When his legs\\n gave way, he crawled. When his knees buckled, he rolled. When his\\n stomach protested, he vomited. It made no difference.\\n\\n\\n Charles refused to think. Machines, especially half-broken machines, do\\n not think; they only work. Sweating, straining, bleeding, retching, he\\n pushed himself towards his goal, trying to add one final touch of grace\\n and custom to the rude irrationalness of it all.\\n\\n\\n His eyes gave out a few feet from the pit. He felt his way towards it.\\n Convulsions shook his body like a cat shakes a captive mouse. He humped\\n his body forward between the seizures, hands outstretched, searching\\n for the grave.\\n\\n\\n And then he was upon it. One arm reached out for grass, and clutched\\n bare space instead.\\n\\n\\n He was home.\\n\\n\\n He gathered energy from his final reservoirs of strength for one final\\n movement that would throw him headlong into the shallow grave. He\\n tensed his muscles, pulled his limbs up under him and started to roll\\n into the hole.\\n\\n\\n Instantly the thought struck him with paralyzing devastation. The\\n answer to it all poked its face out from the recesses of his mind and\\n sapped the last bit of his energy, corroding his nerves and dying\\n muscles. Now he knew, and the knowing was the end of it.\\n\\n\\n He collapsed at the edge of the pit. Only one arm hung loosely down\\n into it, swinging senseless in the air, pointing accusingly at the\\n empty coffin.\\n\\n\\n The world will end, not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with the\\n last man\\'s anguished cry at the unreasonableness of it all.\\n\\n\\n Charles screamed.\\nThe large, invisible, ovular being that hung suspended over the Empire\\n State Building rested from its exertion. Soon it was approached by\\n another of its kind.\\n\\n\\n \"It is finished?\" asked the second.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Just now. I am resting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can feel the emptiness of it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was very good. Where were you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"On the next planet out. No beauty to it at all; no system. How was\\n yours?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beautiful,\" said the first. \"It went according to the strictest\\n semantic relationship following the purest mathematical principles.\\n They made it easy for me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, where to now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s another system about four thoughts away. We\\'re due there soon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right. Let\\'s go.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that you have there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, this?\" replied the first. \"It\\'s a higher neural order compendium\\n the Things here made up. It\\'s what I used.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t take it with you, you know. They don\\'t allow souvenirs.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, all right. You\\'re so good, see if you can compute the\\n scatter probability.\"\\n\\n\\n The first being moved imperceptably and the heavy plastoid binding of\\n the book disappeared. The thousands of pages dropped softly, caught\\n at the wind like hungry sails, separated, and pulled by the fingers of\\n gravity, went their disparate ways.\\nHere a page scuttled into a broken window of the Chrysler Building\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Aabat, Aabbs, Aabbt\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n Here a page landed upright on the head of one of the library lions\\n and sloughed softly to the ground \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Looman, Loomana,\\n Loomanabsky\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n Here another page crept in between the cracks of a pier on the\\n riverfront, dropping gently to the caressing eddies of the water \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread\\n the names: Smith, Smitha, Smitj\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n And here two pages danced down into Central Park, pirouetted,\\n promenaded, and finally came to rest against a propped-up piece of\\n metal \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Whit, Whita, Whitacomb\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n It was not until the dusty morning sun stirred up the breezes that they\\n fluttered down into the shallow hole beneath, unnoticed.

The Harvard\\n College Radio Station has for several weeks been in receipt\\n of fragmentary signals of extraordinarily long wave-length,\\n Professor Hammond announced yesterday. So far as it has\\n been possible to test the direction of the source of these\\n waves, it appears that the direction has a twenty-four hour\\n cycle, thus indicating that the origin of these waves is some\\n point outside the earth.\\nThe university authorities will express no opinion as to\\n whether or not these messages come from Mars.\\nMyles, alone of all the radio engineers of my acquaintance,\\n was competent to surmount these difficulties, and\\n thus enable the Cambridge savants to receive with clearness\\n the message from another planet.\\n\\n6\\n\\n Twelve months ago he would have been available, for\\n he was then quietly visiting at my farm, after five earth-years\\n spent on the planet Venus, where, by the aid of radio,\\n he had led the Cupians to victory over their oppressors,\\n a human-brained race of gigantic black ants. He had driven\\n the last ant from the face of continental Poros, and had\\n won and wed the Princess Lilla, who had borne him a son\\n to occupy the throne of Cupia.\\n\\n\\n While at my farm Cabot had rigged up a huge radio\\n set and a matter-transmitting apparatus, with which he had\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mpresumably\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m shot himself back to Poros on the night of the\\n big October storm which had wrecked his installation.\\n\\n\\n I showed the newspaper item to Mrs. Farley, and lamented\\n on Cabot’s absence. Her response opened up an\\n entirely new line of thought.\\n\\n\\n Said she: “Doesn’t the very fact that Mr. Cabot isn’t\\n here suggest to you that this may be a message, not from\\n Mars, but from him? Or perhaps from the Princess Lilla,\\n inquiring about him in case he has failed in his attempted\\n return?”\\n\\n\\n That had never occurred to me! How stupid!\\n\\n\\n “What had I better do about it, if anything?” I asked.\\n “Drop Professor Hammond a line?”\\n\\n\\n But Mrs. Farley was afraid that I would be taken for a\\n crank.\\n\\n\\n That evening, when I was over in town, the clerk in the\\n drug store waylaid me to say that there had been a long-distance\\n phone call for me, and would I please call a certain\\n Cambridge number.\\n\\n\\n So, after waiting an interminable time in the stuffy booth\\n with my hands full of dimes, nickels, and quarters, I finally\\n got my party.\\n\\n\\n “Mr. Farley?”\\n\\n\\n “Speaking.”\\n\\n\\n “This is Professor Kellogg, O. D. Kellogg,” the voice\\n replied.\\n\\n7\\n\\n It was my friend of the Harvard math faculty, the man\\n who had analyzed the measurements of the streamline projectile\\n in which Myles Cabot had shot to earth the account\\n of the first part of his adventures on Venus. Some further\\n adventures Myles had told me in person during his stay\\n on my farm.\\n\\n\\n “Professor Hammond thinks that he is getting Mars on the\\n air,” the voice continued.\\n\\n\\n “Yes,” I replied. “I judged as much from what I read in\\n this morning’s paper. But what do\\nyou\\nthink?”\\n\\n\\n Kellogg’s reply gave my sluggish mind the second jolt\\n which it had received that day.\\n\\n\\n “Well,” he said, “in view of the fact that I am one of\\n the few people among your readers who take your radio\\n stories seriously, I think that Hammond is getting Venus.\\n Can you run up here and help me try and convince him?”\\n\\n\\n And so it was that I took the early boat next morning\\n for Boston, and had lunch with the two professors.\\nAs a result of our conference, a small committee of engineers\\n returned with me to Edgartown that evening for\\n the purpose of trying to repair the wrecked radio set which\\n Myles Cabot had left on my farm.\\n\\n\\n They utterly failed to comprehend the matter-transmitting\\n apparatus, and so—after the fallen tower had been reerected\\n and the rubbish cleared away—they had devoted their attention\\n to the restoration of the conversational part of the set.\\n\\n\\n To make a long story short, we finally restored it, with the\\n aid of some old blue prints of Cabot’s which Mrs. Farley,\\n like Swiss Family Robinson’s wife, produced from somewhere.\\n I was the first to try the earphones, and was rewarded by\\n a faint “bzt-bzt” like the song of a north woods blackfly.\\n\\n\\n In conventional radioese, I repeated the sounds to the\\n Harvard group:\\n\\n\\n “Dah-dit-dah-dit dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit\\n dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dit\\n dit. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit dit dit dah-dah-dah\\n dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit-dit-dit\\n dah-dah-dah dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit-dit-dit-dah\\n dah-dah-dah.”\\n\\n8\\n\\n A look of incredulity spread over their faces. Again came\\n the same message, and again I repeated it.\\n\\n\\n “You’re spoofing us!” one of them shouted. “Give\\nme\\nthe earphones.”\\n\\n\\n And he snatched them from my head. Adjusting them on\\n his own head, he spelled out to us, “C-Q C-Q C-Q D-E\\n C-A-B-O-T C-A-B-O-T C-A-B-O-T—”\\n\\n\\n Seizing the big leaf-switch, he threw it over. The motor-generator\\n began to hum. Grasping the key, the Harvard\\n engineer ticked off into space: “Cabot Cabot Cabot D-E—”\\n\\n\\n “Has this station a call letter?” he hurriedly asked me.\\n\\n\\n “Yes,” I answered quickly, “One-X-X-B.”\\n\\n\\n “One-X-X-B,” he continued the ticking “K.”\\n\\n\\n Interplanetary communication was an established fact at\\n last! And not with Mars after all these years of scientific\\n speculations. But what meant more to me was that I was\\n again in touch with my classmate Myles Standish Cabot,\\n the radio man.\\n\\n\\n The next day a party of prominent scientists, accompanied\\n by a telegrapher and two stenographers, arrived at my\\n farm.\\n\\n\\n During the weeks that followed there was recorded\\n Myles’s own account of the amazing adventures on the planet\\n Venus \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mor Poros, as its own inhabitants call it,\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n which befell him upon his return there after his brief visit\\n to the earth. I have edited those notes into the following\\n coherent story.\\nII\\n\\n TOO MUCH STATIC\\nMyles Cabot had returned to the earth to study the\\n latest developments of modern terrestrial science for the\\n benefit of the Cupian nation. He was the regent of Cupia\\n during the minority of his baby son, King Kew the\\n Thirteenth. The loyal Prince Toron occupied the throne in his\\n absence. The last of the ant-men and their ally, the renegade\\n Cupian Prince Yuri, had presumably perished in an attempt\\n to escape by flying through the steam-clouds which completely\\n hem in continental Poros. What lay beyond the\\n boiling seas no man knew.\\n\\n9\\n\\n During his stay on my farm, Cabot had built the matter-transmitting\\n apparatus, with which he had shot himself off\\n into space on that October night on which he had received\\n the message from the skies: “S O S, Lilla.” A thunderstorm\\n had been brewing all that evening, and just as Myles\\n had placed himself between the coordinate axes of his machine\\n and had gathered up the strings which ran from his\\n control levers to within the apparatus, there had come a\\n blinding flash. Lightning had struck his aerial.\\n\\n\\n How long his unconsciousness lasted he knew not. He\\n was some time in regaining his senses. But when he had\\n finally and fully recovered, he found himself lying on a\\n sandy beach beside a calm and placid lake beneath a silver\\n sky.\\n\\n\\n He fell to wondering, vaguely and pleasantly, where he\\n was and how he had got here.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly, however, his ears were jarred by a familiar\\n sound. At once his senses cleared, and he listened intently\\n to the distant purring of a motor. Yes, there could be no\\n mistake; an airplane was approaching. Now he could see\\n it, a speck in the sky, far down the beach.\\n\\n\\n Nearer and nearer it came.\\n\\n\\n Myles sprang to his feet. To his intense surprise, he found\\n that the effort threw him quite a distance into the air. Instantly\\n the idea flashed through his mind: “I must be on\\n Mars! Or some other strange planet.” This idea was vaguely\\n reminiscent of something.\\n\\n\\n But while he was trying to catch this vaguely elusive\\n train of thought, his attention was diverted by the fact that,\\n for some unaccountable reason, his belt buckle and most of\\n the buttons which had held his clothes together were missing,\\n so that his clothing came to pieces as he rose, and that\\n he had to shed it rapidly in order to avoid impeding his\\n movements. He wondered at the cause of this.\\n\\n10\\n\\n But his speculations were cut short by the alighting of the\\n plane a hundred yards down the beach.\\n\\n\\n What was his horror when out of it clambered, not men\\n but ants! Ants, six-footed, and six feet high. Huge ants, four\\n of them, running toward him over the glistening sands.\\n\\n\\n Gone was all his languor, as he seized a piece of driftwood\\n and prepared to defend himself.\\n\\n\\n As he stood thus expectant, Myles realized that his present\\n position and condition, the surrounding scenery, and the advance\\n of the ant-men were exactly, item for item, like the\\n opening events of his first arrival on the planet Poros. He\\n even recognized one of the ant-men as old Doggo, who had\\n befriended him on his previous visit.\\n\\n\\n Could it be that all his adventures in Cupia had been\\n naught but a dream; a recurring dream, in fact? Were his\\n dear wife Lilla and his little son Kew merely figments of\\n his imagination? Horrible thought!\\n\\n\\n And then events began to differ from those of the past;\\n for the three other Formians halted, and Doggo advanced\\n alone. By the agitation of the beast’s antennae the earth\\n man could see that it was talking to him. But Myles no\\n longer possessed the wonderful electrical headset which he\\n had contrived and built during his previous visit to that\\n planet, so as to talk with Cupians and Formians, both of\\n which races are earless and converse by means of radiations\\n from their antennae.\\n\\n\\n So he picked up two sticks from the beach, and held\\n them projecting from his forehead; then threw them to the\\n ground with a grimace of disgust and pointed to his ears.\\n\\n\\n Doggo understood, and scratched with his paw in Cupian\\n shorthand on the silver sands the message: “Myles Cabot,\\n you are our prisoner.”\\n\\n\\n “What, again?” scratched Myles, then made a sign of\\n submission.\\n\\n11\\n\\n He dreaded the paralyzing bite which Formians usually\\n administer to their victims, and which he had twice experienced\\n in the past; but, fortunately, it was not now\\n forthcoming.\\n\\n\\n The other three ants kept away from him as Doggo led\\n him to the beached airplane, and soon they were scudding\\n along beneath silver skies, northward as it later turned out.\\n\\n\\n Far below them were silver-green fields and tangled\\n tropical woods, interspersed with rivulets and little ponds.\\nThis was Cupia, his Cupia. He was home once more,\\n back again upon the planet which held all that was dear\\n to him in two worlds.\\n\\n\\n His heart glowed with the warmth of homecoming.\\n What mattered it that he was now a prisoner, in the hands\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mor, rather, claws\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m of his old enemies, the Formians? He\\n had been their prisoner before, and had escaped. Once more\\n he could escape, and rescue the Princess Lilla.\\n\\n\\n Poor girl! How eager he was to reach her side, and save\\n her from that peril, whatever it was, which had caused her\\n to flash that “S O S” a hundred million miles across the\\n solar system from Poros to the earth.\\n\\n\\n He wondered what could have happened in Cupia since\\n his departure, only a few sangths ago. How was it that\\n the ant-men had survived their airplane journey across the\\n boiling seas? What had led them to return? Or perhaps\\n these ants were a group who had hidden somewhere and\\n thus had escaped the general extermination of their race.\\n In either event, how had they been able to reconquer\\n Cupia? And where was their former leader, Yuri, the renegade\\n Cupian prince?\\n\\n\\n These and a hundred other similar questions flooded in\\n upon the earth-man, as the Formian airship carried him, a\\n captive, through the skies.\\n\\n\\n He gazed again at the scene below, and now noted one\\n difference from the accustomed Porovian landscape, for nowhere\\n ran the smooth concrete roads which bear the swift\\n two-wheeled kerkools of the Cupians to all parts of their\\n continent. What uninhabited portion of Cupia could this be,\\n over which they were now passing?\\n\\n12\\n\\n Turning to Doggo, Myles extended his left palm, and\\n made a motion as though writing on it with the thumb\\n and forefinger of his right hand. But the ant-man waved\\n a negative with one of his forepaws. It was evident that\\n there were no writing materials aboard the ship. Myles\\n would have to wait until they reached their landing place;\\n for doubtless they would soon hover down in some city\\n or town, though just which one he could not guess, as the\\n country below was wholly unfamiliar.\\n\\n\\n Finally a small settlement loomed ahead. It was of the\\n familiar style of toy-building-block architecture affected by\\n the ant-men, and, from its appearance, was very new. On its\\n outskirts further building operations were actively in progress.\\n Apparently a few survivors of the accursed race of Formians\\n were consolidating their position and attempting to build\\n up a new empire in some out-of-the-way portion of the continent.\\n\\n\\n As the earth-man was turning these thoughts over in his\\n mind the plane softly settled down upon one of the flat\\n roofs, and its occupants disembarked. Three of the ants\\n advanced menacingly toward Myles, but Doggo held them\\n off. Then all of the party descended down one of the ramps\\n to the lower levels of the building.\\n\\n\\n Narrow slitlike window openings gave onto courtyards,\\n where fountains played and masses of blue and yellow flowers\\n bloomed, amid gray-branched lichens with red and purple\\n twig-knobs. It was in just such a garden, through just\\n such a window, that he had first looked upon the lovely\\n blue-eyed, golden-haired Lilla, Crown Princess of Cupia.\\n\\n\\n The earth-man sighed. Where was his beloved wife now?\\n That she needed his help was certain. He must therefore\\n get busy. So once again he made motions of writing on the\\n palm of his left hand with the thumb and forefinger of his\\n right; and this time the sign language produced results,\\n for Doggo halted the procession and led Cabot into a room.\\n\\n13\\n\\n It was a plain bare room, devoid of any furniture except\\n a small table, for ant-men have no use for chairs and\\n couches. The sky outside was already beginning to pinken\\n with the unseen sun.\\n\\n\\n With a sweep of his paw, Doggo indicated that this was\\n to be Cabot’s quarters. Then, with another wave, he\\n pointed to the table, where lay a pad of paper and stylus,\\n not a pencil-like stylus as employed by the Cupians, but\\n rather one equipped with straps for attaching it to the claw\\n of a Formian.\\n\\n\\n Even so, it was better than nothing. The earth-man seized\\n it eagerly, but before he could begin writing an ant entered\\n bearing a Cupian toga, short-sleeved and bordered with\\n Grecian wave designs in blue. Myles put on this garment,\\n and then quickly filled a sheet with questions:\\n\\n\\n “How is my princess and my son, the baby king? Whence\\n come all you Formians, whose race I thought had been\\n exterminated? What part of Cupia is this? What is this city?\\n Where is Prince Yuri? And what do you intend to do with\\n me\\nthis\\ntime?”\\n\\n\\n Then he passed the paper and stylus over to his old\\n friend Doggo. They were alone together at last.\\nThe ant-man’s reply consumed sheet after sheet of paper;\\n but, owning to the rapidity of Porovian shorthand, did not\\n take so very much more time than speaking would have\\n required. As he completed each sheet he passed it over to\\n Myles, who read as follows:\\n\\n\\n “As to your princess and your son, I know not, for this\\n is not Cupia. Do you remember how, when your victorious\\n army and air navy swept to the southern extremity of what\\n had been Formia, a few of our survivors rose in planes from\\n the ruins of our last stronghold and braved the dangers\\n of the steam clouds which overhang the boiling seas? Our\\n leader was Prince Yuri, erstwhile contender for the throne\\n of Cupia, splendid even in defeat.\\n\\n\\n “It was his brain that conceived our daring plan of\\n escape. If there were other lands beyond the boiling seas,\\n the lands which tradition taught were the origin of the\\n Cupian race, then there we might prosper and raise up a\\n new empire. At the worst we should merely meet death in\\n another form, rather than at your hands. So we essayed.\\n\\n14\\n\\n “Your planes followed us, but turned back as we neared\\n the area of terrific heat. Soon the vapor closed over us,\\n blotting our enemies and our native land from view.”\\n\\n\\n For page after page Doggo, the ant-man, related the\\n harrowing details of that perilous flight across the boiling\\n seas, ending with the words:\\n\\n\\n “Here we are, and here are you, in Yuriana, capitol of\\n New Formia. But how is it that you, Myles Cabot, have\\n arrived here on this continent in exactly the same manner\\n and condition in which I discovered you in\\nold\\nFormia\\n eight years ago?”\\n\\n\\n When Myles reached the end of reading this narrative, he\\n in turn took the pad and stylus and related how he had\\n gone to the planet Minos \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mwhich we call the Earth\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m to learn\\n the latest discoveries and inventions there, and how his\\n calculations for his return to Poros had been upset by some\\n static conditions just as he had been about to transmit\\n himself back. Oh, if only he had landed by chance upon\\n the same beach as on his first journey through the skies!\\n\\n\\n Wisely he refrained from mentioning the “S O S” message\\n from Lilla. But his recollection of her predicament\\n spurred him to be anxious about her rescue.\\n\\n\\n His immediate problem was to learn what the ant-men\\n planned for him; so the concluding words which he wrote\\n upon the pad were: “And, now that you have me in your\\n power, what shall you do with me?”\\n\\n\\n “Old friend,” Doggo wrote in reply, “that depends entirely\\n upon Yuri, our king, whose toga you now have on.”\\nIII\\n\\n YURI OR FORMIS?\\nThe earth-man grimaced, but then smiled. Perhaps, his\\n succeeding to the toga of King Yuri might prove to be an\\n omen.\\n\\n15\\n\\n “So Yuri is king of the ants?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n “Yes,” his captor replied, “for Queen Formis did not survive\\n the trip across the boiling seas.”\\n\\n\\n “Then what of your empire?” Myles inquired. “No queen.\\n No eggs. How can your race continue? For you Formians are\\n like the ants on my own planet Minos.”\\n\\n\\n Doggo’s reply astounded him.\\n\\n\\n “Do you remember back at Wautoosa, I told you that\\n some of us lesser Formians had occasionally laid eggs? So\\n now behold before you Doggo, Admiral of the Formian\\n Air Navy, and mother of a new Queen Formis.”\\n\\n\\n This was truly a surprise! All along Cabot had always\\n regarded the Formians as mannish. And rightly so, for they\\n performed in their own country the duties assigned to men\\n among the Cupians. Furthermore, all Formians, save only\\n the reigning Formis herself, were called by the Porovian\\n pronoun, which corresponds to “he” in English.\\n\\n\\n When Myles had somewhat recovered from his astonishment,\\n he warmly congratulated his friend by patting him\\n on the side of the head, as is the Porovian custom.\\n\\n\\n “Doggo,” he wrote, “this ought to constitute you a person\\n of some importance among the Formians.”\\n\\n\\n “It\\nought\\nto,” the ant-man replied, “but as a matter of\\n fact, it merely intensifies Yuri’s mistrust and hatred of me.\\n Now that I am mother of the queen, he fears that I may\\n turn against him and establish Formis in his place as the\\n head of an empire of the Formians, by the Formians, and\\n for the Formians exclusively.”\\n\\n\\n “Why don’t you?” Myles wrote. It seemed to him to be\\n a bully good idea, and incidentally a solution of his own\\n difficulties.\\n\\n\\n But Doggo wrote in horror, “It would be treason!” Then\\n tore up all the correspondence. It is difficult to inculcate the\\n thought of independence in the mind of one reared in an\\n autocracy.\\n\\n\\n The earth-man, however, persisted.\\n\\n\\n “How many of the council can you count on, if the interests\\n of Yuri should clash with those of Formis?”\\n\\n16\\n\\n “Only one—myself.”\\n\\n\\n And again Doggo tore up the correspondence.\\n\\n\\n Myles tactfully changed the subject.\\n\\n\\n “Where is the arch-fiend now?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n “We know not,” the Formian wrote in reply. “Six days\\n ago he left us in his airship and flew westward. When he\\n failed to return, we sent out scout planes to search for\\n him, and we have been hunting ever since. When we\\n sighted you on the beach this morning we thought that\\n you might be our lost leader, and that is why we landed and\\n approached you.”\\n\\n\\n At about this point the conversation was interrupted by\\n a worker ant who brought food: roast alta and green aphid\\n milk. With what relish did the earth-man plunge into the\\n feast, his first taste of Porovian delicacies in many months.\\n\\n\\n During the meal conversation lagged, owing to the difficulty\\n of writing and eating at the same time. But now\\n Myles Cabot seized his pad and stylus and wrote:\\n\\n\\n “Have you ever known me to fail in any undertaking\\n on the planet Poros?”\\n\\n\\n “No,” the ant-man wrote in reply.\\n\\n\\n “Have you ever known me to be untrue to a principle,\\n a cause, or a friend?”\\n\\n\\n “No,” Doggo replied.\\n\\n\\n “Then,” Myles wrote, “let us make your daughter queen\\n in fact as well as in name.”\\n\\n\\n “It is treason,” Doggo wrote in reply, but this time he\\n did not tear up the correspondence.\\n\\n\\n “Treason?” Myles asked. If he had spoken the word, he\\n would have spoken it with scorn and derision. “Treason?\\n Is it treason to support your own queen? What has become\\n of the national pride of the once great Formians? Look!\\n I pledge myself to the cause of Formis, rightful Queen of\\n Formia. Formis, daughter of Doggo! What say you?”\\n\\n\\n This time, as he tore up the correspondence, Doggo\\n signified an affirmative. And thus there resulted further\\n correspondence.\\n\\n17\\n\\n “Doggo,” Myles wrote, “can you get to the antenna of\\n the queen?”\\n\\n\\n The ant-man indicated that he could.\\n\\n\\n “If she has inherited any of your character,” Myles continued,\\n “she will assert herself, if given half a chance.”\\nSo the Pitmanesque conversation continued. Long since had\\n the pink light of Porovian evening faded from the western\\n sky. The ceiling vapor-lamps were lit. The night showed velvet-black\\n through the slit-like windows. And still the two old\\n friends wrote on, Myles Standish Cabot, the Bostonian, and\\n Doggo, No. 334-2-18, the only really humanlike ant-man\\n whom Myles had ever known among the once dominant\\n race of Poros.\\n\\n\\n Finally, as the dials indicated midnight, the two conspirators\\n ceased their labors. All was arranged for the\\ncoup d’ etat\\n.\\n\\n\\n They tore into shreds every scrap of used paper, leaving\\n extant merely the ant-man’s concluding words: “Meanwhile\\n you are my prisoner.”\\n\\n\\n Doggo then rang a soundless bell, which was answered\\n by a worker ant, whom he inaudibly directed to bring\\n sufficient draperies to form a bed for the earth-man. These\\n brought, the two friends patted each other a fond good\\n night, and the tired earth-man lay down for the first sleep\\n which he had had in over forty earth hours.\\n\\n\\n It hardly seemed possible! Night before last he had slept\\n peacefully on a conventional feather-bed in a little New\\n England farmhouse. Then had come the S O S message\\n from the skies; and here he was now, millions of miles\\n away through space retiring on matted silver felting on the\\n concrete floor of a Porovian ant-house. Such are the mutations\\n of fortune!\\n\\n\\n With these thoughts the returned wanderer lapsed into\\n a deep and dreamless sleep.\\n\\n\\n When he awakened in the morning there was a guard\\n posted at the door.\\n\\n18\\n\\n Doggo did not show up until nearly noon, when he\\n rattled in, bristling with excitement.\\n\\n\\n Seizing the pad he wrote: “A stormy session of the Council\\n of Twelve! We are all agreed that you must be indicted\\n for high crimes and misdemeanors. But the great question\\n is as to just what we can charge you with.”\\n\\n\\n “Sorry I can’t assist you,” the earth-man wrote. “How\\n would it be if I were to slap your daughter’s face, or\\n something? Or why not try me for general cussedness?”\\n\\n\\n “That is just what we finally decided to do,” the ant-man\\n wrote in reply. “We shall try you on general principles,\\n and let the proper accusation develop from the evidence.\\n\\n\\n “At some stage of the proceedings it will inevitably occur\\n to some member of the council to suggest that you be\\n charged with treason to Yuri, whereupon two members of\\n the council, whom I have won over to the cause of my\\n daughter, will raise the objection that Yuri is not our king.\\n This will be the signal for the proclaiming of Queen Formis.\\n If you will waive counsel the trial can take place to-morrow.”\\n\\n\\n “I will waive anything,” Myles replied, “counsel, immunity,\\n extradition, anything in order to speed up my return\\n to Cupia, where Lilla awaits in some dire extremity.”\\n\\n\\n “All right,” Doggo wrote, and the conference was at an\\n end. The morrow would decide the ascendancy of Myles\\n Cabot or the Prince Yuri over the new continent.\\nIV\\n\\n THE COUP D’ETAT\\nThe next morning Myles Cabot was led under guard to the\\n council chamber of the dread thirteen: Formis and her\\n twelve advisers. The accused was placed in a wicker cage,\\n from which he surveyed his surroundings as the proceedings\\n opened.\\n\\n19\\n\\n On a raised platform stood the ant queen, surmounted by\\n a scarlet canopy, which set off the perfect proportions of\\n her jet-black body. On each side of her stood six refined\\n and intelligent ant-men, her councillors. One of the twelve\\n was Doggo.\\n\\n\\n Messenger ants hurried hither and thither.\\n\\n\\n First the accusation was read, Myles being furnished\\n with a written copy.\\n\\n\\n The witnesses were then called. They were veterans who\\n had served in the wars in which Cabot had twice freed\\n Cupia from the domination of its Formian oppressors.\\n They spoke with bitterness of the downfall of their beloved\\n Formia. Their testimony was brief.\\n\\n\\n Then the accused was asked if he wished to say anything\\n in his own behalf. Myles rose, then shrugged his shoulders,\\n sat down again, and wrote: “I fully realize the futility of\\n making an argument through the antennae of another.”\\n\\n\\n Whereupon the queen and the council went into executive\\n session. Their remarks were not intended for the eyes\\n of the prisoner, but he soon observed that some kind of a\\n dispute was on between Doggo, supported by two councillors\\n named Emu and Fum on one side, and a councillor named\\n Barth on the other.\\n\\n\\n As this dispute reached its height, a messenger ant rushed\\n in and held up one paw. Cabot’s interpreter, not deeming\\n this a part of the executive session, obligingly translated the\\n following into writing:\\n\\n\\n The messenger: “Yuri lives and reigns over Cupia. It is his\\n command that Cabot die.”\\n\\n\\n Barth: “It is the radio. Know then, O Queen, and ye,\\n members of the council, that when we fled across the boiling\\n seas under the gallant leadership of Prince Yuri, the man\\n with the heart of a Formian, he brought with him one of\\n those powerful radio sets invented by the beast who is our\\n prisoner here to-day.\\n\\n\\n “Supporters of Yuri still remained among the Cupians,\\n and he has been in constant communication with these ever\\n since shortly after our arrival here. From them he learned\\n of the return of Myles Cabot to the planet Minos.\\n\\n20\\n\\n “Then Yuri disappeared. Those of us who were closest\\n to him suspected that he had gone back across the boiling\\n seas to claim as his own the throne of Cupia. But we hesitated\\n to announce this until we were sure, for we feared that\\n some of our own people would regard his departure as\\n desertion. Yet who can blame him for returning to his father-land\\n and to the throne which is his by rights?”\\n\\n\\n To which the messenger added: “And he offers to give us\\n back our own old country, if we too will return across the\\n boiling seas again.”\\n\\n\\n “It is a lie!” Doggo shouted.\\n\\n\\n “Yuri, usurper of the thrones of two continents. Bah!”\\n shouted Emu.\\n\\n\\n “Yuri, our rightful leader,” shouted Barth.\\n\\n\\n “Give us a queen of our own race,” shouted Fum.\\n\\n\\n “Release the prisoner,” shouted the Queen.\\n\\n\\n And that is all that Myles learned of the conversation,\\n for his interpreter at this juncture stopped writing and\\n obeyed the queen. The earth-man was free!\\n\\n\\n With one bound he gained the throne, where fighting\\n was already in progress between the two factions. Barth\\n and Doggo were rolling over and over on the floor in a\\n death grapple, while the ant-queen had backed to the rear\\n of the stage, closely guarded by Emu and Fum.\\n\\n\\n Seizing one of the pikes which supported the scarlet\\n canopy, Myles wrenched it loose and drove it into the thorax\\n of Barth. In another instant the earth-man and Doggo stood\\n beside the queen.\\n\\n\\n Ant-men now came pouring into the chamber through all\\n the entrances, taking sides as they entered and sized up the\\n situation. If it had still been in vogue among the Formians\\n to be known by numbers rather than names, and to have\\n these identifying numbers painted on the backs of their\\n abdomens followed by the numbers of those whom they\\n had defeated in the duels so common among them, then\\n many a Formian would have “got the number” of many\\n another, that day.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Instruments\\n reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\\n stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\\n enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He\\n snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\\n \"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\\n even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\\n and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\\n\\n\\n The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\\n\"You see?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\\n others in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\\n their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\\n\\n\\n The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\\n spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\\n head. \"Svan, I\\'m afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\\n is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\\n trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan laughed harshly. \"\\nThey\\ndon\\'t think so. You heard them. We are\\n not human any more. The officer said it.\"\\n\\n\\n The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\\n agreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\\n around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\\n convinced by Svan.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\\n assent.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\\n alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\\n Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\\n return.\"\\n\\n\\n An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\\n complained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\\n authorized—murder?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\\n Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\\n Earth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\\n dull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\\n feet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\\n ship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the\\n surface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty\\n hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\\n faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty,\\n irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\\n off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\\n mark on one of them, held it up.\\n\\n\\n \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\\n there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\\n\\n\\n No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\\n bowl.\"\\n\\n\\n Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\\n of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\\n left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\\n creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\\n with his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\\n and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\\n himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\\n slips.\\n\\n\\n Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\\n \"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\\n car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city\\n has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\\n find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\\n The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\\n car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\\n guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough,\\n after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that\\'s all there is to\\n it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\\n of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\\n dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\\n from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\\n\\n\\n There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\\n uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\\n\\n\\n Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\\n Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\\n striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\\n\\n\\n And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second\\'s\\n glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\\n Almost he was disappointed.\\n\\n\\n Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\\n up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\\n one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....\\n\\n\\n Then gray understanding came to him.\\nA traitor!\\nhis subconscious\\n whispered.\\nA coward!\\nHe stared at them in a new light, saw their\\n indecision magnified, became opposition.\\n\\n\\n Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\\n coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\\n be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\\n every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\\n of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\\n Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\\n beneath the table, marked his own slip.\\n\\n\\n In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\\n secret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\\nThe six conspirators in Svan\\'s old ground car moved slowly along the\\n main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except\\n for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the\\n entrance to the town\\'s Hall of Justice.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We\\n have ample time.\"\\n\\n\\n He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching\\n the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.\\n Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?\\n\\n\\n The right answer leaped up at him.\\nThey all are\\n, he thought.\\nNot one\\n of them understands what this means. They\\'re afraid.\\nHe clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was\\n driving. \"Let\\'s get this done with.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her\\n eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy\\n car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite\\n dark now. The car\\'s driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,\\n illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the\\n jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The\\n present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off\\n again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\\n\\n\\n A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence\\n that followed its thunderous crash, a man\\'s voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the\\n brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them\\n from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\\n\\n\\n Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened\\n the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard\\n it was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is\\n that not permitted?\"\\n\\n\\n The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The\\n order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It\\n is urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a\\n complicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\\n Confusion furrowed the guard\\'s hairless brows, then was replaced by\\n a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\\n \"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\"\\n He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was\\n faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.\\n He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against\\n the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan\\n savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like\\n nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength\\n in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial\\n advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard\\n lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had\\n ruthlessly pounded it against the road.\\nSvan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\\nSvan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the\\n petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,\\n then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over\\n the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the\\n jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be\\n no trace.\\n\\n\\n Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now\\n there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep\\n a watch for other guards.\"\\nVenus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.\\n Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow\\n of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away\\n at the computer\\'s table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of\\n course, you can\\'t tell. Might be a raiding party.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no\\n answer in his stolid face. \"Don\\'t joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose\\n something happens to the delegation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then we\\'re in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you\\n the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They\\'ve been prohibited for the\\n last three hundred years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they\\'ve doubled the\\n guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they\\n know how. You heard the delegation\\'s report on the intercom. It\\'s this\\n secret group they call the Council.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And how do you know the guards themselves don\\'t belong to it?\" the\\n Exec retorted. \"They\\'re all the same to me.... Look, your light\\'s gone\\n out now. Must have been the guard. They\\'re on the wrong side to be\\n coming from the town, anyhow....\"\\nSvan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the\\n lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment\\n under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get\\n the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.\\n Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been\\ntwo\\nbombs in\\n the compartment, though Svan\\'s hand emerged with only one.\\n\\n\\n He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he\\n said. \"They won\\'t be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we\\n were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\"\\n\\n\\n Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back\\n again,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car\\n into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan, listening, thought:\\nIt\\'s not much of a plan. The guards would\\n not be drawn away. I am glad I can\\'t trust these five any more. If\\n they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a\\n purpose.\\nAloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the\\n city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because\\n the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,\\n you are in no danger from the guards.\"\\nFrom the guards\\n, his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would\\n feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in\\n that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a\\n ground-shaking crash.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting\\n off the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached\\n for him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of\\n the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,\\n sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few\\n hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.\\n\\n\\n Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?\\n Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?\\n\\n\\n There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was\\n driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And\\n since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked\\n slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\\n\\n\\n He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the\\n jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed\\n lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by\\n its own fierce rockets. Svan\\'s mist-trained eyes spotted the circling\\n figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship\\'s own.\\n They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those\\n slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the\\n side of the ship.\\n\\n\\n Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.\\n He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went\\n absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He\\n turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first\\n cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?\\nHe became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car\\n was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare\\n of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.\\n\\n\\n Paralyzed, he heard the girl\\'s voice. \"Svan! They\\'re coming! They found\\n the guard\\'s rifle, and they\\'re looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,\\n with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came\\n for you. We must flee!\"\\n\\n\\n He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly.\\n Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb\\n in the car—\\n\\n\\n \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and\\n swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before\\n something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted\\n from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force\\n onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the\\n sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to\\n feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\\n\\n\\n The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He\\'s still alive,\" he said\\n callously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won\\'t last long, though.\\n What\\'ve you got there?\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two\\n halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a\\n connection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type,\\n delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,\\n and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won\\'t do any bombing\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.\\n The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It\\'s poetic justice if I ever saw it.\\n They had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of\\n paper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don\\'t get,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on\\n it? What about it?\"\\n\\n\\n The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had\\n the devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over\\n slowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be\\n doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

HALEY\\nCasey Ritter, the guy who never turned\\n \\ndown a dare, breathed a prayer to the gods\\n \\nof idiots and spacemen, and headed in toward\\n \\nthe great red spot of terrible Jupiter.\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Fall 1954.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThose methane and ammonia planets, take it from me, they\\'re the\\n dead-end of creation, and why the Old Man ever thought them up I\\'ll\\n never know. I never thought I\\'d mess around any of them, but things\\n can sure happen. A man can get himself backed into a corner in this\\n little old solar system. It just ain\\'t big enough for a gent of scope\\n and talent; and the day the Solar System Customs caught me red-handed\\n smuggling Kooleen crystals in from Mars, I knew I was in that corner,\\n and sewed up tight.\\n\\n\\n Sure, the crystals are deadly, but I was smuggling them legitimately,\\n in a manner of speaking, for this doctor to experiment with. He wasn\\'t\\n going to sell them for dope. But—and this was the \\'but\\' that was\\n likely to deprive the System of my activities—even experimenting with\\n them was illegal even if it needed to be done; also, I had promised not\\n to rat on him before taking the job.\\n\\n\\n Well, Casey Ritter may be a lot of things we won\\'t mention, but he\\n doesn\\'t rat on his clients. So there I was, closeted with the ten\\n members of the S.S. Customs Court, getting set to hear the gavel\\n fall and the head man intone the sentence that would take me out of\\n circulation for a long, long time. And instead, blast me, if they\\n didn\\'t foul me with this trip to good old Jupiter.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t get it at first. I\\'d argued with \\'em, but inside I\\'d been all\\n set for the sentence, and even sort of reconciled to it. I could even\\n hear the words in my mind. But they didn\\'t match what the judge was\\n saying. I stood there gaping like a beached fish while I sorted it out.\\n Then I croaked, \"Jupiter! What for? Are you running outa space in stir?\\n Want to choke me to death in chlorine instead?\" Being civil to the\\n court didn\\'t seem important just then. Jupiter was worse than the pen,\\n a lot worse. Jupiter was a death sentence.\\n\\n\\n The senior judge rapped sharply with his gavel. He frowned me down and\\n then nodded at the judge on his right. This bird, a little old hank of\\n dried-up straw, joined his fingertips carefully, cleared his scrawny\\n throat, and told me what for.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve no doubt heard tales of the strange population of Jupiter,\"\\n he said. \"Every spaceman has, I am sure. Insect-like creatures who\\n manifestly migrated there from some other system and who inhabit\\n the Red Spot of the planet, floating in some kind of artificial\\n anti-gravity field in the gaseous portion of the atmosphere—\"\\n\\n\\n I snorted. \"Aw, hell, judge, that\\'s just one of those screwy fairy\\n tales! How could any—\"\\n\\n\\n The senior judge rapped ferociously, and I skidded to a halt. Our\\n little story teller patiently cleared his skinny throat again.\\n \"I assure you it is no fairy tale. We possess well-authenticated\\n photographs of these inhabitants, and if you are prepared to visit them\\n and in some way worm from them the secret of their anti-gravity field,\\n the government stands ready to issue you a full pardon as well as a\\n substantial monetary reward. Your talents, Mr. Ritter, seem, shall we\\n say, eminently suited to the task.\"\\nHe beamed at me. I looked around. They were all beaming. At me!\\n Suddenly I smelled a rat as big as an elephant. That whole Kooleen\\n caper: Had it been just a trap to lead me straight to this? I hadn\\'t\\n been able to figure how they\\'d cracked my setup....\\n\\n\\n At the thought my larynx froze up tight. This was worse than I\\'d\\n thought. Government men trapping me and then beaming at me. And a full\\n pardon. And a reward. Oh, no! I told myself, it wasn\\'t possible. Not\\n when I already had more counts against me than a cur has fleas. Not\\n unless it was a straight suicide mission!\\n\\n\\n I feebly massaged my throat. \"Pictures?\" I whispered. \"Show me \\'em.\"\\n Crude, but it was all I could squeeze out.\\n\\n\\n I squeezed out more when I saw those pictures, though. Those\\n inhabitants were charming, just charming if you like scorpions. Well,\\n a cross between a scorpion and a grasshopper, to be accurate. Floating\\n among that red stuff, they showed up a kind of sickly purple turning to\\n gangrene around the edges.\\n\\n\\n The bleat of anguish that accompanied my first view of those beauties\\n had taken my voice again. \"How big?\" I whispered.\\n\\n\\n He shrugged, trying for nonchalance. \"About the size of a man, I\\n believe.\"\\n\\n\\n I raised my shrinking head. \"Take me to jail!\" I said firmly, and\\n collapsed onto my chair.\\n\\n\\n A crafty-eyed buzzard across the table leaned toward me. \"So this is\\n the great Casey Ritter, daredevil of the Solar System!\" he sneered.\\n \"Never loses a bet, never turns down a dare!\"\\n\\n\\n I shuddered. \"You\\'re telling that one! And besides, a man\\'s got to draw\\n the line somewhere. And I\\'m drawing it right here. Take me to jail!\"\\n\\n\\n They were really stumped. They hadn\\'t expected me to take this attitude\\n at all. No doubt they had it figured that I\\'d gratefully throw myself\\n into a sea of ammonia among man-size scorpions just for the hell of\\n it. Nuts! After all, in the pen a man can eat and breathe, and a guard\\n won\\'t reach in and nip off an arm or leg while he\\'s got his back\\n turned. How stupid could they get?\\n\\n\\n When I finally wore them down and got to my little cell, I looked\\n around it with a feeling of real coziness. I even patted the walls\\n chummily and snapped a salute at the guard. It makes me grind my molars\\n now to think of it. The way that bunch of stuffed shirts in the S.S.C.\\n made a gold-barred chimpanzee out of me has broken my spirit and\\n turned me into an honest trader. Me, Casey Ritter, slickest slicker in\\n the Solar System, led like a precious infant right where I\\'d flatly\\n refused to go! In plain English, I underestimated the enemy. Feeling\\n safe and secure in the grip of the good old Iron College, I relaxed.\\n\\n\\n At this strategic point, the enemy planted a stoolie on me. Not in my\\n cell block. They were too smart for that. But we met at recreation, and\\n his mug seemed familiar, like a wisp of smoke where no smoke has got a\\n right to be; and after awhile I braced him.\\n\\n\\n I was right. I\\'d met the shrimp before when I was wound up in an\\n asteroid real estate racket. Pard Hoskins was his alias, and he had the\\n tag of being a real slick operator. We swapped yarns for about a week\\n when we met, and then I asked him what\\'s his rap this trip.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, a pretty good jolt if they can keep hold of me,\" he says. \"I just\\n made a pass at the Killicut Emeralds, that\\'s all, and got nabbed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, no!\" I moaned. \"What were you trying to do, start a feud between\\n us and Mars?\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged, but his little black-currant eyes began to sparkle with\\n real passion, the high voltage kind that only a woman in a million, or\\n a million in a bank, can kindle in a guy. \"Buddy,\" he said reverently,\\n \"I\\'d start more than that just to get me mitts on them stones again!\\n Why, you ain\\'t never seen jools till you\\'ve seen them! Big as hen\\'s\\n eggs, an even dozen of \\'em; and flawless, I\\'m a-shoutin\\', not a flaw!\"\\n His eyes watered at the memory, yearning like a hound-dog\\'s over a\\n fresh scent.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t believe it. Those emeralds were in the inner shrine of the\\n super-sacred, super-secret temple of the cavern-dwelling tribe of\\n Killicuts on Mars—the real aborigines. Bleachies, we call them, sort\\n of contemptuously; but those Bleachies are a rough lot when they\\'re\\n mad, and if Pard had really got near those emeralds, he should be\\n nothing but a heap of cleaned bones by now. Either he was the world\\'s\\n champion liar or its bravest son, and either way I took my hat off to\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'d you make the getaway?\" I asked, taking him at his word.\\n\\n\\n He looked loftily past me. \"Sorry. Gotta keep that a secret. Likewise\\n where I cached \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Cached what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The rocks, stupe.\"\\n\\n\\n I hardly heard the cut. \"You mean you really did get away with them?\"\\n My jaw must\\'ve been hanging down a foot, because I\\'d just been playing\\n along with him, not really believing him, and now all of a sudden I\\n somehow knew that he\\'d really lifted those emeralds. But how? It was\\n impossible. I\\'d investigated once myself.\\n\\n\\n He nodded and then moved casually away. I looked up and saw a guard\\n coming.\\n\\n\\n That night I turned on my hard prison cot until my bones were so much\\n jelly, trying to figure that steal. The next morning I got up burning\\n with this fever for information, only to find that Pard had got himself\\n put in solitary for mugging a guard, and that really put the heat on\\n me. I chewed my fingernails down to the quick by the time he got out a\\n week later.\\nBy that time he really had me hooked. I\\'d of sworn he was leveling\\n with me. But he wouldn\\'t tell me how he\\'d worked the steal. Instead,\\n he opened up on the trade he\\'d booked for the string. He said, \"When I\\n chisel me way outa this squirrel cage, I\\'m gonna hit fer good old Jupe\\n and sell \\'em to Akroida. She\\'s nuts about jools. What that old girl\\n won\\'t give me fer \\'em—\" He whistled appreciatively, thinking about it.\\n\\n\\n \"Jupiter!\" I goggled at him. \"Akroida! Who\\'s she?\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me as if I hadn\\'t yet got out from under the rock where he\\n was sure I\\'d been born. \"Don\\'t you know nothin\\', butterhead?\"\\n\\n\\n From him I took it. I even waited patiently till the master spoke\\n again. The memory still makes me fry.\\n\\n\\n \"Akroida,\" he explained in his own sweet time, \"is the queen-scorp\\n of them idiotic scorpions that lives on Jupiter. I sold her the\\n Halcyon Diamond that disappeared from the World Museum five years ago,\\n remember?\" He winked broadly. \"It come from Mars in the first place,\\n you know. Mars! What a place fer jools! Damn desert\\'s lousy with \\'em,\\n if it wasn\\'t so much trouble to dig \\'em out—\" He went off into a dream\\n about the rocks on Mars but I jerked him back.\\n\\n\\n \"You mean those scorpions have really got brains?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Brains!\" he snorted. \"Have they got brains! Why, they\\'re smarter than\\n people! And not ferocious, neither, in spite of how they look, if you\\n just leave \\'em alone. That\\'s all they want, just to be left alone.\\n Peace an\\' quiet, and lots of methane and ammonia and arsenic, that\\'s\\n fer them. Besides, the space suit rig you got to wear, they can\\'t bite\\n you. Akroida\\'s not a bad old girl. Partial to arsenic on her lettuce,\\n so I brought her a hundred pounds of the stuff, an\\' she went fer that\\n almost like it was diamonds, too. Did I rate around there fer awhile!\"\\n He sighed regretfully. \"But then I went and made her mad, an\\' I\\'m kinda\\n persona non grata there right now. By the time I gnaw outa this here\\n cheese trap, though, I figger she\\'ll be all cooled off and ready fer\\n them emeralds.\"\\n\\n\\n I went back to my cot that night, and this time instead of biting my\\n nails, I bit myself. So I faced it. Casey Ritter lost his nerve, and\\n along with it, the chance of a lifetime. A better man than me had\\n already penetrated the Great Red Spot of old Jupiter and come out\\n alive. That thought ate me to the quick, and I began to wonder if it\\n was too late, after all. I could hardly wait for morning to come, so\\n that I could pry more information out of Pard Hoskins.\\n\\n\\n But I didn\\'t see Pard for a few days. And then, a week later, a group\\n of lifers made a break that didn\\'t jell, and the whole bunch was locked\\n up in the blockhouse, the special building reserved for escapees. Pard\\n Hoskins was in the bunch. He\\'d never get out of there, and he knew it.\\n So did I.\\n\\n\\n For three more days I worked down my knuckles, my nails being gone,\\n while I sat around all hunched up, wondering feverishly if Pard would\\n make a deal about those emeralds. Then I broke down and sent out a\\n letter to the S.S.C.\\n\\n\\n The Big Sneer of the conference table promptly dropped in on me,\\n friendly as a bottle of strychnine. But for a lad headed for Jupiter\\n that was good training, so I sneered right back at him, explained the\\n caper, and we both paid a visit to Pard. In two days the deal was made\\n and the caper set up. There were a few bits of info that Pard had to\\n shell out, like where the emeralds were, and how to communicate with\\n those scorpions, and how he\\'d made Akroida mad.\\n\\n\\n \"I put on a yeller slicker,\" he confessed sadly. \"That there ammonia\\n mist was eatin\\' into the finish on my spacesuit, so I draped this\\n here slicker around me to sorta fancy up the rig before goin\\' in to\\n an audience with the old rip.\" He shook his head slowly. \"The kid\\n that took me in was colorblind, so I didn\\'t have no warning at all.\\n I found out that them scorpions can\\'t stand yeller. It just plain\\n drives them nuts! Thought they\\'d chaw me up and spit me out into the\\n chlorine before I could get outa the damn thing. If my colorblind pal\\n hadn\\'t helped me, they\\'d of done it, too. And Akroida claimed I done it\\n a-purpose to upset her.\"\\n\\n\\n Then he winked at me. \"But then I got off in a corner and cooked up\\n some perfume that drives them nuts the other way; sorta frantic with\\n ecstasy, like the book says. Didn\\'t have a chance to try it on Akroida,\\n though. She wouldn\\'t give me another audience. It\\'s in the stuff they\\n cleaned outa me room: a poiple bottle with a bright green stopper.\"\\n\\n\\n He ruminated a few minutes. \"Tell you what, chump. Make them shell out\\n with a green an\\' poiple spacesuit—them\\'s the real Jupiter colors—an\\'\\n put just a touch o\\' that there perfume on the outside of it. Akroida\\'ll\\n do anything fer you if she just gets a whiff. Just anything! But\\n remember, don\\'t use but a drop. It\\'s real powerful.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Real powerful, said the man. What an understatement! But the day I was\\n set adrift in that sea of frozen ammonia clouds mixed with nice cozy\\n methane gas I sure prayed for it to be powerful, and I clutched that\\n tiny bottle like that boy Aladdin clutching his little old lamp.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d had a lot of cooperation getting that far. An Earth patrol had\\n slipped down onto the Red Desert of Mars and picked up the Killicut\\n Emeralds from where Pard Hoskins had cached them; and safe out in space\\n again, we had pored over that string of green headlights practically\\n slobbering. But the Big Sneer of the S.S.C., the fellow that had got\\n me into this caper, was right there to take the joy out of it all and\\n to remind me that this was public service, strictly.\\n\\n\\n \"These—\" he had proclaimed with a disdainful flourish, like a placer\\n miner pointing to a batch of fool\\'s gold—\"These jewels are as nothing,\\n Ritter, compared with the value of the secret you are to buy with\\n them. And be assured that if you\\'re man enough to effect the trade—\"\\n He paused, his long nose twitching cynically—\"IF you succeed, your\\n reward will be triple what you could get for them in any market. Added\\n to which, IF you succeed, you will be a free man.\"\\n\\n\\n That twitch of the nose riled me no little. \"I ain\\'t failed yet!\" I\\n snarled at him. \"Just you wait till I do, feller!\" I slipped the string\\n of emeralds back into its little safe. \"Instead of sniping at me, why\\n don\\'t you get that brain busy and set our rendezvous?\"\\n\\n\\n With that we got down to business and fixed a meeting point out on\\n Jupiter\\'s farthest moon; then they took me in to the edge of Jupiter\\'s\\n ice-cloud and turned me loose in a peanut of a space boat with old Jupe\\n looming ahead bigger than all outdoors and the Red Spot dead ahead. I\\n patted my pretty enameled suit, which was a study in paris green and\\n passionate purple.\\n\\n\\n I patted the three hundred pounds of arsenic crystals for Akroida and\\n anyone else I might have to bribe. I anxiously examined my suit\\'s air\\n and water containers and the heating unit that would keep them in\\n their proper state. I had already gone over the space boat. Yeah, I\\n was as nervous as a cat with new kittens. Feeling again for my little\\n bottle of horrid stench, I breathed a prayer to the god of idiots and\\n spacemen, and headed in. The big ship was long gone, and I felt like a\\n mighty small and naked microbe diving into the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n\\n That famous Red Spot was that big, too. It kept expanding until the\\n whole universe was a fierce, raw luminous red. Out beyond it at first\\n there had been fringes of snow-white frozen ammonia, but now it was all\\n dyed redder than Mars. Then I took the plunge right into it. Surprise!\\n The stuff was plants! Plants as big as meadows, bright red, floating\\n around in those clouds of frozen ammonia like seaweed! Then I noticed\\n that the ammonia around them wasn\\'t frozen any more and peeked at the\\n outside thermometer I couldn\\'t believe it. It was above zero. Then I\\n forgot about the temperature because it dawned on me that I was lost. I\\n couldn\\'t see a thing but drifting ammonia fog and those tangles of red\\n floating plants like little islands all around. Cutting down the motor,\\n I eased along.\\n\\n\\n But my green boat must have showed up like a lighthouse in all that\\n red, because it wasn\\'t long until I spotted a purple and green\\n hopper-scorp traveling straight toward me, sort of rowing along with\\n a pair of stubby wings. He didn\\'t seem to be making much effort, even\\n though he was climbing vertically up from the planet. In fact, he\\n didn\\'t seem to be climbing at all but just going along horizontally.\\n There just wasn\\'t any up or down in that crazy place. It must be that\\n anti-grav field, I concluded. The air was getting different, too, now\\n that I was further in. I\\'m no chemist, and I couldn\\'t have gotten out\\n there to experiment if I had been, but those plants were certainly\\n doing something to that ammonia and methane. The fog thinned, for one\\n thing, and the temperature rose to nearly forty.\\n\\n\\n Meanwhile the hopper-scorp reached the ship. Hastily I squirted some of\\n my Scorpion-Come-Hither lure on the chest of my spacesuit, opened the\\n lock, and popped out, brave as could be. Face to face with that thing,\\n though, I nearly lost my grip on the handle. In fact, I\\'d have fainted\\n dead away right there if Pard Hoskins hadn\\'t been there already and\\n lived. If that little shrimp could do it, I could, too.\\n\\n\\n I braced up and tapped out the greeting Pard had taught me. My\\n fiendish-looking opponent tapped right back, inquiring why the hell\\n I was back so soon when I knew that Akroida was all set to carve me\\n into steaks for just any meal. But the tone was friendly and even\\n intimate—or rather, the taps were. There was even a rather warm\\n expression discernible in the thing\\'s eyes, so I took heart and decided\\n to ignore the ferocious features surrounding those eyes. After all, the\\n poor sinner\\'s map was made of shell, and he wasn\\'t responsible for its\\n expression.\\n\\n\\n I tapped back very politely that he must be mistaking me for someone\\n else. \"I\\'ve never been here before, and so I\\'ve never met the charming\\n lady,\" I informed him. \"However, I have something very special in the\\n way of jewels—not with me, naturally—and the rumor is that she might\\n be interested.\"\\n\\n\\n He reared back at that, and reaching up, plucked his right eye out of\\n the socket and reeled it out to the end of a two-foot tentacle, and\\n then he examined me with it just like an old-time earl with one of\\n those things they called monocles. Pard hadn\\'t warned me about those\\n removable eyes, for reasons best known to himself. I still wake up\\n screaming....\\n\\n\\n Anyway, when that thing pulled out its eye and held it toward me, I\\n backed up against the side of the ship like I\\'d been half-electrocuted.\\n Then I gagged. But I could still remember that I had to live in that\\n suit for awhile, so I held on. Then that monstrosity reeled in the eye,\\n and I gagged again.\\n\\n\\n My actions didn\\'t bother him a bit. \"Jewels, did you say?\" he tapped\\n out thoughtfully, just like an ordinary business man, and I managed to\\n tap out yes. He drifted closer; close enough to get a whiff....\\nA shudder of ecstasy stiffened him. His head and eyes rolled with it,\\n and he wafted closer still. Right there I began to harbor a premonition\\n that there might be such a thing as being too popular in Scorpdom, but\\n I thrust this sneak-thief idea back into limbo.\\n\\n\\n Taking advantage of his condition, I boldly tapped out, \"How\\'s about\\n taking me on a guided tour through this red spinach patch to Akroida,\\n old pal?\" Or words to that effect.\\n\\n\\n He lolled his hideous cranium practically on my shoulder. \"Anything!\\n Just anything you desire, my dearest friend.\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to back off from him a bit, but the ship stopped me. \"I\\'m Casey\\n Ritter. What\\'s your label, chum?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Attaboy,\" he ticked coyly.\\n\\n\\n \"Attaboy?\" Things blurred around me. It couldn\\'t be. It was just plain\\n nuts. Then I got a glimmer through my paralyzed gray matter. \"Who named\\n you that?\"\\n\\n\\n He simpered. \"My dear friend, Pard Hoskins.\"\\n\\n\\n I breathed again. How simple could I get? He\\'d already mistaken me for\\n Pard, hadn\\'t he? Then I remembered something else. \"How come you aren\\'t\\n mad at him? Don\\'t you hate yellow, too?\"\\n\\n\\n He hung his silly head. \"I fear I am colorblind,\" he confessed sadly.\\n\\n\\n Right there I forgave him for pulling that eye on me. He was the guide\\n I needed, the one who had got Pard out alive. I almost hugged him.\\n \"Lead off, old pal,\" I sang out, and then had to tap it. \"I\\'ll follow\\n in my boat.\"\\n\\n\\n Well, I\\'d met the first of the brood and was still alive. Not only\\n alive but loved and cherished, thanks to Pard\\'s inventiveness and to\\n a kindly fate which had sent Pard\\'s old pal my way. A great man, Pard\\n Hoskins. How had he made friends with the brute in the first place?\\n\\n\\n Being once more inside my spaceboat, I raised my helmet, which was like\\n one of those head-pieces they used to put on suits of armor instead of\\n the usual plastic bubble. And it was rigged out with phony antennae and\\n mandibles and other embellishments calculated to interest my hosts.\\n Whether it interested them or not, it was plenty uncomfortable for me.\\n\\n\\n Peeking out the porthole I saw that my guide was fidgeting and looking\\n over his shoulder at my ship, so I eased in the controls and edge after\\n him. To my surprise a vapor shot out of a box that I had taken for a\\n natural lump on his back, and he darted away from me. I opened the\\n throttle and tore after him among the immense red blobs that were now\\n beginning to be patterned with dozens of green-and-purple scorpions,\\n all busy filling huge baskets with buds and tendrils, no doubt.\\n\\n\\n Other scorpions oared and floated about in twos and threes in a free\\n and peaceable manner that almost made me forget that I was scared to\\n death of them, and they stared at my boat with only a mild interest\\n that would have taught manners to most of my fellow citizens of Earth.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t until we had covered some two hundred miles of this that\\n something began to loom out of the mist, and I forgot the playboys and\\n the field workers. It loomed higher and higher. Then we burst out into\\n a clearing several miles in diameter, and I saw the structure clearly.\\n It was red, like everything else in this screwy place, and could only\\n have been built out of compressed blocks of the red plant.\\n\\n\\n In shape it was a perfect octagon. It hung poised in the center of the\\n cleared space, suspended on nothing. It had to be at least a mile in\\n diameter, and its sides were pierced with thousands of openings through\\n which its nightmare occupants appeared and disappeared, drifting in\\n and out like they had all the time in the world. I stared until my\\n eyeballs felt paralyzed.\\n\\n\\n Pard was right again. These critters had brains. And my S.S.C.\\n persecutor was right, too. That anti-grav secret was worth more than\\n any string of rocks in the system, including the Killicut Emeralds.\\n\\n\\n Then I swallowed hard. Attaboy was leading me straight across to a\\n window. Closing my helmet, my fingers fumbled badly. My brain was\\n fumbling, too. \"Zero hour, chump!\" it told me, and I shuddered. Picking\\n up the first hundred pounds of the arsenic, I wobbled over to the\\n airlock.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n That palace was like nothing on earth. Naturally, you\\'ll say, it\\'s\\n on Jupiter. But I mean it was even queerer than that. It was like no\\n building on any planet at all. And, in fact, it wasn\\'t on a planet; it\\n was floating up there only two hundred miles in from the raw edge of\\n space.\\n\\n\\n In that building everything stayed right where it was put. If it was\\n put twelve or fifty feet up off the floor, it stayed there. Not that\\n there wasn\\'t gravity. There was plenty of gravity to suit me—just\\n right, in fact—and still they had furniture sitting around in the air\\n as solid as if on a floor. Which was fine for flying hopper-scorps, but\\n what about Casey Ritter, who hadn\\'t cultivated even a feather?\\n\\n\\n Attaboy, however, had the answers for everything. Towing me from the\\n airlock to the window ledge, he again sniffed that delectable odor on\\n my chest, caressed me with his front pair of legs while I manfully\\n endured, and then without warning tossed me onto his back above the\\n little box and flew off with me along a tunnel with luminous red walls.\\n\\n\\n We finally came to the central hall of the palace, and at the sight\\n of all that space dropping away, I clutched at his shell and nearly\\n dropped the arsenic. But he didn\\'t have any brakes I could grab, so he\\n just flew out into mid-air in a room that could have swallowed a city\\n block, skyscrapers and all. It was like a mammoth red cavern, and it\\n glowed like the inside of a red light.\\n\\n\\n No wonder those scorpions like green and purple. What a relief from all\\n that red!\\n\\n\\n A patch in the middle of the hall became a floating platform holding up\\n a divan twenty feet square covered with stuff as green as new spring\\n grass, and in the center of this reclined Akroida. It had to be. Who\\n else could look like that? No one, believe me, boys and girls, no one!\\n\\n\\n Our little Akroida was a pure and peculiarly violent purple—not a\\n green edge anywhere. She was even more purple than my fancy enameled\\n space suit, and she was big enough to comfortably fill most of that\\n twenty-foot couch. To my shrinking eyes right then she looked as big as\\n a ten-ton cannon and twice as mean and dangerous. She was idly nipping\\n here and there as though she was just itching to take a hunk out of\\n somebody, and the way the servants were edging away out around her, I\\n could see they didn\\'t want to get in range. I didn\\'t blame them a bit.\\n Under the vicious sag of her Roman nose, her mandibles kept grinding,\\n shaking the jewels that were hung all over her repulsive carcass, and\\n making the Halcyon Diamond on her chest blaze like a bonfire.\\n\\n\\n Attaboy dumped me onto a floating cushion where I lay clutching and\\n shuddering away from her and from the void all around me, and went\\n across to her alone with the arsenic.\\n\\n\\n Akroida rose up sort of languidly on an elbow that was all stripped\\n bone and sharp as a needle. She pulled an eyeball out about a yard and\\n scanned Attaboy and the box. He closed in to the couch all hunched\\n over, ducked his head humbly half-a-dozen times, and pushed the box\\n over beside her. Akroida eased her eyeball back, opened the box and\\n sniffed, and then turned to Attaboy with a full-blown Satanic grin. I\\n could hear her question reverberate away over where I was.\\n\\n\\n \"Who from?\" asked Akroida.\\n\\n\\n That conversation was telegraphed to me blow by blow by the actions of\\n those hopper-scorps. I didn\\'t need their particular brand of Morse Code\\n at all.\\n\\n\\n \"Who from?\" Attaboy cringed lower and blushed a purple all-over blush.\\n \"Dear lady, it is from an interspace trader who possesses some truly\\n remarkable jewels,\" he confessed coyly.\\n\\n\\n Akroida toyed with the Halcyon Diamond and ignored the bait. \"His\\n name?\" she demanded. And when he told her, with a bad stutter in\\n his code, she reared up higher on her skinny elbow and glared in my\\n direction. \"Casey Ritter? Never heard of him. Where\\'s he from?\"\\n\\n\\n Well, after all, she wasn\\'t blind. He had to confess. \"I—uh—the\\n stones were so amazing, Royal Akroida, that I didn\\'t pay much attention\\n to the—uh—trader. He does seem to resemble an—ah—earthman.\" He\\n ducked his head and fearfully waited.\\n\\n\\n A sort of jerking quiver ran through Akroida. She reared up even\\n higher. Her mean Roman nose twitched. \"An earthman? Like Pard Hoskins?\"\\n\\n\\n Attaboy shrank smaller and smaller. He could only nod dumbly.\\n\\n\\n The storm broke, all right. That old dame let out a scream like a\\n maddened stallion and began to thrash around and flail her couch with\\n that dragon\\'s tail of hers.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

She lay quietly in the\\n other bed, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was blonde to\\n perfection, exquisitely shaped, and the rich promise of her body was\\n exposed to his view.\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\" he thought as he looked at her. \"Why did it have to happen like\\n this?\"\\n\\n\\n The whole thing was still like a dream to him, and as yet he couldn\\'t\\n decide whether it was a good or a bad dream. A year ago she had been\\n unattainable, a face to conjure with in erotic dreams, far beyond his\\n ken. A year ago she had been a public idol, the most popular actress of\\n the day. And he had been a nobody, full of a nobody\\'s idle hopes and\\n schemes.\\n\\n\\n And now he was lying in the bed next to hers in her swank Manhattan\\n apartment in the most exclusive hotel in town. The unrealness of the\\n situation overwhelmed him. His mind was a picture of confused thoughts.\\n Meanings and answers to his questions slithered out of his reach.\\n\\n\\n \"God,\" he said. It was not an exclamation, nor yet an expletive. It was\\n a mere statement of fact.\\n\\n\\n A thought teased at him. Charles looked at the woman again and decided\\n that she still looked beautiful in spite of the harshness of the\\n room\\'s lighting. He touched buttons by the edge of the bed and the\\n illumination quieted to a soft glow, wrapping her in a radiant halo.\\n Charles smiled wanly and got up. He stood by the bed looking at her.\\n\\n\\n \"I could have fallen in love with you once. A year ago, perhaps, or\\n longer. But not now. Not now.\" He turned away and walked to the window.\\n \"Now the world is dead. The whole world is dead.\"\\n\\n\\n New York lay quietly below him. It was the hour of indecision when\\n day has not quite made up its mind to leave and night has not yet\\n attacked in force. The streetlights were already on, making geometric\\n patterns through the dusk of Central Park. Some of the billboards were\\n shining, their relays activated by darkness-sensitized solenoids. A\\n reddish-orange pallor hung from the sky.\\n\\n\\n It had been very pleasant that afternoon. She had given of herself\\n freely, warmly, and Charles had accepted. But then he had known\\n that she would. It was not him, it was the circumstances. Under the\\n circumstances, she would have given herself to any man—\\n\\n\\n \"Why did it have to be her—or me? Why should it have to happen to\\n anybody! Why!\"\\nShe would have given herself to any man—\\nHis thoughts beat a rapid crescendo, activating emotions, stimulating\\n sensations of angry rage. He wanted to cry, to weep angry tears of\\n protest.\\n\\n\\n To any man, WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST MAN ON EARTH!\\n\\n\\n Charles picked up a heavy book end off the table and crashed it through\\n the thick pane of window glass.\\n\\n\\n A gust of wind from the outside breezed through the shattered opening,\\n attacking his olfactory patch with the retching smell of decaying\\n flesh. Charles ignored it. Even smells had lost their customary\\n meanings.\\n\\n\\n He felt the rage build up inside again, tearing at his viscera. His\\n stomach clenched up like an angry fist.\\n\\n\\n \"But I don\\'t want to be the last man alive!\" he shouted. \"I don\\'t know\\n what to do! I don\\'t know where to go, how to act! I just don\\'t know—\"\\n\\n\\n A paroxysm of sobbing shook his body. Trembling, he dropped to his\\n knees, his head against the cold firmness of the sill, his hands\\n clutched tightly around the jagged edges of the window pane. In spite\\n of the sharp pain that raced through his system, in spite of the\\n bright, warm, red stream that trickled down his face, he knelt by the\\n window for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMaybe I\\'m not the last!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n The thought struck him with suddenness, promisingly, edged with\\n swelling comfort to fill his emptiness.\\n\\n\\n Charles got up slowly, noticing for the first time that his fingers\\n were badly cut. He wrapped a handkerchief around them and forgot them.\\n He had to know—he had to find out.\\nAs he turned to leave, he noticed again the woman lying in radiant\\n state upon the bed. He walked to her side and leaned over, kissing her\\n gently on the forehead. As he straightened up, his leg caught against\\n her arm, pushing it slightly. The woman\\'s arm slipped from its position\\n and dangled from the edge of the bed like a crazy pendulum. Charles\\n picked it up and folded it across her now cold breasts. He started\\n to pull the sheet over her nude form, then stopped, smiling at his\\n conventionality. After all, it didn\\'t make any difference now.\\n\\n\\n The phonograph was near the door. On sudden impulse he switched it\\n on, turned the volume up full, and in grim jest left it playing\\n Rachmaninoff\\'s\\nIsle of the Dead\\non full automatic. The music haunted\\n him down the hall to the elevator that he had to run himself.\\n\\n\\n The lobby was littered with debris, human and otherwise. Charles\\n ignored it. The street that led towards the Bureau of Vital Statistics\\n was a mess of desolate carnage. Charles overlooked it. Shop fronts\\n smashed, stores looted, gyro-cars wrecked, proud buildings defaced.\\n\\n\\n \"That was it,\" he said to himself. \"Pride. We called this the \\'Proud\\n Era.\\' Everything was better and bigger and nicer to have. Buildings\\n were taller, men were healthier, most of the problems of humanity\\n seemed licked, or nearly so. It was a time of free power, each small\\n unit of population, each section of town operating on perpetual,\\n ever-lasting, automatic atomic piles.\\n\\n\\n \"We were free. We seemed, almost, to have accomplished something. The\\n world was running well. No wonder we called it the \\'Proud Era.\\' Life\\n was fun, just a bowl of cherries, until....\"\\n\\n\\n Two years ago the animals had started dying. Strangely enough the\\n rats had gone first, to anybody\\'s notice. Sales of poison dropped,\\n scientific laboratories chained to a perpetual rodent-cycle began to\\n complain bitterly.\\n\\n\\n Then the lovers who hunted out and haunted the lonely lanes through the\\n countryside began to remark that the locusts were late that year. The\\n Southern states joyously reported that mosquito control was working to\\n an unprecedented degree. The largest cotton crop ever was forecast and\\n rumors from Mexico had it that no one had died from scorpion bite in\\n several weeks.\\n\\n\\n A month later the meat animals, the birds and the household pets\\n began dropping as rapidly as the flies which had dropped earlier.\\n Congress was called into special session, as were all of the national\\n governments around the world. The U.N. met at emergency sessions to\\n cope with the situation. The president of the world-wide Society for\\n the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals committed suicide.\\n\\n\\n Within a year it was obvious to everyone that man was the only animal\\n left on earth.\\n\\n\\n The panic which had begun with the death of the animals was quieted\\n somewhat by the fact that humans seemed immune to the pandemic. But the\\n lakes full of dead fish caused a great stink and residents along the\\n coasts began to move inland. Sales of perfumes and deodorants soared.\\n\\n\\n Then just one year ago, the first human became infected with the\\n strange malady. Within six months, half of the world\\'s population was\\n gone. Less than a month ago no more than a few thousand people remained\\n in New York. And now....\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got to find out,\" Charles told himself. He meant it, of course,\\n but in a sense he was afraid—afraid that his trip to the Bureau might\\n give him an answer he didn\\'t dare listen to. \"But I\\'ve got to try.\" He\\n walked on down the bloody street.\\n\\n\\n Before the plague the Bureau of Vital Statistics had been one of man\\'s\\n crowning achievements. Housed as it was in a huge metallic globe of\\n a building, it contained computers which kept exact account of every\\n human on earth.\\n\\n\\n Compulsory registration and the classification of each individual by\\n means of the discrete patterns of his brain waves had accomplished for\\n man what no ordinary census could have. The machine knew who was alive,\\n who was dead, and where everybody was.\\n\\n\\n Once a year the Bureau issued The Index, an exact accounting of Earth\\'s\\n four billion inhabitants. Four billion names and addresses, compressed\\n into microprint, a tremendous achievement even for the \"Proud Era.\"\\n In all of his life, Charles had never once glanced at The Index.\\n The average person had little necessity to do so since the Bureau\\n information service would answer questions free of charge at any time.\\n\\n\\n Reaching the gigantic building, Charles pushed aside the body of a\\n young man and walked into the main foyer. Passing behind once-guarded\\n doors, he entered the giant computer room and paused in admiration.\\nOnly once, before the plague, had he seen the interior of this room.\\n But he still remembered it and he still recalled the powerful emotional\\n experience it had been those many years ago.\\n\\n\\n All children had to have a brain-wave recording made by the Bureau\\n during the first month of their life. And again at the age of 10 each\\n child returned to the Bureau for a recheck. It was for this latter\\n recording that Charles had come to the Bureau some twenty-two years\\n before and a friendly guard had let him peep briefly into the computer\\n room. The impression of intense activity, of organized confusion, of\\n mechanical wonder had remained with him the rest of his life.\\n\\n\\n \"So different now,\" he thought, surveying the room. \"Now it\\'s empty, so\\n empty.\" The machine seemed to reflect the stillness, the very deadness\\n of the world. The silence became unbearable.\\n\\n\\n Charles walked to the master control panel. With newly acquired\\n dexterity he switched the computer screens on and watched them glow\\n to life. All around the world sensitive receiving stations pulsed to\\n activity, sending out searching fingers, hunting for elusive patterns\\n of neutral energy, mapping and tabulating the results.\\n\\n\\n The main computer screen dominated one wall of the room. Other smaller\\n screens clustered around it. On these screens could be graphed the\\n population of any and every part of the globe. An illuminated counter\\n immediately above it would give the numerical strength of the area\\n being sampled while the screen would show population density by\\n individual pinpoints of light that merged to form brightness patterns.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll try New York first,\" he said to himself, knowing that he was a\\n coward, afraid to check the whole world from the start. \"I\\'ll start\\n with New York and work up.\"\\n\\n\\n Charles activated the switches that would flash a schematic map of New\\n York on the screen. \"There\\'s bound to be somebody else left here. After\\n all, there were at least twenty of us just a couple of days ago.\" And\\n one of them, a beautiful woman, had invited him up to her apartment,\\n not because she liked him, but because....\\n\\n\\n The main screen focused itself, the patterns shifting into a\\n recognizable perceptual image.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, it was just yesterday \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mor was it the day before?\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m that ten of\\n us, at least, met here to check the figures. There were lots of us\\n alive then.\" Including the blond young woman who had died just this\\n afternoon....\\n\\n\\n Charles stopped talking and forced his eyes upwards. Peripheral vision\\n caught first the vague outlines of the lower part of the map. His eyes\\n continued to move, slowly, reluctantly. They caught the over-all relief\\n of Greater New York City—and then concentrated on the single, shining\\n dot at the very heart of the map—and he understood.\\n\\n\\n His eyes stabbed quickly for the counter above the screen.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n He gasped.\\n\\n\\n The counter read\\none\\n.\\n\\n\\n Charles was by himself, the last person alive in all of New York City.\\n\\n\\n He began to tremble violently. The silence of the room began to press\\n quickly in on him. His frantic fingers searched for the computer\\n controls.\\n\\n\\n New York State. One.\\n\\n\\n The entire United States. One.\\n\\n\\n The western hemisphere, including islands.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mWas that a point of light in Brazil? No. Just a ghost image\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n The Pacific area, Asia, Australia, Asia Minor, Russia and the Near\\n East, Africa and then Europe.\\n\\n\\n England!\\n\\n\\n There was a light in England! Someone else still lived! The counter\\n clicked forward.\\n\\n\\n Two!\\n\\n\\n His trembling stopped. He breathed again.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. London was at least as populous as New York City before the\\n plague. It\\'s only logical that—\"\\n\\n\\n He stopped. For even as he spoke, the light winked out! The counter\\n clicked again.\\n\\n\\n One.\\n\\n\\n Alone.\\n\\n\\n Alone!\\n\\n\\n Charles screamed.\\n\\n\\n The bottom dropped out from under him!\\nWhy?\\n\\n\\n Such a simple question, but in those three letters lay the essence of\\n human nature. Why. The drive of curiosity. Stronger, in a way, than\\n the so-called \"basic\" drives: hunger, thirst, sex, shelter, warmth,\\n companionship, elimination. Certainly more decisive in the history of\\n the race. Man began to think, to differentiate himself from the other\\n animals, when he first asked the question: \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n But thinking about \"why\" didn\\'t answer the question itself, Charles\\n thought. He looked around him. He was sitting on a bench in Central\\n Park, alone except for a few stray corpses. But the park was fairly\\n free of bodies.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got about ten minutes warning,\" he said to himself. \"I guess\\n that most people wanted to die inside of something—inside of anything.\\n Not out in the unprotected open.\"\\n\\n\\n The silence was like a weight hanging around his neck. Not an insect\\n noise, not the chirp of a bird, not the sound of a car nor the scream\\n of a plane. Not even a breeze to whisper among the leaves, he thought.\\n Civilization equals life equals noise. Silence equals....\\n\\n\\n Why. His mind kept returning to the question. Of all the people on\\n earth, me. The last. Why me?\\n\\n\\n Average, that\\'s what he was. Height: 5\\'11\". Weight: 165. Age: 32.\\n Status: Married, once upon a time.\\n\\n\\n The Norm, with no significant departures, all down the line. Church\\n member, but not a good one. Could that be it? Could the most normal be\\n the most perfect? Had he led the best of all possible lives? Was that\\n it? Had God, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, spared his life, saved\\n him, singled him out because he was most nearly a saint, most nearly\\n Christ-like, most nearly....\\n\\n\\n Lies—His mind snapped back to reality. He half smiled. Saint? Christ?\\n The Second Coming?\\n\\n\\n He was no saint.\\n\\n\\n Charles sighed.\\n\\n\\n What about—?\\nChance. That was it! The laws of probability, the bell-shaped curve,\\n normal distribution, rectilinear regression. More people per square\\n foot in New York than elsewhere. The first person who died was from New\\n York, so the last person who gave way to the disease should come from\\n here too. Spin the wheel; throw the dice; toss the coin.\\n\\n\\n So simple to explain by the laws of chance. No need for any underlying\\n assumptions about good and evil, no need for teleological arguments\\n concerning cause and effect. Simply explain it by chance. Somebody had\\n to be the last to go and that was—\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Charles said, standing up in the quiet of the spring evening.\\n \"No, chance won\\'t do it. No man can reckon with chance. The mind\\n rejects such things. There must be something beyond mere accident.\\n There must be!\"\\n\\n\\n He sighed slowly.\\n\\n\\n \"So now I\\'m a hermit, whether or not I like it,\" he said in derision to\\n the gravel path as he walked along it. \"A hermit in the midst of a city\\n of millions of—No, I forgot. There aren\\'t any more people, are there?\"\\n It was hard to realize, even now. \"A hermit, alone—and I haven\\'t even\\n got a cave....\"\\n\\n\\n Charles stopped walking suddenly. No cave, he thought. No place to\\n sleep out the long one, no place to rest while time came to change\\n things around and make them for the better. No place to hide.\\n\\n\\n And suddenly it was the most important thing in life to him to find his\\n \"cave.\"\\n\\n\\n It took him almost an hour to find the proper tools, and better than\\n two hours more of hard, nighttime work to get the hole dug to his\\n satisfaction. It took almost three hours to find the right sort of\\n casket, durable but not too heavy for one man to handle. He carted it\\n out to a grassy plot close to the center of the park where the grave\\n was. He let the coffin down slowly into the depression, then piled up\\n loose dirt on the sloping sides of the hole so that the rain would wash\\n it down over him.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t very well bury myself,\" he said. \"I guess it will rain after\\n I\\'m gone.\" He looked carefully down at the metallic container.\\n\\n\\n Wait now. There was something wrong, something missing. It was—oh,\\n yes, he caught it. It was the stone. There wasn\\'t any stone to go at\\n the head of the grave. \"I\\'ll have to fix that.\"\\n\\n\\n A sheet of metal, bent double, served for the monument proper. A nearby\\n tool shed yielded up a can of paint and a brush. By the glow of one of\\n the streetlights Charles worked out the inscription.\\n\\n\\n \"It ought to be something impressive,\" he thought out loud. \"Something\\n fitting the occasion.\"\\n\\n\\n What did one say on these situations? There was so little chance to\\n practice up for things like this. But it ought to be good, it ought to\\n be proper.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'In this now hallowed corner of the planet Earth—\\' No. That sounds\\n too ... too....\"\\n\\n\\n Make it simple, he thought. And he finally wrote:\\nHERE LIES THE BODY OF\\n\\n THE LAST MAN ON EARTH\\n\\n\\n Yes. That was it. Simple. Let whoever came afterwards figure out the\\n rest. Let them decide. He smiled and finished the painting.\\n\\n\\n Charles was hungry. He got up and started for one of the restaurants\\n near the park. Later on, when there was more time, he\\'d find a piece\\n of granite and move it to the plot. He could spend his free time\\n carving on it, copying the inscription. He would make it into a real\\n shrine; maybe he would practice up a bit and try to carve a statue to\\n go with the stone.\\n\\n\\n Somehow, though, since things were ready and it didn\\'t make too much\\n difference, it seemed to Charles that he\\'d probably have a long time\\n to wait. \"Maybe it\\'s just a disease, and I\\'m immune. I was immune to\\n smallpox. The vaccination never took. That\\'s probably it.\"\\n\\n\\n He smiled. Strange, but now he wanted very much to go on living,\\n alone or not. There were things he could do, ways to keep occupied.\\n He wouldn\\'t mind it so much. But he wanted more and more desperately\\n with each passing second to retain his foothold on the tenuous path of\\n physical existence.\\n\\n\\n The tantalizing thought of \"why\" puzzled its way back into his mind.\\n But it seemed less pressing now that he had almost come to the\\n conclusion that he would live for a long time. Later, in a few days\\n perhaps, he would think about it. In a little while he\\'d have plenty of\\n opportunity for hunting down the answer. This seemed good to him, for\\n now he thought he almost had the answer, if there were an answer. He\\n thought he had seen the solution peering out at him from the recesses\\n of his mind, and he didn\\'t like the expression on its face. Better to\\n forget.\\nCharles reached the broad boulevard. There was a large cafe just across\\n from him, its front window caved in by a large truck. He stumbled and\\n almost fell as he stepped from the curb.\\n\\n\\n \"Look at me, nervous as a cat.\"\\n\\n\\n He was trembling noticeably as he started across the street.\\n\\n\\n \"I—\" He started to say something, to think something. But some hidden\\n part of his mind clamped down, obscuring the thought, rejecting the\\n concept.\\n\\n\\n The tremor turned to a shake before he reached the far curb, and the\\n first burst of wild pain came as he laid his shoulder against the door\\n to the restaurant. This was the way the plague began, but—His mind\\n quickly repressed the idea. It couldn\\'t be the plague. He was immune!\\n\\n\\n Another burst of pulsating, shattering pain crashed through his body,\\n tearing down the defenses of his mind, putting an end of his thoughts\\n of immunity. Colors flared before his eyes, a persistent, irresistible\\n susurrus flooded his ears.\\n\\n\\n He wanted to protest, but there was no one to listen to him. He\\n appealed to every divinity he knew, all the time knowing it would be\\n useless. His body, out of his voluntary control, tried to run off in\\n all directions at once.\\n\\n\\n Charles struggled to end his body\\'s disorganized responses, to\\n channelize all his energy into one direction. His mind came back into\\n action. He set up his goal; everything else seemed irrelevant: he had\\n to get back to the park, to his hermit\\'s cave, to his long, narrow\\n home. He couldn\\'t die until then.\\n\\n\\n Ten minutes.\\n\\n\\n He was allotted ten minutes before the end.\\n\\n\\n It could have been ten years or ten seconds, for now objective time\\n meant nothing to him. It was not a matter of measuring seconds and\\n minutes. It was a matter of forgetting time and measuring space.\\n\\n\\n He concentrated on the grave; he forced his body to become an unwilling\\n machine. While he could, he walked, forcing himself on. When his legs\\n gave way, he crawled. When his knees buckled, he rolled. When his\\n stomach protested, he vomited. It made no difference.\\n\\n\\n Charles refused to think. Machines, especially half-broken machines, do\\n not think; they only work. Sweating, straining, bleeding, retching, he\\n pushed himself towards his goal, trying to add one final touch of grace\\n and custom to the rude irrationalness of it all.\\n\\n\\n His eyes gave out a few feet from the pit. He felt his way towards it.\\n Convulsions shook his body like a cat shakes a captive mouse. He humped\\n his body forward between the seizures, hands outstretched, searching\\n for the grave.\\n\\n\\n And then he was upon it. One arm reached out for grass, and clutched\\n bare space instead.\\n\\n\\n He was home.\\n\\n\\n He gathered energy from his final reservoirs of strength for one final\\n movement that would throw him headlong into the shallow grave. He\\n tensed his muscles, pulled his limbs up under him and started to roll\\n into the hole.\\n\\n\\n Instantly the thought struck him with paralyzing devastation. The\\n answer to it all poked its face out from the recesses of his mind and\\n sapped the last bit of his energy, corroding his nerves and dying\\n muscles. Now he knew, and the knowing was the end of it.\\n\\n\\n He collapsed at the edge of the pit. Only one arm hung loosely down\\n into it, swinging senseless in the air, pointing accusingly at the\\n empty coffin.\\n\\n\\n The world will end, not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with the\\n last man\\'s anguished cry at the unreasonableness of it all.\\n\\n\\n Charles screamed.\\nThe large, invisible, ovular being that hung suspended over the Empire\\n State Building rested from its exertion. Soon it was approached by\\n another of its kind.\\n\\n\\n \"It is finished?\" asked the second.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Just now. I am resting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can feel the emptiness of it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was very good. Where were you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"On the next planet out. No beauty to it at all; no system. How was\\n yours?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beautiful,\" said the first. \"It went according to the strictest\\n semantic relationship following the purest mathematical principles.\\n They made it easy for me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, where to now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s another system about four thoughts away. We\\'re due there soon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right. Let\\'s go.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that you have there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, this?\" replied the first. \"It\\'s a higher neural order compendium\\n the Things here made up. It\\'s what I used.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t take it with you, you know. They don\\'t allow souvenirs.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, all right. You\\'re so good, see if you can compute the\\n scatter probability.\"\\n\\n\\n The first being moved imperceptably and the heavy plastoid binding of\\n the book disappeared. The thousands of pages dropped softly, caught\\n at the wind like hungry sails, separated, and pulled by the fingers of\\n gravity, went their disparate ways.\\nHere a page scuttled into a broken window of the Chrysler Building\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Aabat, Aabbs, Aabbt\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n Here a page landed upright on the head of one of the library lions\\n and sloughed softly to the ground \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Looman, Loomana,\\n Loomanabsky\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n Here another page crept in between the cracks of a pier on the\\n riverfront, dropping gently to the caressing eddies of the water \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread\\n the names: Smith, Smitha, Smitj\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n And here two pages danced down into Central Park, pirouetted,\\n promenaded, and finally came to rest against a propped-up piece of\\n metal \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mread the names: Whit, Whita, Whitacomb\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n It was not until the dusty morning sun stirred up the breezes that they\\n fluttered down into the shallow hole beneath, unnoticed.

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\\n lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\\n turned.\\n\\n\\n \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\\n\\n\\n The OD nodded. \"I\\'ll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\\n \"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\\n ready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \"\\nIf\\nthey come back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is there any question?\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec shrugged. \"I don\\'t know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny\\n place. I don\\'t trust the natives.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they\\'re human beings,\\n just like us—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don\\'t\\n even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don\\'t like them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate\\n themselves to Venus\\'s climate. They\\'re friendly enough.\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\\n outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\\n Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\\n the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\\n proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\\n wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\\n guards.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there\\'s a minority who are afraid\\n of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\\n They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\\n know Venus is habitable. And there\\'s some sort of a paltry underground\\n group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\\n native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that\\n is—right down into the mud. Well—\" he laughed—\"maybe they will.\\n After all, the fittest survive. That\\'s a basic law of—\"\\n\\n\\n The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\\n voice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\\n reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\\n stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\\n enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He\\n snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\\n \"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\\n even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\\n and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\\n\\n\\n The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\\n\"You see?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\\n others in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\\n their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\\n\\n\\n The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\\n spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\\n head. \"Svan, I\\'m afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\\n is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\\n trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan laughed harshly. \"\\nThey\\ndon\\'t think so. You heard them. We are\\n not human any more. The officer said it.\"\\n\\n\\n The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\\n agreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\\n around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\\n convinced by Svan.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\\n assent.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\\n alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\\n Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\\n return.\"\\n\\n\\n An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\\n complained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\\n authorized—murder?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\\n Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\\n Earth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\\n dull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\\n feet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\\n ship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the\\n surface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty\\n hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\\n faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty,\\n irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\\n off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\\n mark on one of them, held it up.\\n\\n\\n \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\\n there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\\n\\n\\n No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\\n bowl.\"\\n\\n\\n Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\\n of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\\n left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\\n creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\\n with his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\\n and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\\n himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\\n slips.\\n\\n\\n Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\\n \"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\\n car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city\\n has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\\n find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\\n The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\\n car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\\n guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough,\\n after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that\\'s all there is to\\n it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\\n of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\\n dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\\n from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\\n\\n\\n There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\\n uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\\n\\n\\n Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\\n Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\\n striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\\n\\n\\n And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second\\'s\\n glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\\n Almost he was disappointed.\\n\\n\\n Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\\n up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\\n one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....\\n\\n\\n Then gray understanding came to him.\\nA traitor!\\nhis subconscious\\n whispered.\\nA coward!\\nHe stared at them in a new light, saw their\\n indecision magnified, became opposition.\\n\\n\\n Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\\n coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\\n be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\\n every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\\n of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\\n Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\\n beneath the table, marked his own slip.\\n\\n\\n In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\\n secret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\\nThe six conspirators in Svan\\'s old ground car moved slowly along the\\n main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except\\n for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the\\n entrance to the town\\'s Hall of Justice.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We\\n have ample time.\"\\n\\n\\n He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching\\n the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.\\n Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?\\n\\n\\n The right answer leaped up at him.\\nThey all are\\n, he thought.\\nNot one\\n of them understands what this means. They\\'re afraid.\\nHe clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was\\n driving. \"Let\\'s get this done with.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her\\n eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy\\n car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite\\n dark now. The car\\'s driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,\\n illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the\\n jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The\\n present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off\\n again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\\n\\n\\n A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence\\n that followed its thunderous crash, a man\\'s voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the\\n brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them\\n from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\\n\\n\\n Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened\\n the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard\\n it was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is\\n that not permitted?\"\\n\\n\\n The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The\\n order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It\\n is urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a\\n complicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\\n Confusion furrowed the guard\\'s hairless brows, then was replaced by\\n a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\\n \"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\"\\n He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was\\n faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.\\n He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against\\n the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan\\n savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like\\n nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength\\n in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial\\n advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard\\n lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had\\n ruthlessly pounded it against the road.\\nSvan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\\nSvan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the\\n petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,\\n then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over\\n the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the\\n jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be\\n no trace.\\n\\n\\n Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now\\n there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep\\n a watch for other guards.\"\\nVenus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.\\n Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow\\n of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away\\n at the computer\\'s table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of\\n course, you can\\'t tell. Might be a raiding party.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no\\n answer in his stolid face. \"Don\\'t joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose\\n something happens to the delegation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then we\\'re in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you\\n the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They\\'ve been prohibited for the\\n last three hundred years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they\\'ve doubled the\\n guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they\\n know how. You heard the delegation\\'s report on the intercom. It\\'s this\\n secret group they call the Council.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And how do you know the guards themselves don\\'t belong to it?\" the\\n Exec retorted. \"They\\'re all the same to me.... Look, your light\\'s gone\\n out now. Must have been the guard. They\\'re on the wrong side to be\\n coming from the town, anyhow....\"\\nSvan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the\\n lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment\\n under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get\\n the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.\\n Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been\\ntwo\\nbombs in\\n the compartment, though Svan\\'s hand emerged with only one.\\n\\n\\n He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he\\n said. \"They won\\'t be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we\\n were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\"\\n\\n\\n Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back\\n again,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car\\n into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan, listening, thought:\\nIt\\'s not much of a plan. The guards would\\n not be drawn away. I am glad I can\\'t trust these five any more. If\\n they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a\\n purpose.\\nAloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the\\n city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because\\n the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,\\n you are in no danger from the guards.\"\\nFrom the guards\\n, his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would\\n feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in\\n that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a\\n ground-shaking crash.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting\\n off the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached\\n for him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of\\n the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,\\n sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few\\n hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.\\n\\n\\n Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?\\n Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?\\n\\n\\n There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was\\n driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And\\n since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked\\n slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\\n\\n\\n He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the\\n jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed\\n lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by\\n its own fierce rockets. Svan\\'s mist-trained eyes spotted the circling\\n figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship\\'s own.\\n They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those\\n slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the\\n side of the ship.\\n\\n\\n Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.\\n He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went\\n absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He\\n turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first\\n cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?\\nHe became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car\\n was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare\\n of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.\\n\\n\\n Paralyzed, he heard the girl\\'s voice. \"Svan! They\\'re coming! They found\\n the guard\\'s rifle, and they\\'re looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,\\n with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came\\n for you. We must flee!\"\\n\\n\\n He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly.\\n Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb\\n in the car—\\n\\n\\n \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and\\n swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before\\n something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted\\n from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force\\n onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the\\n sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to\\n feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\\n\\n\\n The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He\\'s still alive,\" he said\\n callously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won\\'t last long, though.\\n What\\'ve you got there?\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two\\n halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a\\n connection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type,\\n delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,\\n and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won\\'t do any bombing\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.\\n The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It\\'s poetic justice if I ever saw it.\\n They had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of\\n paper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don\\'t get,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on\\n it? What about it?\"\\n\\n\\n The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had\\n the devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over\\n slowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be\\n doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Just before the silence grew\\n awkward, Magnan went on.\\n\\n\\n \"There are four planets in the group,\" he said. \"Two double planets,\\n all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They\\'re\\n called Jorgensen\\'s Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance\\n whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti\\n have been penetrating.\\n\\n\\n \"Now—\" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—\"we have learned\\n that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they\\'ve met no\\n opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they\\n intend to seize Jorgensen\\'s Worlds by force.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief\\'s reaction. Retief drew\\n carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.\\n\\n\\n \"This is open aggression, Retief,\" he said, \"in case I haven\\'t made\\n myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien\\n species. Obviously, we can\\'t allow it.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.\\n\\n\\n \"A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,\\n Jorgensen\\'s Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They\\'re\\n farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in\\n their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war\\n potential, by conventional standards, is nil.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan tapped the folder before him.\\n\\n\\n \"I have here,\" he said solemnly, \"information which will change that\\n picture completely.\" He leaned back and blinked at Retief.\\n\"All right, Mr. Councillor,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ll play along; what\\'s in\\n the folder?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down.\\n\\n\\n \"First,\" he said. \"The Soetti War Plan—in detail. We were fortunate\\n enough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegade\\n Terrestrials who\\'ve been advising the Soetti.\" He folded another\\n finger. \"Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen\\'s people, worked out by\\n the Theory group.\" He wrestled a third finger down. \"Lastly; an Utter\\n Top Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-acceleration\\n field into a potent weapon—a development our systems people have been\\n holding in reserve for just such a situation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that all?\" Retief said. \"You\\'ve still got two fingers sticking up.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away.\\n\\n\\n \"This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, this\\n information could be catastrophic. You\\'ll memorize it before you leave\\n this building.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll carry it, sealed,\" Retief said. \"That way nobody can sweat it out\\n of me.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan started to shake his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said. \"If it\\'s trapped for destruction, I suppose—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve heard of these Jorgensen\\'s Worlds,\" Retief said. \"I remember an\\n agent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard with\\n cards and dice. Never played for money, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Umm,\" Magnan said. \"Don\\'t make the error of personalizing this\\n situation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of these\\n backwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow its\\n natural course, as always.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When does this attack happen?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Less than four weeks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That doesn\\'t leave me much time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far as\\n Aldo Cerise. You\\'ll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the rest\\n of the way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don\\'t make it?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked sour. \"Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to put\\n all our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you is\\n not misplaced.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This antiac conversion; how long does it take?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. The\\n Jorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic of\\n some sort.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the tickets\\n inside.\\n\\n\\n \"Less than four hours to departure time,\" he said. \"I\\'d better not\\n start any long books.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination,\" Magnan\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Retief stood up. \"If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The allusion escapes me,\" Magnan said coldly. \"And one last word. The\\n Soetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen\\'s Worlds; don\\'t\\n get yourself interned.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll tell you what,\" Retief said soberly. \"In a pinch, I\\'ll mention\\n your name.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll be traveling with Class X credentials,\" Magnan snapped. \"There\\n must be nothing to connect you with the Corps.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll never guess,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ll pose as a gentleman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better be getting started,\" Magnan said, shuffling papers.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right,\" Retief said. \"If I work at it, I might manage a\\n snootful by takeoff.\" He went to the door. \"No objection to my checking\\n out a needler, is there?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked up. \"I suppose not. What do you want with it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a feeling I\\'ve got.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some day,\" Retief said, \"I may take you up on that.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on the\\n counter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legend\\n \"ALDO CERISE—INTERPLANETARY.\" A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouse\\n and a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watching\\n Retief from the corner of his eye.\\n\\n\\n Retief glanced at him.\\n\\n\\n The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth and\\n spat it on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Was there something?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group,\" Retief said.\\n \"Is it on schedule?\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. \"Filled\\n up. Try again in a couple of weeks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What time does it leave?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s stick to facts,\" Retief said. \"Don\\'t try to think. What time is\\n it due out?\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk smiled pityingly. \"It\\'s my lunch hour,\" he said. \"I\\'ll be\\n open in an hour.\" He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.\\n\\n\\n \"If I have to come around this counter,\" Retief said, \"I\\'ll feed that\\n thumb to you the hard way.\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief\\'s eye,\\n closed his mouth and swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"Like it says there,\" he said, jerking a thumb at the board. \"Lifts in\\n an hour. But you won\\'t be on it,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at him.\\n\\n\\n \"Some ... ah ... VIP\\'s required accommodation,\" he said. He hooked\\n a finger inside the sequined collar. \"All tourist reservations were\\n canceled. You\\'ll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship\\n next—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Which gate?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"For ... ah...?\"\\n\\n\\n \"For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen\\'s Worlds,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the clerk said. \"Gate 19,\" he added quickly. \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign\\n reading\\nTo Gates 16-30\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"Another smart alec,\" the clerk said behind him.\\nRetief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\\n covered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\\n with a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\\n gray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\\n\\n\\n \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\n Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\\n\\n\\n The guard blinked at it.\\n\\n\\n \"Whassat?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\\n says he\\'s out to lunch.\"\\n\\n\\n The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\\n against the handrail.\\n\\n\\n \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\\n right into the guard\\'s midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\\n went to his knees.\\n\\n\\n \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn\\'t resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\\n past while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\\n over the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\\n\\n\\n A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\\n\\n\\n \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\\n along the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\\n The door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\\n floor. It was expensive looking baggage.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\\n florid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\\n the open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\\n clamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Somebody in the cabin. Get \\'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\\n he backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\\n\\n\\n \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony\\'s room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\\n out of here, fellow! You\\'re keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it\\'s Mr.\\n Tony\\'s room.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know Mr. Tony. He\\'ll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\\n sat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\\n the corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\\n oversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\\n glanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\\n out?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\\n handle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\\n the trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\\n far wall of the corridor and burst.\\n\\n\\n Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\\n face of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\\n\\n\\n \"Mister, you must be—\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'ll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\\n the door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\\nFive minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a\\n blue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye\\n stared at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"Is this the joker?\" he grated.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,\\n \"That\\'s him, sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m captain of this vessel,\" the first man said. \"You\\'ve got two\\n minutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When you can spare the time from your other duties,\" Retief said,\\n \"take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code.\\n That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in\\n interplanetary commerce.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A space lawyer.\" The captain turned. \"Throw him out, boys.\"\\n\\n\\n Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on, pitch him out,\" the captain snapped.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t try it,\" he said softly.\\n\\n\\n One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and\\n stepped forward, then hesitated.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he said. \"This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s him,\" the thick-necked man called. \"Spilled Mr. Tony\\'s\\n possessions right on the deck.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Deal me out,\" the bouncer said. \"He can stay put as long as he wants\\n to. I signed on to move cargo. Let\\'s go, Moe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,\" Retief said.\\n \"We\\'re due to lift in twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The\\n Captain\\'s voice prevailed.\\n\\n\\n \"—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Close the door as you leave,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man paused at the door. \"We\\'ll see you when you come\\n out.\"\\nIII\\n\\n\\n Four waiters passed Retief\\'s table without stopping. A fifth leaned\\n against the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.\\n\\n\\n At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform\\n and with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male\\n passengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional\\n glances Retief\\'s way.\\n\\n\\n A panel opened in the wall behind Retief\\'s chair. Bright blue eyes\\n peered out from under a white chef\\'s cap.\\n\\n\\n \"Givin\\' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Looks like it, old-timer,\" Retief said. \"Maybe I\\'d better go join the\\n skipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see your point.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You set right where you\\'re at, Mister. I\\'ll rustle you up a plate.\"\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed\\n up with mushrooms and garlic butter.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Chip,\" the chef said. \"I don\\'t like the Cap\\'n. You can tell him I\\n said so. Don\\'t like his friends, either. Don\\'t like them dern Sweaties,\\n look at a man like he was a worm.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you\\'ve got the\\n right idea on the Soetti, too,\" Retief said. He poured red wine into a\\n glass. \"Here\\'s to you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dern right,\" Chip said. \"Dunno who ever thought up broiling \\'em.\\n Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert.\\n You like brandy in yer coffee?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Chip, you\\'re a genius.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like to see a feller eat,\" Chip said. \"I gotta go now. If you need\\n anything, holler.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to\\n Jorgensen\\'s Worlds. Then, if Magnan\\'s information was correct,\\n there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a\\n temptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It\\n would be good to know what Jorgensen\\'s Worlds would be up against.\\n\\n\\n Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and\\n coffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony\\n and his retainers still sat at the Captain\\'s table.\\n\\n\\n As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across\\n the room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took\\n a cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted\\n end in Retief\\'s coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.\\n\\n\\n The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.\\n\\n\\n \"You must want to get to Jorgensen\\'s pretty bad,\" the thug said in a\\n grating voice. \"What\\'s your game, hick?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I want my coffee,\" he said. He looked at the thug. \"You\\n drink it.\"\\n\\n\\n The thug squinted at Retief. \"A wise hick,\" he began.\\n\\n\\n With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug\\'s\\n face, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug\\n went down.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.\\n\\n\\n \"You can take your playmates away now, Tony,\" he said. \"And don\\'t\\n bother to come around yourself. You\\'re not funny enough.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Tony found his voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Take him, Marbles!\" he growled.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a\\n long-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.\\n\\n\\n Retief heard the panel open beside him.\\n\\n\\n \"Here you go, Mister,\" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed\\n french knife lay on the sill.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks, Chip,\" Retief said. \"I won\\'t need it for these punks.\"\\n\\n\\n Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him\\n under the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol\\n from his shoulder holster.\\n\\n\\n \"Aim that at me, and I\\'ll kill you,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on, burn him!\" Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared,\\n white-faced.\\n\\n\\n \"Put that away, you!\" he yelled. \"What kind of—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" Mr. Tony said. \"Put it away, Hoany. We\\'ll fix this bum\\n later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not on this vessel, you won\\'t,\" the captain said shakily. \"I got my\\n charter to consider.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ram your charter,\" Hoany said harshly. \"You won\\'t be needing it long.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Button your floppy mouth, damn you!\" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at\\n the man on the floor. \"Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the\\n slob.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came\\n up. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.\\n\\n\\n The panel opened.\\n\\n\\n \"I usta be about your size, when I was your age,\" Chip said. \"You\\n handled them pansies right. I wouldn\\'t give \\'em the time o\\' day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, Mister. Anything else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll think of something,\" Retief said. \"This is shaping up into one of\\n those long days.\"\\n\"They don\\'t like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,\" Chip said.\\n \"But the cap\\'n knows I\\'m the best cook in the Merchant Service. They\\n won\\'t mess with me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?\" Retief asked.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re in some kind o\\' crooked business together. You want some more\\n smoked turkey?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen\\'s Worlds?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dunno. Hasn\\'t been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I\\n sure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was\\n yer age.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen\\'s\\n Worlds like?\"\\n\\n\\n \"One of \\'em\\'s cold as hell and three of \\'em\\'s colder. Most o\\' the\\n Jorgies live on Svea; that\\'s the least froze up. Man don\\'t enjoy eatin\\'\\n his own cookin\\' like he does somebody else\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s where I\\'m lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo\\'s the captain got\\n aboard for Jorgensen\\'s?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Derned if I know. In and out o\\' there like a grasshopper, ever few\\n weeks. Don\\'t never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says.\\n Don\\'t know what we even run in there for.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"To Alabaster. That\\'s nine days\\' run in-sector from Jorgensen\\'s. You\\n ain\\'t got another one of them cigars, have you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Plenty o\\' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed\\n the cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and\\n brandy.\\n\\n\\n \"Them Sweaties is what I don\\'t like,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at him questioningly.\\n\\n\\n \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin\\' devils. Skinny legs, like a\\n lobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin\\'\\n head. You can see the pulse beatin\\' when they get riled.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve never had the pleasure,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"You prob\\'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip\\n out. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"I ain\\'t superstitious ner nothin\\',\" Chip said. \"But I\\'ll be\\n triple-damned if that ain\\'t them boarding us now.\"\\n\\n\\n Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door,\\n accompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy\\n knock shook the door.\\n\\n\\n \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in, damn you,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like\\n feet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set\\n compound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.\\n Behind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\\n\\n\\n \"Yo\\' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yo\\' papiss,\" the alien said again.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ve seen it. You can take it away now.\"\\n\"Don\\'t horse around,\" the captain said. \"This fellow can get mean.\"\\n\\n\\n The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle,\\n clicked toothed pincers under Retief\\'s nose.\\n\\n\\n \"Quick, soft one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and\\n I\\'m tempted to test it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those\\n snappers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch\\n from Retief\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I\\n got no control over Skaw.\"\\nThe alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the same\\n instant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alien\\n and drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbous\\n knee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spattering\\n from the burst joint.\\n\\n\\n \"I told you he was brittle,\" Retief said. \"Next time you invite pirates\\n aboard, don\\'t bother to call.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jesus, what did you do! They\\'ll kill us!\" the captain gasped, staring\\n at the figure flopping on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,\" Retief said. \"Tell him to pass\\n the word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in\\n Terrestrial space.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Chip said. \"He\\'s quit kicking.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close\\n and sniffed.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s dead.\" The captain stared at Retief. \"We\\'re all dead men,\" he\\n said. \"These Soetti got no mercy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They won\\'t need it. Tell \\'em to sheer off; their fun is over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They got no more emotions than a blue crab—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.\\n We know their secret now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What secret? I—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be no dumber than you got to, Cap\\'n,\" Chip said. \"Sweaties die\\n easy; that\\'s the secret.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe you got a point,\" the captain said, looking at Retief. \"All they\\n got\\'s a three-man scout. It could work.\"\\n\\n\\n He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien\\n gingerly into the hall.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,\" the captain said, looking back\\n from the door. \"But I\\'ll be back to see you later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t scare us, Cap\\'n,\" Chip said. \"Him and Mr. Tony and all his\\n goons. You hit \\'em where they live, that time. They\\'re pals o\\' these\\n Sweaties. Runnin\\' some kind o\\' crooked racket.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better take the captain\\'s advice, Chip. There\\'s no point in your\\n getting involved in my problems.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'d of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That\\'s\\n where we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They don\\'t scare me none.\" Chip picked up the tray. \"I\\'ll scout around\\n a little and see what\\'s goin\\' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything\\n about that Skaw feller they\\'ll have to move fast; they won\\'t try\\n nothin\\' close to port.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won\\'t do\\n anything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.\"\\n\\n\\n Chip looked at Retief. \"You ain\\'t no tourist, Mister. I know that much.\\n You didn\\'t come out here for fun, did you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That,\" Retief said, \"would be a hard one to answer.\"\\nIV\\n\\n\\n Retief awoke at a tap on his door.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s me, Mister. Chip.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Come on in.\"\\n\\n\\n The chef entered the room, locking the door.\\n\\n\\n \"You shoulda had that door locked.\" He stood by the door, listening,\\n then turned to Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"You want to get to Jorgensen\\'s perty bad, don\\'t you, Mister?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, Chip.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. The\\n Sweaties didn\\'t say nothin\\'. Didn\\'t even act surprised, just took the\\n remains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they call\\n Marbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap\\'n in his cabin and\\n talked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap\\'n come out and give\\n some orders to the Mate.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He hated Skaw\\'s guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got a\\n gun?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A 2mm needler. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The orders cap\\'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We\\'re\\n by-passin\\' Jorgensen\\'s Worlds. We\\'ll feel the course change any minute.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out a\\n short-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain\\'s\\n cabin?\"\\n\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\\n comes down the passage?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\\n looked up from his desk, then jumped up.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you think you\\'re doing, busting in here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hear you\\'re planning a course change, Captain.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got damn big ears.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think we\\'d better call in at Jorgensen\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I\\'m in command of this vessel,\"\\n he said. \"I\\'m changing course for Alabaster.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\\n just hold your course for Jorgensen\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not bloody likely.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your use of the word \\'bloody\\' is interesting, Captain. Don\\'t try to\\n change course.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\\n\\n\\n \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\\n the desk, gripped the captain\\'s wrist.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\\n\\n\\n \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief\\'s, he\\n eased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\\n drawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\\n\\n\\n \"You busted it, you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a cheapjack who\\'s sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\\n hoods.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t put it over, hick.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tell him.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\\n he said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\\n the mike and looked up at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\\n to sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief released the captain\\'s wrist and turned to the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Chip, I\\'m locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what\\'s\\n going on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I\\'m sitting up with\\n a sick friend.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he\\'s slippery.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\\n\\n\\n Retief settled himself in a chair.\\n\\n\\n \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I\\'m going to\\n stay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen\\'s Worlds.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\\n\\n\\n \"Then I\\'ll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\\n like dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don\\'t mind me.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\\n\\n\\n \"If anything happens that I don\\'t like,\" he said, \"I\\'ll wake you up.\\n With this.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He looked out across the\\n heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly\\n around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and\\n started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully\\n because of the lesser gravitation.\\n\\n\\n Thig was shorter than the average Earthman—although on Ortha he\\n was well above the average in height—but his body was thick and\\n powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features\\n were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were\\n a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore\\n no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his\\n rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\\n\\n\\n The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the\\n little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to\\n wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to\\n bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space\\n cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature\\'s\\n mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a\\n planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\\n\\n\\n Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them\\n all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,\\n however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every\\n respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope\\n made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\\n\\n\\n The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a\\n leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered\\n with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal\\n and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\\n\\n\\n Thig\\'s cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing\\'s\\n stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished\\n metal at the reflection of himself!\\n\\n\\n The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious\\n time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the\\n intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped\\n across the mouth and neck of the stranger....\\nLewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had\\n ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid\\n desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was\\n going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that\\n shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly\\n he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn\\'t\\n dared touch the machine since.\\n\\n\\n For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never\\n been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised\\n his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on\\n a trailer tour of the\\nWest\\nthat very summer. Since that promise, he\\n could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and\\n be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out\\n of his subconscious. Yet he\\nhad\\nto write at least three novelets and\\n a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great\\n adventure—or the trip was off.\\n\\n\\n So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed\\n for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a\\n salable yarn....\\n\\n\\n \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the\\n road. \"What\\'s the trouble?\"\\n\\n\\n Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the\\n stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech\\n and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand\\n clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of\\n his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.\\n\"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured\\n Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that\\n must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he\\n wears he might be Thig.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we\\n will transfer the Earthman\\'s memories and meager store of knowledge to\\n the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without\\n arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the\\n two inner planets.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear\\n these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use\\n of our limbs so.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling\\n out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that\\n you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted\\n Terry\\'s body and headed for the laboratory.\\n\\n\\n Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully\\n cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they\\n knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely\\n lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained\\n antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde\\n were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling\\n robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,\\n their love-life, their everything!\\n\\n\\n So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped\\n on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to\\n one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their\\n heads.\\n\\n\\n For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry\\'s brain\\n dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman\\n proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped\\n completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his\\n body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured\\n brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\\n\\n\\n \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\\n \"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new\\n body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is\\n aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming\\n baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.\"\\n\\n\\n An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and\\n painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship\\n and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running\\n inland to his home.\\n\\n\\n Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry\\'s own childhood\\n memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place\\n where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that\\n old \\'Notch-ear\\' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of\\n that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his\\n pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\\n\\n\\n He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on\\n the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little\\n Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his\\n acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from\\n around his heart.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the\\n dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men\\n had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other\\n primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding\\n the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\\n\\n\\n Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,\\n trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked\\n achingly up into his throat.\\n\\n\\n \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called\\n up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that\\n Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"\\n and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\"\\n\"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\\n\\n\\n For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had\\n he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously\\n adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this\\n way, he realized—more natural.\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the\\n glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used\\n to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing\\n but a handful of these.\"\\n\\n\\n He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen\\'s startled eyes and she clung,\\n unbelieving, to his arm.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they\\'re worth a fortune! We can buy that new\\n trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right\\n away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages\\n and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he\\n hoped that the west had reformed.\\n\\n\\n \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I\\'m\\n warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from\\n the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.\\n\"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks\\n later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt\\n beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\\n\\n\\n \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went\\n on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as\\n beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\\n\\n\\n Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the\\n exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car\\n and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living\\n quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the\\n chaos of his cool Orthan brain.\\n\\n\\n Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows\\n and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,\\n including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force\\n to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,\\n of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be\\n landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,\\n imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the\\n Hordes?\\n\\n\\n Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the\\n dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three\\n months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed\\n for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady\\n glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had\\n experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against\\n the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt\\n division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer\\n thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty\\n added zest to every day\\'s life.\\n\\n\\n The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to\\n the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,\\n would one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to\\n the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan\\n civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain\\n well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast\\n mechanical hives.\\n\\n\\n There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had\\n caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath\\n them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid\\n red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and\\n cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,\\n who nestled trustingly against his tense man\\'s body and slept—the son\\n of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\\n\\n\\n Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better\\n of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to\\n blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the\\n road toward the beach.\\n\\n\\n The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly\\n but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the\\n door and called after him.\\n\\n\\n \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I\\'ll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\\n\\n\\n He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she\\n would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of\\n person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a\\n hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\\n\\n\\n Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the\\n autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that\\n lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers\\' Riot\" and blocked\\n in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the\\n careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be\\n sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never\\n be written, but he toyed with the idea.\\n\\n\\n So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from\\n the unquestioning worship of the Horde!\\n\"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report\\n on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now\\n have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to\\n Ortha at once.\\n\\n\\n \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the\\n complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations\\n of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they\\n were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that\\n three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient\\n for the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and\\n exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for\\n example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once\\n a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own\\n degree of knowledge and comfort?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a\\n race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way\\n of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The\\n Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.\\n \"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.\\n There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long\\n forgotten.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His\\n words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this\\n world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\\n\\n\\n Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the\\n squat scientist\\'s desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments\\n and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the\\n walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of\\n a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of\\n the invisible radiations from that weapon\\'s hot throat and flesh or\\n vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\\n\\n\\n The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble\\n clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig\\'s\\n broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly\\n he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children\\n of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must\\n stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an\\n empty world—this planet was not for them.\\n\\n\\n \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a\\n woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need\\n this planet.\"\\n\\n\\n Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its\\n case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac\\n of the finest members of the Horde.\\n\\n\\n \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.\\n \"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we\\n must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\\n\\n\\n Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick\\n jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying\\n the Orthan\\'s vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into\\n Kam\\'s startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it\\n could be uttered.\\n\\n\\n Kam\\'s hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness\\n and dragged his blaster from it. Thig\\'s other hand clamped over his and\\n for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly\\n struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam\\'s other hand\\n fought against that lone arm of Thig.\\nThe scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his\\n weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig\\'s waist. Thig\\n suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden\\n reversal of pressure on Kam\\'s gun hand sent the weapon swivelling\\n about full upon its owner\\'s thick torso. Thig\\'s fingers pressed down\\n upon Kam\\'s button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the\\n decomposition blaster, and Kam\\'s muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\\n\\n\\n Before Thig\\'s eyes half of his comrade\\'s body sloughed away into foul\\n corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated\\n matter. Horror for what he had done—that he had slain one of his own\\n Horde—made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled\\n for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the\\n control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the\\n narrowed icy eyes of his commander.\\n\\n\\n He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his\\n skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.\\n His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited\\n stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all\\n the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy\\n yarn—they would all be dead anyhow soon.\\n\\n\\n Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly\\n toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp\\n would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon\\n upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....\\nBam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a\\n hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He\\n was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of\\n bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon\\n his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed\\n him with those savage blows upon the head.\\n\\n\\n Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his\\n ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now\\n owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently\\n used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his\\n unconscious body.\\n\\n\\n Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control\\n room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies\\n through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered\\n why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures\\n of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible\\n for his sudden madness.\\n\\n\\n The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association\\n of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack\\n beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the\\n weapon. He tugged it free.\\n\\n\\n In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck\\n toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,\\n the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp\\n scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man\\'s throat squalled\\n out into a senseless whinny.\\n\\n\\n Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length\\n of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared\\n full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there\\n watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten\\n lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and\\n chest. He was a madman!\\n\\n\\n The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam\\'s death, and\\n now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all\\n served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.\\n The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of\\n the Orthan.\\n\\n\\n So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad\\n stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over\\n the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that\\n victory had given him to drive him along.\\n\\n\\n He had saved a world\\'s civilization from extinction! The thought\\n sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After\\n all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking\\n of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\\n\\n\\n He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship\\'s log and\\n read the last few nervously scrawled lines:\\nPlanet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that\\n strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent\\n there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and\\n destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.\\n Already I feel the insidious virus of....\\nAnd there his writing ended abruptly.\\n\\n\\n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the\\n planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship\\'s\\n path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger\\n on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\\n\\n\\n Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of\\n a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship\\'s\\n hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\\n\\n\\n He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving\\n him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new\\n body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the\\n emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months\\n before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen\\'s lips tight against his.\\nThig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the\\n rockets driving him from the parent ship.\\nHe swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the\\n great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no\\n regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first\\n existence.\\n\\n\\n He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the\\n monotonous routine of existence that had once been his—and his heart\\n thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days\\n he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\\n\\n\\n He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a\\n tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The\\n rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching\\n the ship echoed through the hull-plates.\\n\\n\\n He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the\\n roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion\\n that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his\\n rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that\\n crowded his mind.\\n\\n\\n He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time\\n he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys\\n below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,\\n despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer\\n space.\\n\\n\\n He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight\\n differences in his appearance from an Earthman\\'s, and his fingers\\n trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said\\n a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very\\n deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories\\n were hot, bitter pains.\\nEarth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\\n heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde\\'s\\n creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\\n West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\\n now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man\\'s family.\\n\\n\\n The knowledge that Ellen\\'s love was not really meant for him would be\\n a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\\n dreams and happiness must never be shattered.\\n\\n\\n The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\\n of Long Island in the growing twilight.\\n\\n\\n A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\\n cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\\n He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\\n them....\\n\\n\\n He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Just before the silence grew\\n awkward, Magnan went on.\\n\\n\\n \"There are four planets in the group,\" he said. \"Two double planets,\\n all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They\\'re\\n called Jorgensen\\'s Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance\\n whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti\\n have been penetrating.\\n\\n\\n \"Now—\" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—\"we have learned\\n that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they\\'ve met no\\n opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they\\n intend to seize Jorgensen\\'s Worlds by force.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief\\'s reaction. Retief drew\\n carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.\\n\\n\\n \"This is open aggression, Retief,\" he said, \"in case I haven\\'t made\\n myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien\\n species. Obviously, we can\\'t allow it.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.\\n\\n\\n \"A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,\\n Jorgensen\\'s Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They\\'re\\n farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in\\n their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war\\n potential, by conventional standards, is nil.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan tapped the folder before him.\\n\\n\\n \"I have here,\" he said solemnly, \"information which will change that\\n picture completely.\" He leaned back and blinked at Retief.\\n\"All right, Mr. Councillor,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ll play along; what\\'s in\\n the folder?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down.\\n\\n\\n \"First,\" he said. \"The Soetti War Plan—in detail. We were fortunate\\n enough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegade\\n Terrestrials who\\'ve been advising the Soetti.\" He folded another\\n finger. \"Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen\\'s people, worked out by\\n the Theory group.\" He wrestled a third finger down. \"Lastly; an Utter\\n Top Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-acceleration\\n field into a potent weapon—a development our systems people have been\\n holding in reserve for just such a situation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that all?\" Retief said. \"You\\'ve still got two fingers sticking up.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away.\\n\\n\\n \"This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, this\\n information could be catastrophic. You\\'ll memorize it before you leave\\n this building.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll carry it, sealed,\" Retief said. \"That way nobody can sweat it out\\n of me.\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan started to shake his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said. \"If it\\'s trapped for destruction, I suppose—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve heard of these Jorgensen\\'s Worlds,\" Retief said. \"I remember an\\n agent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard with\\n cards and dice. Never played for money, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Umm,\" Magnan said. \"Don\\'t make the error of personalizing this\\n situation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of these\\n backwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow its\\n natural course, as always.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When does this attack happen?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Less than four weeks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That doesn\\'t leave me much time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far as\\n Aldo Cerise. You\\'ll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the rest\\n of the way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don\\'t make it?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked sour. \"Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to put\\n all our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you is\\n not misplaced.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This antiac conversion; how long does it take?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. The\\n Jorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic of\\n some sort.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the tickets\\n inside.\\n\\n\\n \"Less than four hours to departure time,\" he said. \"I\\'d better not\\n start any long books.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination,\" Magnan\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Retief stood up. \"If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The allusion escapes me,\" Magnan said coldly. \"And one last word. The\\n Soetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen\\'s Worlds; don\\'t\\n get yourself interned.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll tell you what,\" Retief said soberly. \"In a pinch, I\\'ll mention\\n your name.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll be traveling with Class X credentials,\" Magnan snapped. \"There\\n must be nothing to connect you with the Corps.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll never guess,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ll pose as a gentleman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better be getting started,\" Magnan said, shuffling papers.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right,\" Retief said. \"If I work at it, I might manage a\\n snootful by takeoff.\" He went to the door. \"No objection to my checking\\n out a needler, is there?\"\\n\\n\\n Magnan looked up. \"I suppose not. What do you want with it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a feeling I\\'ve got.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some day,\" Retief said, \"I may take you up on that.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on the\\n counter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legend\\n \"ALDO CERISE—INTERPLANETARY.\" A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouse\\n and a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watching\\n Retief from the corner of his eye.\\n\\n\\n Retief glanced at him.\\n\\n\\n The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth and\\n spat it on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Was there something?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group,\" Retief said.\\n \"Is it on schedule?\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. \"Filled\\n up. Try again in a couple of weeks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What time does it leave?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s stick to facts,\" Retief said. \"Don\\'t try to think. What time is\\n it due out?\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk smiled pityingly. \"It\\'s my lunch hour,\" he said. \"I\\'ll be\\n open in an hour.\" He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.\\n\\n\\n \"If I have to come around this counter,\" Retief said, \"I\\'ll feed that\\n thumb to you the hard way.\"\\n\\n\\n The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief\\'s eye,\\n closed his mouth and swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"Like it says there,\" he said, jerking a thumb at the board. \"Lifts in\\n an hour. But you won\\'t be on it,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at him.\\n\\n\\n \"Some ... ah ... VIP\\'s required accommodation,\" he said. He hooked\\n a finger inside the sequined collar. \"All tourist reservations were\\n canceled. You\\'ll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship\\n next—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Which gate?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"For ... ah...?\"\\n\\n\\n \"For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen\\'s Worlds,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the clerk said. \"Gate 19,\" he added quickly. \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign\\n reading\\nTo Gates 16-30\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"Another smart alec,\" the clerk said behind him.\\nRetief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\\n covered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\\n with a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\\n gray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\\n\\n\\n \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\n Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\\n\\n\\n The guard blinked at it.\\n\\n\\n \"Whassat?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\\n says he\\'s out to lunch.\"\\n\\n\\n The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\\n against the handrail.\\n\\n\\n \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\\n right into the guard\\'s midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\\n went to his knees.\\n\\n\\n \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn\\'t resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\\n past while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\\n over the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\\n\\n\\n A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\\n\\n\\n \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\\n along the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\\n The door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\\n floor. It was expensive looking baggage.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\\n florid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\\n the open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\\n clamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Somebody in the cabin. Get \\'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\\n he backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\\n\\n\\n \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony\\'s room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\\n out of here, fellow! You\\'re keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it\\'s Mr.\\n Tony\\'s room.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know Mr. Tony. He\\'ll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\\n sat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\\n the corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\\n oversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\\n glanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\\n out?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\\n handle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\\n the trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\\n far wall of the corridor and burst.\\n\\n\\n Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\\n face of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\\n\\n\\n \"Mister, you must be—\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'ll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\\n the door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\\nFive minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a\\n blue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye\\n stared at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"Is this the joker?\" he grated.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,\\n \"That\\'s him, sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m captain of this vessel,\" the first man said. \"You\\'ve got two\\n minutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When you can spare the time from your other duties,\" Retief said,\\n \"take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code.\\n That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in\\n interplanetary commerce.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A space lawyer.\" The captain turned. \"Throw him out, boys.\"\\n\\n\\n Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on, pitch him out,\" the captain snapped.\\n\\n\\n Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t try it,\" he said softly.\\n\\n\\n One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and\\n stepped forward, then hesitated.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he said. \"This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s him,\" the thick-necked man called. \"Spilled Mr. Tony\\'s\\n possessions right on the deck.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Deal me out,\" the bouncer said. \"He can stay put as long as he wants\\n to. I signed on to move cargo. Let\\'s go, Moe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,\" Retief said.\\n \"We\\'re due to lift in twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The\\n Captain\\'s voice prevailed.\\n\\n\\n \"—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Close the door as you leave,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man paused at the door. \"We\\'ll see you when you come\\n out.\"\\nIII\\n\\n\\n Four waiters passed Retief\\'s table without stopping. A fifth leaned\\n against the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.\\n\\n\\n At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform\\n and with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male\\n passengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional\\n glances Retief\\'s way.\\n\\n\\n A panel opened in the wall behind Retief\\'s chair. Bright blue eyes\\n peered out from under a white chef\\'s cap.\\n\\n\\n \"Givin\\' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Looks like it, old-timer,\" Retief said. \"Maybe I\\'d better go join the\\n skipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see your point.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You set right where you\\'re at, Mister. I\\'ll rustle you up a plate.\"\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed\\n up with mushrooms and garlic butter.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Chip,\" the chef said. \"I don\\'t like the Cap\\'n. You can tell him I\\n said so. Don\\'t like his friends, either. Don\\'t like them dern Sweaties,\\n look at a man like he was a worm.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you\\'ve got the\\n right idea on the Soetti, too,\" Retief said. He poured red wine into a\\n glass. \"Here\\'s to you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dern right,\" Chip said. \"Dunno who ever thought up broiling \\'em.\\n Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert.\\n You like brandy in yer coffee?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Chip, you\\'re a genius.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like to see a feller eat,\" Chip said. \"I gotta go now. If you need\\n anything, holler.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to\\n Jorgensen\\'s Worlds. Then, if Magnan\\'s information was correct,\\n there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a\\n temptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It\\n would be good to know what Jorgensen\\'s Worlds would be up against.\\n\\n\\n Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and\\n coffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony\\n and his retainers still sat at the Captain\\'s table.\\n\\n\\n As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across\\n the room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took\\n a cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted\\n end in Retief\\'s coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.\\n\\n\\n The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.\\n\\n\\n \"You must want to get to Jorgensen\\'s pretty bad,\" the thug said in a\\n grating voice. \"What\\'s your game, hick?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I want my coffee,\" he said. He looked at the thug. \"You\\n drink it.\"\\n\\n\\n The thug squinted at Retief. \"A wise hick,\" he began.\\n\\n\\n With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug\\'s\\n face, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug\\n went down.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.\\n\\n\\n \"You can take your playmates away now, Tony,\" he said. \"And don\\'t\\n bother to come around yourself. You\\'re not funny enough.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Tony found his voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Take him, Marbles!\" he growled.\\n\\n\\n The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a\\n long-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.\\n\\n\\n Retief heard the panel open beside him.\\n\\n\\n \"Here you go, Mister,\" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed\\n french knife lay on the sill.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks, Chip,\" Retief said. \"I won\\'t need it for these punks.\"\\n\\n\\n Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him\\n under the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol\\n from his shoulder holster.\\n\\n\\n \"Aim that at me, and I\\'ll kill you,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on, burn him!\" Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared,\\n white-faced.\\n\\n\\n \"Put that away, you!\" he yelled. \"What kind of—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" Mr. Tony said. \"Put it away, Hoany. We\\'ll fix this bum\\n later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not on this vessel, you won\\'t,\" the captain said shakily. \"I got my\\n charter to consider.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ram your charter,\" Hoany said harshly. \"You won\\'t be needing it long.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Button your floppy mouth, damn you!\" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at\\n the man on the floor. \"Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the\\n slob.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came\\n up. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.\\n\\n\\n The panel opened.\\n\\n\\n \"I usta be about your size, when I was your age,\" Chip said. \"You\\n handled them pansies right. I wouldn\\'t give \\'em the time o\\' day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, Mister. Anything else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll think of something,\" Retief said. \"This is shaping up into one of\\n those long days.\"\\n\"They don\\'t like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,\" Chip said.\\n \"But the cap\\'n knows I\\'m the best cook in the Merchant Service. They\\n won\\'t mess with me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?\" Retief asked.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re in some kind o\\' crooked business together. You want some more\\n smoked turkey?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen\\'s Worlds?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dunno. Hasn\\'t been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I\\n sure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was\\n yer age.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen\\'s\\n Worlds like?\"\\n\\n\\n \"One of \\'em\\'s cold as hell and three of \\'em\\'s colder. Most o\\' the\\n Jorgies live on Svea; that\\'s the least froze up. Man don\\'t enjoy eatin\\'\\n his own cookin\\' like he does somebody else\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s where I\\'m lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo\\'s the captain got\\n aboard for Jorgensen\\'s?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Derned if I know. In and out o\\' there like a grasshopper, ever few\\n weeks. Don\\'t never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says.\\n Don\\'t know what we even run in there for.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"To Alabaster. That\\'s nine days\\' run in-sector from Jorgensen\\'s. You\\n ain\\'t got another one of them cigars, have you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Plenty o\\' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed\\n the cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and\\n brandy.\\n\\n\\n \"Them Sweaties is what I don\\'t like,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Retief looked at him questioningly.\\n\\n\\n \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin\\' devils. Skinny legs, like a\\n lobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin\\'\\n head. You can see the pulse beatin\\' when they get riled.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve never had the pleasure,\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"You prob\\'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip\\n out. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"I ain\\'t superstitious ner nothin\\',\" Chip said. \"But I\\'ll be\\n triple-damned if that ain\\'t them boarding us now.\"\\n\\n\\n Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door,\\n accompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy\\n knock shook the door.\\n\\n\\n \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in, damn you,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like\\n feet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set\\n compound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.\\n Behind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\\n\\n\\n \"Yo\\' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yo\\' papiss,\" the alien said again.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I\\'ve seen it. You can take it away now.\"\\n\"Don\\'t horse around,\" the captain said. \"This fellow can get mean.\"\\n\\n\\n The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle,\\n clicked toothed pincers under Retief\\'s nose.\\n\\n\\n \"Quick, soft one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and\\n I\\'m tempted to test it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those\\n snappers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch\\n from Retief\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I\\n got no control over Skaw.\"\\nThe alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the same\\n instant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alien\\n and drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbous\\n knee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spattering\\n from the burst joint.\\n\\n\\n \"I told you he was brittle,\" Retief said. \"Next time you invite pirates\\n aboard, don\\'t bother to call.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jesus, what did you do! They\\'ll kill us!\" the captain gasped, staring\\n at the figure flopping on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,\" Retief said. \"Tell him to pass\\n the word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in\\n Terrestrial space.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Chip said. \"He\\'s quit kicking.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close\\n and sniffed.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s dead.\" The captain stared at Retief. \"We\\'re all dead men,\" he\\n said. \"These Soetti got no mercy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They won\\'t need it. Tell \\'em to sheer off; their fun is over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They got no more emotions than a blue crab—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.\\n We know their secret now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What secret? I—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be no dumber than you got to, Cap\\'n,\" Chip said. \"Sweaties die\\n easy; that\\'s the secret.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe you got a point,\" the captain said, looking at Retief. \"All they\\n got\\'s a three-man scout. It could work.\"\\n\\n\\n He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien\\n gingerly into the hall.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,\" the captain said, looking back\\n from the door. \"But I\\'ll be back to see you later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t scare us, Cap\\'n,\" Chip said. \"Him and Mr. Tony and all his\\n goons. You hit \\'em where they live, that time. They\\'re pals o\\' these\\n Sweaties. Runnin\\' some kind o\\' crooked racket.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better take the captain\\'s advice, Chip. There\\'s no point in your\\n getting involved in my problems.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'d of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That\\'s\\n where we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They don\\'t scare me none.\" Chip picked up the tray. \"I\\'ll scout around\\n a little and see what\\'s goin\\' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything\\n about that Skaw feller they\\'ll have to move fast; they won\\'t try\\n nothin\\' close to port.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won\\'t do\\n anything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.\"\\n\\n\\n Chip looked at Retief. \"You ain\\'t no tourist, Mister. I know that much.\\n You didn\\'t come out here for fun, did you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That,\" Retief said, \"would be a hard one to answer.\"\\nIV\\n\\n\\n Retief awoke at a tap on his door.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s me, Mister. Chip.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Come on in.\"\\n\\n\\n The chef entered the room, locking the door.\\n\\n\\n \"You shoulda had that door locked.\" He stood by the door, listening,\\n then turned to Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"You want to get to Jorgensen\\'s perty bad, don\\'t you, Mister?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, Chip.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. The\\n Sweaties didn\\'t say nothin\\'. Didn\\'t even act surprised, just took the\\n remains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they call\\n Marbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap\\'n in his cabin and\\n talked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap\\'n come out and give\\n some orders to the Mate.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He hated Skaw\\'s guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got a\\n gun?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A 2mm needler. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The orders cap\\'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We\\'re\\n by-passin\\' Jorgensen\\'s Worlds. We\\'ll feel the course change any minute.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out a\\n short-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain\\'s\\n cabin?\"\\n\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\\n comes down the passage?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\\n looked up from his desk, then jumped up.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you think you\\'re doing, busting in here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hear you\\'re planning a course change, Captain.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got damn big ears.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think we\\'d better call in at Jorgensen\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I\\'m in command of this vessel,\"\\n he said. \"I\\'m changing course for Alabaster.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\\n just hold your course for Jorgensen\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not bloody likely.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your use of the word \\'bloody\\' is interesting, Captain. Don\\'t try to\\n change course.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\\n\\n\\n \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\\n the desk, gripped the captain\\'s wrist.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\\n\\n\\n \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief\\'s, he\\n eased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\\n drawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\\n\\n\\n \"You busted it, you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a cheapjack who\\'s sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\\n hoods.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t put it over, hick.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tell him.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\\n he said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\\n the mike and looked up at Retief.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\\n to sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\\n\\n\\n Retief released the captain\\'s wrist and turned to the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Chip, I\\'m locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what\\'s\\n going on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I\\'m sitting up with\\n a sick friend.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he\\'s slippery.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\\n\\n\\n Retief settled himself in a chair.\\n\\n\\n \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I\\'m going to\\n stay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen\\'s Worlds.\"\\n\\n\\n The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\\n\\n\\n \"Then I\\'ll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\\n like dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don\\'t mind me.\"\\n\\n\\n Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\\n\\n\\n \"If anything happens that I don\\'t like,\" he said, \"I\\'ll wake you up.\\n With this.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But he was\\n\\n forgetting one tiny thing—like calls to like.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Spring 1944.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nPeter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but\\n the dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face,\\n trickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop,\\n from his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at\\n a queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow\\n where his eyes had been.\\nThere was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the\\n blood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great\\n banks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would\\n never come to life again.\\nI rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as\\n before: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not\\n changed, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold\\n and alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like\\n the machinery, and like Peter.\\nIt was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what\\n Peter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,\\n either. It was just an emptiness—a void that could not be filled by\\n eating or drinking.\\nIt was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise\\n than they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for\\n reason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\\nBut the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore.\\n For the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could\\n not solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within\\n me, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly—something moved on the skin of my\\n cheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\\nA tear was trickling down my cheek.\\nYoung Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\\n satisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\\nCitadel\\nwas complete, every\\n minutest detail provided for—on paper. In two weeks they would be\\n laying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\\n glittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\\n finished, a living thing.\\n\\n\\n Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\\n ship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\\n In his mind\\'s eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\\n satellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\\n insatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\\n laboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\\n meteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\\n stern—all the children of his brain.\\n\\n\\n Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\\n atmosphere, away from Earth\\'s inexorable gravitational pull, would be\\n a laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\\n the sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\\n ether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\\n\\n\\n A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\\n of the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\\n that thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\\n as if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\\n back.\\n\\n\\n There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\\n impassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\\n face, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\\n blood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\\n body.\\n\\n\\n For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\\n eyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\\n slowly away and was gone.\\n\\n\\n \"Lord!\" he said.\\n\\n\\n He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\\n somewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\\n moment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\\n was normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\\n world had grown suddenly unreal.\\n\\n\\n One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\\n from the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\\n other part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\\n It considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\\n decided that this was probable.\\n\\n\\n Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\\n were shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\\n newsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\\n\\n\\n There were flaring red headlines.\\n\\n\\n Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\\n of course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\\n glad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\\n terrible illusion.\\nINVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\\n\\n 200 DEAD\\n\\n\\n Then lines of type, and farther down:\\n50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\\n\\n PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\\n\\n\\n He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\\nMOON SHIP DESTROYED\\n\\n IN TRANSIT\\n\\n NO COMMUNICATION FROM\\n\\n ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\\n\\n STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\\n\\n PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\\n\\n WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\\n\\n\\n The item below the last one said:\\n\\n\\n Pacifica, June 7—The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\\n in fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\\n R. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\\n\\n\\n \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\\n peoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\\n depredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\\n London; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\\n and in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\\n reports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\\n have not seen them.\\n\\n\\n \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\\n we face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\\nsuperior to ourselves in every way\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\\n ago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\\n in any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\\n have treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\\n have treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\\n attacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\\n nor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\\n have done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\\n driven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\\n more intolerable than any normal invasion.\\n\\n\\n \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\\n challenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\\n are threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\\n the Invaders!\"\\n\\n\\n Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\\n first time.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWill\\nwe?\" he asked himself softly.\\nIt was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper\\'s\\n laboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\\n a halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\\n mechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\\n He mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\\n in the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\\n far enough to admit him.\\n\\n\\n Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\\n on her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\\n blonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\\n\\n\\n \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\\n Then she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\\n \"Darling, what\\'s wrong?\"\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\\n\\n\\n She frowned. \"Why, no—Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\\n hours straight. Haven\\'t seen anybody, haven\\'t heard anything. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You wouldn\\'t believe me. Where\\'s your newsbox?\"\\n\\n\\n She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\\n you know I haven\\'t one—it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\\n there\\'s trouble or not. What—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\\n\\n\\n She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\\n walked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\\n papers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\\n and pressed the stud.\\n\\n\\n A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\\n suddenly leapt into full brilliance.\\n\\n\\n Lorelei caught her breath.\\n\\n\\n It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\\n the warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\\n transport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\\n been dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\\n yes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\\n disappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\\n heartbeat they were gone.\\n\\n\\n There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\\n defiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\\n flesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\\n men and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\\n joined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\\n helpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\\n horrible than any cry of agony.\\n\\n\\n \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\\n strangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\\n streets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\\nLorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\\n \"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides,\\n and they know it; but they have to do it. This isn\\'t like a war, where\\n the noncombatants\\' morale has to be kept up. There aren\\'t going to be\\n any noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about\\n them, so that he can fight them—and then it may not be enough.\"\\n\\n\\n The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared\\n away from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached\\n out to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles\\n tense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating\\n up the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the\\n rest.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ...\\n forty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted.\\n Then they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone\\n through the solid wall, or simply melted away.\\n\\n\\n The man and woman clung together, waiting.\\n\\n\\n There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and\\n other faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man\\n screamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty\\n gurgle and died, leaving silence again.\\n\\n\\n Peter\\'s lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms\\n were jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away\\n from him and started toward the inner room.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\\n\\n\\n She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don\\'t go in there!\\nPeter!\\n\" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\\n\\n\\n There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been\\n cleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down\\n the narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal\\n cages, and paused just short of it.\\n\\n\\n The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the\\n distorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his\\n range of vision.\\nPeter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\\n Lorelei\\'s assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\\n broad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\\n glazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\\n straight ahead of him.\\n\\n\\n The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\\n In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\\n paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\\n\\n\\n The little man\\'s body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\\n relaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\\n legs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\\n grew gradually flatter.\\n\\n\\n When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\\n puddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\\n\\n\\n There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\\n fear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\\n in a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\\n\\n\\n The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\\n but there was a tiny sound in Peter\\'s brain, a thin, dry whispering.\\n\\n\\n The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\\n\"\\n\\n\\n The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\\n ears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\\n seemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\\n were lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\\n the eyes were alive.\\n\\n\\n \"\\n... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\n... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\\n time he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\\n swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\\n slowly....\\n\\n\\n \"\\nOpreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n His voice was hoarse. \"Don\\'t look! Don\\'t—Go back!\" The horrible,\\n mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\\n His insides writhed to thrust it out.\\n\\n\\n She didn\\'t see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\\n floor.\\n\\n\\n The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\\n it back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\\n fingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\\n the room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\\nSomebody said, \"Doctor!\"\\n\\n\\n He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei—\" but his mouth only\\n twitched feebly. He couldn\\'t seem to get it to work properly.\\n\\n\\n He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\\n\\n\\n He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;\\n in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\\n oddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\\n starched odor.\\n\\n\\n \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\\n pressed him back into the sheets.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\\n\\n\\n He tried to get up again. \"Where\\'s Lorelei?\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s well, and you\\'ll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You\\'ve been a\\n very sick man.\"\\n\\n\\n Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\\n around him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\\n\\n\\n The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\\n turned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\\n\\n\\n Peter\\'s head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\\n stand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\\n milky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\\n\\n\\n In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\\n before he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can\\'t—fool me. It\\'s been\\nmore\\n—than three—months.\"\\n\\n\\n He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\\n kept asking them why he couldn\\'t see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\\n out of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he\\'d\\n been in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\\n sooner.\\n\\n\\n \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\\n \"Seeing that assistant of hers—it was enough to knock anybody out,\\n especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\\nthem\\nfor approximately five minutes. Yes, we know—you talked a lot. It\\'s a\\n miracle you\\'re alive, and rational.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven\\'t explained why\\n I haven\\'t been able to see her.\"\\n\\n\\n Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you\\'re strong enough to\\n take it. She\\'s underground, with the rest of the women and children,\\n and a good two-thirds of the male population. That\\'s where you\\'ll go,\\n as soon as you\\'re well enough to be moved. We started digging in six\\n months ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\\n\\n\\n Arnold\\'s strong jaw knotted. \"We\\'re hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else\\n has failed.\"\\n\\n\\n Peter couldn\\'t think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold\\'s voice went on\\n after a moment, musingly. \"We\\'re burrowing into the earth, like worms.\\n It didn\\'t take us long to find out we couldn\\'t kill them. They didn\\'t\\n even take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\\n when a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\\n one time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\\n didn\\'t hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they\\'d\\n been annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it\\'s still\\n smoldering.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\\n\\n\\n \"Since then, we\\'ve been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be\\n an impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated\\n areas, of course, but it doesn\\'t matter. By the time we excavate\\n enough to take care of a quarter of the earth\\'s population, the other\\n three-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\\n\\n\\n Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You\\'ve got to be. You\\'re part of our\\n last hope, you see.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Our last hope?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. You\\'re a scientist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the\\nCitadel\\n. No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,\\nmaybe\\n, he\\n thought,\\nthere\\'s a chance\\n....\\nIt wasn\\'t very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It lay\\n there in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than\\n five hundred meters in diameter, where the\\nCitadel\\nwas to have been a\\n thousand. It wouldn\\'t house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into\\n the hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren\\'t filled with\\n the latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,\\n there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to\\n last a lifetime.\\n\\n\\n It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was\\n one other change, one that you couldn\\'t see from the outside. The solid\\n meters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic\\n rays, were gone.\\n\\n\\n A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to\\n the left of the airlock—\\nThe Avenger\\n. He stepped away now, and joined\\n the group a little distance away, silently waiting.\\n\\n\\n Lorelei said, \"You can\\'t do it. I won\\'t let you! Peter—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Darling,\" he began wearily.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t throw your life away! Give us time—there must be another way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if\\n he could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.\\n \"Darling, listen to me. We\\'ve tried everything. We\\'ve gone underground,\\n but that\\'s only delaying the end.\\nThey\\nstill come down here, only not\\n as many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth\\n rate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You\\'ve seen the figures:\\n we\\'re riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll live, and we\\'ll die, because they\\'re a superior race. We\\'re a\\n million years too far back even to understand what they are or where\\n they came from. Besides them, we\\'re apes. There\\'s only one answer.\"\\n\\n\\n She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her\\n slender body. But he went remorselessly on.\\n\\n\\n \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They\\n make tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,\\n or a dozen ears—or a better brain. Out of those millions of\\n possible mutations, there\\'s one that will save the human race. We\\n can\\'t fight\\nthem\\n, but a superman could. That\\'s our only chance.\\n Lorelei—darling—don\\'t you see that?\"\\n\\n\\n She choked, \"But why can\\'t you take me along?\"\\n\\n\\n He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he\\n said bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don\\'t only work on embryos;\\n they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of\\n staying alive. You\\'d have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.\\n I couldn\\'t stand that. I\\'d kill myself, and then humanity would die,\\n too. You\\'d be their murderer.\"\\n\\n\\n Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no\\n longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone\\n out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You\\'ll\\n come back, Peter.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. A\\n line from an old film kept echoing through his head. \"\\nThey\\'ll\\ncome\\n back—but not as\\nboys\\n!\"\\n\\n\\n We\\'ll come back, but not as men.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ll come back, but not as elephants.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ll come back, but not as octopi.\\nHe was trembling violently. He ran the last few steps, stumbled into\\n the airlock, and pressed the stud that would seal the door behind him.\\nWe\\'ll come back....\\nHe heard the massive disk sink home, closing him\\n off. Then he sank down on the floor of the airlock and put his head in\\n shaking hands.\\n\\n\\n After a while he roused himself, closed the inner door of the lock\\n behind him, and walked down the long corridor into the control chamber.\\n The shining banks of keys were there, waiting for his touch; he slumped\\n down before them and listlessly closed the contact of the visiplate.\\n\\n\\n He swung its field slowly, scanning for the last time the bare walls\\n of the underground chamber, making sure that all the spectators had\\n retired out of the way of the blast. Then his clawed fingers poised\\n over the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down.\\n\\n\\n Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the\\n heavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one.\\n The energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed\\n smoothly behind him. The last doors, cleverly camouflaged, slipped back\\n into place and then dwindled in the distance. It was done.\\n\\n\\n He flashed on out, past the moon, past Mars, over the asteroid belt.\\n The days merged into weeks, then months, and finally, far out,\\nThe\\n Avenger\\ncurved into an orbit and held it. The great motors died, and\\n the silence pressed in about him.\\n\\n\\n Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through\\n his flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working\\n its slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes\\n were unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all\\n the mirrors in the ship.\\n\\n\\n The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended\\n animation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to\\n mature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came\\n from the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was\\n hungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly,\\n searching for the million-to-one chance.\\n\\n\\n He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was\\n Earth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its\\n worm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But\\n after a time he ceased even to wonder.\\n\\n\\n And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its\\n eager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning\\n hope....\\nPeter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you\\n were searching for.\"\\n\\n\\n His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your\\n brain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid\\'s. You solve\\n instinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours\\n of work. You are a superman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\\n\\n\\n He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he\\n stood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but\\n little in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled\\n over his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of\\n flesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had\\n a tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\\n\\n\\n He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once\\n accidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\\n\\n\\n \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I\\'ve waited so\\n long—keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from\\n you, not telling you, even, about Earth until now—because I had to be\\n sure. But now, the waiting is over.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re still there, I\\'m sure of it—the people, and the Invaders. You\\n can kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive\\n knowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we\\n had a saying: \\'Fight fire with fire.\\' That is the way it will be with\\n you. You are completely, coldly logical, just as\\nthey\\nare. You can\\n understand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What—what did\\n you say?\"\\n\\n\\n I repeated it patiently.\\n\\n\\n \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an\\n instant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his\\n suffering, but I could recognize it.\\n\\n\\n \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just\\n as the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the\\n things which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I\\n went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as\\n the invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are\\n more nearly kin to me than your people.\"\\nPeter\\'s eyes were dull, his limbs slumped. For a moment I thought that\\n the shock had deranged his mind.\\n\\n\\n His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and\\n not my people?\"\\n\\n\\n \"To do so would be illogical.\"\\n\\n\\n He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\n \"No, you don\\'t understand that, either.\"\\n\\n\\n Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I do not understand \\'friend,\\'\" I said.\\n\\n\\n I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal\\n arrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively\\n want to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well,\\n then we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could\\n not comprehend it.\\n\\n\\n I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with\\n an expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that,\\n somehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened\\n to the end that I knew was inevitable.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Who would have\\n financed a study of cyclic periods of the hedgehog? Yet the information\\n gained from that study is vital in cancer research.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When we prove our results that should be of enough practical value for\\n anyone. But those crummy trustees didn\\'t even leave us enough for a\\n field test.\" Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of his\\n forehead. \"I\\'ve been worrying so much about this I\\'ve got the ancestor\\n of all headaches.\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell\\'s blue eyes narrowed and his boyish face took on an expression\\n of demonic intensity. \"Ferris, would you consider—?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No!\" the smaller man yelled. \"You can\\'t expect me to violate\\n professional ethics and test my own discovery on myself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nOur\\ndiscovery,\" Mitchell said politely.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s what I meant to say. But I\\'m not sure it would be completely\\n ethical with even a discovery partly mine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?\\n Our reputations don\\'t go outside our own fields,\" Mitchell said. \"But\\n now Macklin—\"\\n\\n\\n Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein\\n in the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word\\n \"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether\\n his Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been\\n able to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but\\n looked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The\\n government took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the\\n Ideal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\\n\\n\\n For the past seven years Macklin—who\\nwas\\nthe Advanced Studies\\n Department of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a\\n faster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the\\n nearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew\\n that the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of\\nAd\\n astra per aspirin\\n.\\n\\n\\n The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin\\'s health.\\n\\n\\n Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild\\n stroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was\\n known that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of\\n the headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several\\n weeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen\\n around the campus.\\nFerris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the\\n laboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair\\n behind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?\" Ferris demanded,\\n pausing in mid-stride.\\n\\n\\n \"I imagine he will,\" Mitchell said. \"Macklin\\'s always seemed a decent\\n enough fellow when I\\'ve had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees\\n meetings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s always treated me like dirt,\" Ferris said heatedly. \"Everyone on\\n this campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash in\\n their smug faces.\"\\n\\n\\n Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack of\\n scientific detachment.\\n\\n\\n There came a discreet knock on the door.\\n\\n\\n \"Please come in,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. He\\n looked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell\\n suspected that that was his intention.\\n\\n\\n He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. \"Good of you to ask me over,\\n Steven.\"\\n\\n\\n Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris\\' shoulders. \"How have you been,\\n Harold?\"\\n\\n\\n Ferris\\' face flickered between pink and white. \"Fine, thank you,\\n doctor.\"\\n\\n\\n Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. \"Now\\n what\\'s this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep the\\n explanation simple. Biology isn\\'t my field, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell moved around the desk casually. \"Actually, Doctor, we haven\\'t\\n the right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an\\n element of risk.\"\\n\\n\\n The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. \"Now you\\n have me intrigued. What is it all about?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n Macklin nodded. \"That\\'s right, Steven. Migraine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That must be terrible,\" Ferris said. \"All your fine reputation and\\n lavish salary can\\'t be much consolation when that ripping, tearing\\n agony begins, can it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, Harold, it isn\\'t,\" Macklin admitted. \"What does your project have\\n to do with my headaches?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said, \"what would you say the most common complaint\\n of man is?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I would have said the common cold,\" Macklin replied, \"but I suppose\\n from what you have said you mean headaches.\"\\n\"Headaches,\" Mitchell agreed. \"Everybody has them at some time in his\\n life. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by\\n their headaches.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Macklin said.\\n\\n\\n \"But think,\" Ferris interjected, \"what a boon it would be if everyone\\n could be cured of headaches\\nforever\\nby one simple injection.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it\\n would please about everybody else.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular\\n pains,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n \"I see. Are you two saying you\\nhave\\nsuch a shot? Can you cure\\n headaches?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We think we can,\" Ferris said.\\n\\n\\n \"How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?\" Macklin\\n asked. \"I know that much about the subject.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\nare\\na number of different causes for headaches—nervous\\n strain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors,\\n over-indulgence—but there is one\\neffect\\nof all of this, the one real\\n cause of headaches,\" Mitchell announced.\\n\\n\\n \"We have definitely established this for this first time,\" Ferris added.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s fine,\" Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. \"And this effect that\\n produces headaches is?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain,\" Mitchell\\n said eagerly. \"That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the\\n telencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It\\'s caused by an\\n over-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a\\n virus that feeds on pituitrin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean\\n the end of the race as well,\" Macklin said. \"In certain areas it is\\n valuable to have a constriction of blood vessels.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The virus,\" Ferris explained, \"can easily be localized and stabilized.\\n A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral\\n vessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid\\n doesn\\'t create pressure in the cavities of the brain.\"\\n\\n\\n The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. \"If this really\\n works, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn\\'t I? The stuff\\n makes me violently sick to my stomach. But it\\'s better than the\\n migraine. How should I go about removing my curse?\" He reinserted the\\n pipe.\\n\\n\\n \"I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,\" Ferris said. \"Our\\n discovery will work.\"\\n\"Will work,\" Macklin said thoughtfully. \"The operative word. It\\nhasn\\'t\\nworked then?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly it has,\" Ferris said. \"On rats, on chimps....\"\\n\\n\\n \"But not on humans?\" Macklin asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" Mitchell admitted.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Macklin said. \"Well.\" He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm.\\n \"Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors\\n from the Army.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We want you,\" Ferris told him.\\n\\n\\n Macklin coughed. \"I don\\'t want to overestimate my value but the\\n government wouldn\\'t like it very well if I died in the middle of this\\n project. My wife would like it even less.\"\\n\\n\\n Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him\\n mouthing the word\\nyellow\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I know it\\'s a tremendous favor to\\n ask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem.\\n Unless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our\\n studies we can get no more financial backing. We\\nshould\\nrun a\\n large-scale field test. But we haven\\'t the time or money for that.\\n We can cure the headaches of one person and that\\'s the limit of our\\n resources.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m tempted,\" Macklin said hesitantly, \"but the answer is go. I mean\\n \\'\\nno\\n\\'. I\\'d like to help you out, but I\\'m afraid I owe too much to\\n others to take the rest—the risk, I mean.\"\\n\\n\\n Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. \"I really\\n would like to take you up on it. When I start making slips like that it\\n means another attack of migraine. The drilling, grinding pain through\\n my temples and around my eyeballs. The flashes of light, the rioting\\n pools of color playing on the back of my lids. Ugh.\"\\n\\n\\n Ferris smiled. \"Gynergen makes you sick, does it, doctor? Produces\\n nausea, eh? The pain of that turns you almost wrong side out, doesn\\'t\\n it? You aren\\'t much better off with it than without, are you? I\\'ve\\n heard some say they preferred the migraine.\"\\n\\n\\n Macklin carefully arranged his pipe along with the tools he used to\\n tend it in a worn leather case. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"what is the worst\\n that could happen to me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Low blood pressure,\" Ferris said.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not so bad,\" Macklin said. \"How low can it get?\"\\n\\n\\n \"When your heart stops, your blood pressure goes to its lowest point,\"\\n Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n A dew of perspiration had bloomed on Macklin\\'s forehead. \"Is there much\\n risk of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Practically none,\" Mitchell said. \"We have to give you the worst\\n possibilities.\\nAll\\nour test animals survived and seem perfectly happy\\n and contented. As I said, the virus is self-stabilizing. Ferris and I\\n are confident that there is no danger.... But we may be wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n Macklin held his head in both hands. \"Why did you two select\\nme\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re an important man, doctor,\" Ferris said. \"Nobody would care if\\n Mitchell or I cured ourselves of headaches—they might not even believe\\n us if we said we did. But the proper authorities will believe a man\\n of your reputation. Besides, neither of us has a record of chronic\\n migraine. You do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I do,\" Macklin said. \"Very well. Go ahead. Give me your\\n injection.\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell cleared his throat. \"Are you positive, doctor?\" he asked\\n uncertainly. \"Perhaps you would like a few days to think it over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No! I\\'m ready. Go ahead, right now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a simple release,\" Ferris said smoothly.\\n\\n\\n Macklin groped in his pocket for a pen.\\nII\\n\\n\\n \"Ferris!\" Mitchell yelled, slamming the laboratory door behind him.\\n\\n\\n \"Right here,\" the small man said briskly. He was sitting at a work\\n table, penciling notes. \"I\\'ve been expecting you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor—Harold—you shouldn\\'t have given this story to the\\n newspapers,\" Mitchell said. He tapped the back of his hand against the\\n folded paper.\\n\\n\\n \"On the contrary, I should and I did,\" Ferris answered. \"We wanted\\n something dramatic to show to the trustees and here it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, we wanted to show our proof to the trustees—but not broadcast\\n unverified results to the press. It\\'s too early for that!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be so stuffy and conservative, Mitchell! Macklin\\'s cured, isn\\'t\\n he? By established periodic cycle he should be suffering hell right\\n now, shouldn\\'t he? But thanks to our treatment he is perfectly happy,\\n with no unfortunate side effects such as gynergen produces.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a significant test case, yes. But not enough to go to the\\n newspapers with. If it wasn\\'t enough to go to the press with, it wasn\\'t\\n enough to try and breach the trustees with. Don\\'t you see? The public\\n will hand down a ukase demanding our virus, just as they demanded the\\n Salk vaccine and the Grennell serum.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n The shrill call of the telephone interrupted Mitchell\\'s objections.\\n\\n\\n Ferris excused himself and crossed to the instrument. He answered it\\n and listened for a moment, his face growing impatient.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s Macklin\\'s wife,\" Ferris said. \"Do you want to talk to her? I\\'m no\\n good with hysterical women.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hysterical?\" Mitchell muttered in alarm and went to the phone.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello?\" Mitchell said reluctantly. \"Mrs. Macklin?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are the other one,\" the clear feminine voice said. \"Your name is\\n Mitchell.\"\\n\\n\\n She couldn\\'t have sounded calmer or more self-possessed, Mitchell\\n thought.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, Mrs. Macklin. I\\'m Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. Ferris\\'s\\n associate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you have a license to dispense narcotics?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said sharply.\\n\\n\\n \"I used to be a nurse, Dr. Mitchell. I know you\\'ve given my husband\\n heroin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s absurd. What makes you think a thing like that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The—trance he\\'s in now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, Mrs. Macklin. Neither Dr. Ferris or myself have been near your\\n husband for a full day. The effects of a narcotic would have worn off\\n by this time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Most known narcotics,\" she admitted, \"but evidently you have\\n discovered something new. Is it so expensive to refine you and Ferris\\n have to recruit new customers to keep yourselves supplied?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Macklin! I think I had better talk to you later when you are\\n calmer.\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell dropped the receiver heavily. \"What could be wrong with\\n Macklin?\" he asked without removing his hand from the telephone.\\n\\n\\n Ferris frowned, making quotation marks above his nose. \"Let\\'s have a\\n look at the test animals.\"\\n\\n\\n Together they marched over to the cages and peered through the\\n honeycomb pattern of the wire. The test chimp, Dean, was sitting\\n peacefully in a corner scratching under his arms with the back of his\\n knuckles. Jerry, their control in the experiment, who was practically\\n Dean\\'s twin except that he had received no injection of the E-M Virus,\\n was stomping up and down punching his fingers through the wire,\\n worrying the lock on the cage.\\n\\n\\n \"Jerry\\nis\\na great deal more active than Dean,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, but Dean isn\\'t sick. He just doesn\\'t seem to have as much nervous\\n energy to burn up. Nothing wrong with his thyroid either.\"\\n\\n\\n They went to the smaller cages. They found the situation with the rats,\\n Bud and Lou, much the same.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know. Maybe they just have tired blood,\" Mitchell ventured.\\n\\n\\n \"Iron deficiency anemia?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind, doctor. It was a form of humor. I think we had better see\\n exactly what is wrong with Elliot Macklin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s nothing wrong with him,\" Ferris snapped. \"He\\'s probably just\\n trying to get us in trouble, the ingrate!\"\\nMacklin\\'s traditional ranch house was small but attractive in\\n aqua-tinted aluminum.\\n\\n\\n Under Mitchell\\'s thumb the bell chimbed\\ndum-de-de-dum-dum-dum\\n.\\n\\n\\n As they waited Mitchell glanced at Ferris. He seemed completely\\n undisturbed, perhaps slightly curious.\\n\\n\\n The door unlatched and swung back.\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" Mitchell said quickly, \"I\\'m sure we can help if there\\n is anything wrong with your husband. This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr.\\n Mitchell.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You had certainly\\nbetter\\nhelp him, gentlemen.\" She stood out of the\\n doorway for them to pass.\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore\\n an expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline.\\n\\n\\n The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them.\\n\\n\\n \"You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized\\n injection,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t a question.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t like that \\'unauthorized\\',\" Ferris snapped.\\n\\n\\n The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted\\n a heavy eyebrow. \"No? Are you medical doctors? Are you authorized to\\n treat illnesses?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We weren\\'t treating an illness,\" Mitchell said. \"We were discovering a\\n method of treatment. What concern is it of yours?\"\\n\\n\\n The colonel smiled thinly. \"Dr. Macklin is my concern. And everything\\n that happens to him. The Army doesn\\'t like what you have done to him.\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell wondered desperately just what they had done to the man.\\n\\n\\n \"Can we see him?\" Mitchell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Why not? You can\\'t do much worse than murder him now. That might be\\n just as well. We have laws to cover that.\"\\n\\n\\n The colonel led them into the comfortable, over-feminine living room.\\n Macklin sat in an easy chair draped in embroidery, smoking. Mitchell\\n suddenly realized Macklin used a pipe as a form of masculine protest to\\n his home surroundings.\\n\\n\\n On the coffee table in front of Macklin were some odd-shaped building\\n blocks such as were used in nursery schools. A second uniformed\\n man—another colonel but with the snake-entwined staff of the medical\\n corps in his insignia—was kneeling at the table on the marble-effect\\n carpet.\\n\\n\\n The Army physician stood up and brushed his knees, undusted from the\\n scrupulously clean rug.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s wrong with him, Sidney?\" the other officer asked the doctor.\\n\\n\\n \"Not a thing,\" Sidney said. \"He\\'s the healthiest, happiest, most\\n well-adjusted man I\\'ve ever examined, Carson.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\" Colonel Carson protested.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, he\\'s changed all right,\" the Army doctor answered. \"He\\'s not the\\n same man as he used to be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How is he different?\" Mitchell demanded.\\n\\n\\n The medic examined Mitchell and Ferris critically before answering. \"He\\n used to be a mathematical genius.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And now?\" Mitchell said impatiently.\\n\\n\\n \"Now he is a moron,\" the medic said.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n Mitchell tried to stop Colonel Sidney as he went past, but the doctor\\n mumbled he had a report to make.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell and Ferris stared at Colonel Carson and Macklin and at each\\n other.\\n\\n\\n \"What did he mean, Macklin is an idiot?\" Mitchell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not an idiot,\" Colonel Carson corrected primly. \"Dr. Macklin is a\\n moron. He\\'s legally responsible, but he\\'s extremely stupid.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not so dumb,\" Macklin said defensively.\\n\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" Carson said. \"I didn\\'t intend any offense.\\n But according to all the standard intelligence tests we have given you,\\n your clinical intelligence quotient is that of a moron.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s just on book learning,\" Macklin said. \"There\\'s a lot you learn\\n in life that you don\\'t get out of books, son.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m confident that\\'s true, sir,\" Colonel Carson said. He turned to the\\n two biologists. \"Perhaps we had better speak outside.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\" Mitchell said, impatient to examine Macklin for himself. \"Very\\n well. Let\\'s step into the hall.\"\\n\\n\\n Ferris followed them docilely.\\n\\n\\n \"What have you done to him?\" the colonel asked straightforwardly.\\n\\n\\n \"We merely cured him of his headaches,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell did his best to explain the F-M Virus.\\n\\n\\n \"You mean,\" the Army officer said levelly \"you have infected him with\\n some kind of a disease to rot his brain?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, no! Could I talk to the other man, the doctor? Maybe I can make\\n him understand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All I want to know is why Elliot Macklin has been made as simple as if\\n he had been kicked in the head by a mule,\" Colonel Carson said.\\n\\n\\n \"I think I can explain,\" Ferris interrupted.\\n\\n\\n \"You can?\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n Ferris nodded. \"We made a slight miscalculation. It appears as if the\\n virus colony overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in\\n the cerebrum. It isn\\'t more than necessary to stop headaches. But that\\n necessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain\\n cells to function properly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why won\\'t they function?\" Carson roared.\\n\\n\\n \"They don\\'t get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin,\" Ferris\\n explained. \"The cerebral vessels don\\'t contract enough to pump the\\n blood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain\\n cells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying.\"\\n\\n\\n The colonel yelled.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct.\\nThe colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.\\n \"I\\'ll see you hung for treason! Don\\'t you know what Elliot Macklin\\n means to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto\\n before we do? Macklin\\'s formula is essential to the FTL engine. You\\n might just as well have blown up Washington, D.C. Better! The capital\\n is replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly\\n once in a human race.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a moment,\" Mitchell interrupted, \"we can cure Macklin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\ncan\\n?\" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was\\n going to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have\\n antitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a\\n beneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good!\" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the\\n knees.\\n\\n\\n \"Just you wait a second now, boys,\" Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning\\n in the doorway, holding his pipe. \"I\\'ve been listening to what you\\'ve\\n been saying and I don\\'t like it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean you don\\'t like it?\" Carson demanded. He added, \"Sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, doctor,\" Mitchell said eagerly, \"just as you used to be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWith\\nmy headaches, like before?\"\\n\\n\\n Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to\\n frame an answer. \"Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions\\n properly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is\\n a dismal failure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t go that far,\" Ferris remarked cheerfully.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw\\n Macklin slowly shaking his head.\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir!\" the mathematician said. \"I shall not go back to my original\\n state. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying,\\n worrying.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean wondering,\" Mitchell said.\\n\\n\\n Macklin nodded. \"Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing.\\n How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say,\\n what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It\\'s\\n peaceful this way. My head doesn\\'t hurt. I\\'ve got a good-looking wife\\n and all the money I need. I\\'ve got it made. Why worry?\"\\n\\n\\n Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, Colonel. There\\'s no use in arguing with him,\" Mitchell\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not his decision to make,\" the colonel said. \"He\\'s an idiot now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, Colonel. As you said, he\\'s a moron. He seems an idiot compared to\\n his former level of intelligence but he\\'s legally responsible. There\\n are millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They\\n can get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them\\n do. You can\\'t force him into being cured.... At least, I don\\'t\\nthink\\nyou can.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I can\\'t. This is hardly a totalitarian state.\" The colonel looked\\n momentarily glum that it wasn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell looked back at Macklin. \"Where did his wife get to, Colonel?\\n I don\\'t think that even previously he made too many personal decisions\\n for himself. Perhaps she could influence him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" the colonel said. \"Let\\'s find her.\"\\nThey found Mrs. Macklin in the dining room, her face at the picture\\n window an attractive silhouette. She turned as the men approached.\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the colonel began, \"these gentlemen believe they can\\n cure your husband of his present condition.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Really?\" she said. \"Did you speak to Elliot about that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Y-yes,\" Colonel Carson said, \"but he\\'s not himself. He refused the\\n treatment. He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence.\"\\n\\n\\n She nodded. \"If those are his wishes, I can\\'t go against them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Mrs. Macklin!\" Mitchell protested. \"You will have to get a court\\n order overruling your husband\\'s wishes.\"\\n\\n\\n She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. \"That\\n was my original thought. But I\\'ve redecided.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Redecided!\" Carson burst out almost hysterically.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. I can\\'t go against Elliot\\'s wishes. It would be monstrous to put\\n him back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again,\\n where he never had a moment\\'s peace from worry and pressure. He\\'s happy\\n now. Like a child, but happy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Macklin,\" the Army man said levelly, \"if you don\\'t help us\\n restore your husband\\'s mind we will be forced to get a court order\\n declaring him incompetent.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he is not! Legally, I mean,\" the woman stormed.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe not. It\\'s a borderline case. But I think any court would give us\\n the edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once\\n he\\'s certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and\\n Ferris\\' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin\\n to sanity.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband\\'s health, his very life, is\\n involved.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of\\n vascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to\\n give those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To\\n paralyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose there\\'s some chance of that. But without the treatment\\n there is\\nno\\nchance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs.\\n Macklin,\" Mitchell interjected.\\n\\n\\n Her mouth grew petulant. \"I don\\'t care. I would rather have a live\\n husband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him\\n comfortable....\"\\n\\n\\n Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led\\n him back into the hall.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin\\n stupid. Prefers it that way. She\\'s always dominated his personal life,\\n and now she can dominate him completely.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She\\'s an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous\\n of her husband\\'s genius.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what the hell to tell\\n the Pentagon. I think I\\'ll go out and get drunk.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll go with you,\" Ferris said.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.\\n\\n\\n Carson squinted. \"Any particular reason, doctor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"To celebrate,\" Ferris said.\\n\\n\\n The colonel shrugged. \"That\\'s as good a reason as any.\"\\n\\n\\n On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together in\\n bewilderment.\\nIV\\n\\n\\n Macklin was playing jacks.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great\\n curving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto\\n and the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not\\n his head. Mitchell\\'s. Both heads were initialed \"M\" so it was all the\\n same.\\nMitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.\\n\\n\\n He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his\\n heart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from\\n the nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.\\n\\n\\n After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said.\\n\\n\\n Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the\\n phone instead of his wife.\\n\\n\\n \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I mean, are you alone?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she\\'s asleep. That Army\\n doctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn\\'t let him give\\n me anything, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good boy,\" the biologist said. \"Listen, doctor—Elliot—El, old son.\\n I\\'m not against you like all the others. I don\\'t want to make you go\\n back to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me,\\n don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n There was a slight hesitation.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Macklin said, \"if you say so. Why shouldn\\'t I believe you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if\\n I could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve found yourself worrying—thinking—about a lot of other\\n problems since we left you, haven\\'t you? Maybe not the same kind of\\n scientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn\\'t used to\\n have time to think about.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you say so.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, you know it\\'s so. But how would you like to get rid of those\\n worries just as you got rid of the others?\" Mitchell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I\\'d like that,\" the mathematician replied.\\n\\n\\n \"Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it\\'s at, don\\'t\\n you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I—yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won\\'t try to put me\\n back where I was instead of helping me more?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I couldn\\'t do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you say so. But I don\\'t guess I can come anyway. The Army is\\n watching me pretty close.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s alright,\" Mitchell said quickly. \"You can bring along Colonel\\n Carson.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he won\\'t like you fixing me up more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he can\\'t stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me—I\\n want you to come right on over here, El.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you say so,\" Macklin said uncertainly.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

When—boom?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply.\\n\\n\\n \"Boom! Boom!\" said Major Winship in exasperation.\\n\\n\\n \"Boom!\" said Pinov happily.\\n\\n\\n \"When?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Boom—boom!\" said Pinov.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, nuts.\" Major Winship cut out the circuit. \"They\\'ve got Pinov on\\n emergency watch this morning,\" he explained to the other Americans.\\n \"The one that doesn\\'t speak English.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s done it deliberately,\" said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest of the four\\n Americans. \"How are we going to know when it\\'s over?\"\\n\\n\\n No one bothered to respond. They sat for a while in silence while the\\n shadows evaporated. One by one they clicked on their cooling systems.\\n\\n\\n Ultimately, Lt. Chandler said, \"This is a little ridiculous. I\\'m going\\n to switch over to their channel. Rap if you want me.\" He sat transfixed\\n for several minutes. \"Ah, it\\'s all Russian. Jabbering away. I can\\'t\\n tell a thing that\\'s going on.\"\\n\\n\\n In the airless void of the moon, the blast itself would be silent. A\\n moth\\'s wing of dust would, perhaps, rise and settle beyond the horizon:\\n no more.\\n\\n\\n \"Static?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll get static on these things.\"\\n\\n\\n A small infinity seemed to pass very slowly.\\n\\n\\n Major Winship shifted restlessly. \"My reefer\\'s gone on the fritz.\"\\n Perspiration was trickling down his face.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s all go in,\" said the fourth American, Capt. Lawler. \"It\\'s\\n probably over by now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll try again,\" Major Winship said and switched to the emergency\\n channel. \"Base Gagarin? Base Gagarin?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is Pinov. Help?\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nNyet.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pinov\\'s still there,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell him, \\'Help\\',\" said Capt. Wilkins, \"so he\\'ll get somebody we can\\n talk to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll see them all in hell, first,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, the perspiration was rivers across his face. \"This\\n is it,\" he said. \"I\\'m going in.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s all—\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. I\\'ve got to cool off.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Charlie, I feel stupid sitting out here,\" Capt. Lawler said.\\n \"The shot probably went off an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The static level hasn\\'t gone up much, if at all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"it\\'s buried too deep.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe so,\" Major Winship said. \"But we can\\'t have the dome fall down\\n around all our ears.\" He stood. \"Whew! You guys stay put.\"\\nHe crossed with the floating moon-motion to the airlock and entered,\\n closing the door behind him. The darkness slowly filled with air, and\\n the temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper moment\\n of pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped into\\n the illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second step\\n when the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward,\\n off balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated beside\\n the radio equipment. The ground moved again.\\n\\n\\n \"Charlie! Charlie!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m okay,\" Major Winship answered. \"Okay! Okay!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s—\"\\n\\n\\n There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, Les, how\\'s it look?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Major Winship said. \"We told them this might happen,\" he added\\n bitterly.\\n\\n\\n There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding their\\n breath.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess it\\'s over,\" said Major Winship, getting to his feet. \"Wait a\\n bit more, there may be an after-shock.\" He switched once again to the\\n emergency channel.\\n\\n\\n \"Is Pinov,\" came the supremely relaxed voice. \"Help?\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship whinnied in disgust. \"\\nNyet!\\n\" he snarled. To the other\\n Americans: \"Our comrades seem unconcerned.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tough.\"\\n\\n\\n They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled and\\n snapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at each\\n other. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communications\\n completely. It then abated to something in excess of normal.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Lt. Chandler commented, \"even though we didn\\'t build this thing\\n to withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I was just—\" Major Winship began. \"Oh, hell! We\\'re losing\\n pressure. Where\\'s the markers?\"\\n\\n\\n \"By the lug cabinet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Got \\'em,\" Major Winship said a moment later.\\n\\n\\n He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it away\\n and plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed as\\n though it were breathing and then it ruptured.\\n\\n\\n Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply which\\n had cut in automatically with the pressure drop. \"You guys wait. It\\'s\\n on your right side, midway up. I\\'ll try to sheet it.\"\\n\\n\\n He moved for the plastic sheeting.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve lost about three feet of calk out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"I\\n can see more ripping loose. You\\'re losing pressure fast at this rate.\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. \"How\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It\\'s\\n sprung a little, and I can\\'t get it to conform over the rivet heads.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a splatter of static.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn!\" Major Winship said, \"they should have made these things more\\n flexible.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Still coming out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Best I can do.\" Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowly\\n to slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on the\\n floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Come on in,\" he said dryly.\\nWith the four of them inside, it was somewhat cramped. Most of the\\n five hundred square feet was filled with equipment. Electrical cables\\n trailed loosely along the walls and were festooned from the ceiling,\\n radiating from the connections to the outside solar cells. The living\\n space was more restricted than in a submarine, with the bunks jutting\\n out from the walls about six feet from the floor.\\n\\n\\n Lt. Chandler mounted one of the bunks to give them more room. \"Well,\"\\n he said wryly, \"it doesn\\'t smell as bad now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oops,\" said Major Winship. \"Just a second. They\\'re coming in.\" He\\n switched over to the emergency channel. It was General Finogenov.\\n\\n\\n \"Major Winship! Hello! Hello, hello, hello. You A Okay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is Major Winship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh! Excellent, very good. Any damage, Major?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Little leak. You?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Came through without damage.\" General Finogenov paused a moment. When\\n no comment was forthcoming, he continued: \"Perhaps we built a bit more\\n strongly, Major.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You did this deliberately,\" Major Winship said testily.\\n\\n\\n \"No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Major Winship, please believe me. I very\\n much regret this. Very much so. I am very distressed. Depressed. After\\n repeatedly assuring you there was no danger of a quake—and then to\\n have something like this happen. Oh, this is very embarrassing to me.\\n Is there anything at all we can do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just leave us alone, thank you,\" Major Winship said and cut off the\\n communication.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'d they say?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Larry, General Finogenov said he was very embarrassed by this.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s nice,\" Lt. Chandler said.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be damned surprised,\" Major Winship said, \"if they got any\\n seismic data out of that shot.... Well, to hell with them, let\\'s get\\n this leak fixed. Skip, can you get the calking compound?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Larry, where\\'s the inventory?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Les has got it.\"\\n\\n\\n Lt. Chandler got down from the bunk and Capt. Wilkins mounted.\\n\\n\\n \"Larry,\" Major Winship said, \"why don\\'t you get Earth?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins got down from the bunk and Capt. Lawler ascended.\\n\\n\\n \"Got the inventory sheet, Les?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right here.\"\\n\\n\\n Squeezed in front of the massive transmitter, Capt. Wilkins had\\n energized the circuits. There was a puzzled look on his face. He leaned\\n his helmet against the speaker and then shook his head sadly. \"We can\\'t\\n hear anything without any air.\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship looked at the microphone. \"Well, I\\'ll just report and—\"\\n He started to pick up the microphone and reconsidered. \"Yes,\" he said.\\n \"That\\'s right, isn\\'t it.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins flicked off the transmitter. \"Some days you don\\'t mine at\\n all,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Les, have you found it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s around here somewhere. Supposed to be back here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\\nfind\\nit.\"\\n\\n\\n Lt. Chandler began moving boxes. \"I saw it—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Skip, help look.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Lawler got down from the bunk and Major Winship mounted. \"We\\n haven\\'t got all day.\"\\n\\n\\n A few minutes later, Lt. Chandler issued the triumphant cry. \"Here it\\n is! Dozen tubes. Squeeze tubes. It\\'s the new stuff.\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship got down and Capt. Wilkins got up.\\n\\n\\n \"Marker showed it over here,\" Major Winship said, inching over to the\\n wall. He traced the leak with a metallic finger.\\n\\n\\n \"How does this stuff work?\" Capt. Lawler asked.\\n\\n\\n They huddled over the instruction sheet.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s see. Squeeze the tube until the diaphragm at the nozzle\\n ruptures. Extrude paste into seam. Allow to harden one hour before\\n service.\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship said dryly, \"Never mind. I notice it hardens on contact\\n with air.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins lay back on the bunk and stared upward. He said, \"Now\\n that makes a weird kind of sense, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How do they possibly think—?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen! It doesn\\'t make any difference,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"Some\\n air must already have leaked into this one. It\\'s hard as a rock. A\\n gorilla couldn\\'t extrude it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'re the other ones?\" asked Major Winship.\\n\\n\\n Lt. Chandler turned and made a quick examination. \"Oh, they\\'re all\\n hard, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who was supposed to check?\" demanded Capt. Wilkins in exasperation.\\n\\n\\n \"The only way you can check is to extrude it,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"and\\n if it does extrude, you\\'ve ruined it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s that,\" Major Winship said. \"There\\'s nothing for it but to yell\\n help.\"\\nII\\n\\n\\n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler took the land car to Base Gagarin. The\\n Soviet base was situated some ten miles toward sunset at the bottom of\\n a natural fold in the surface. The route was moderately direct to the\\n tip of the gently rolling ridge. At that point, the best pathway angled\\n left and made an S-shaped descent to the basin. It was a one-way trip\\n of approximately thirty exhausting minutes.\\n\\n\\n Major Winship, with his deficient reefer, remained behind. Capt.\\n Wilkins stayed for company.\\n\\n\\n \"I want a cigarette in the worst way,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n \"So do I, Larry. Shouldn\\'t be more than a couple of hours. Unless\\n something else goes wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As long as they\\'ll loan us the calking compound,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s eat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You got any concentrate? I\\'m empty.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll load you,\" Capt. Wilkins volunteered wearily.\\n\\n\\n It was an awkward operation that took several minutes. Capt. Wilkins\\n cursed twice during the operation. \"I\\'d hate to live in this thing for\\n any period.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think these suits are one thing we\\'ve got over the Russians,\" Major\\n Winship said. \"I don\\'t see how they can manipulate those bulky pieces\\n of junk around.\"\\n\\n\\n They ate.\\n\\n\\n \"Really horrible stuff.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nutritious.\"\\n\\n\\n After the meal, Major Winship said reflectively, \"Now I\\'d like a cup of\\n hot tea. I\\'m cooled off.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins raised eyebrows. \"What brought this on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was just thinking.... They really got it made, Larry. They\\'ve got\\n better than three thousand square feet in the main dome and better than\\n twelve hundred square feet in each of the two little ones. And there\\'s\\n only seven of them right now. That\\'s living.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve been here six years longer, after all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Finogenov had a\\nclay\\nsamovar sent up. Lemon and nutmeg, too. Real,\\n by God, fresh lemons for the tea, the last time I was there. His own\\n office is about ten by ten. Think of that. One hundred square feet. And\\n a wooden desk. A\\nwooden\\ndesk. And a chair. A wooden chair. Everything\\n big and heavy. Everything. Weight, hell. Fifty pounds more or less—\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve got the power-plants for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you think he did that deliberately?\" Major Winship asked. \"I think\\n he\\'s trying to force us off. I think he hoped for the quake. Gagarin\\'s\\n built to take it, I\\'ll say that. Looks like it, anyhow. You don\\'t\\n suppose they planned this all along? Even if they didn\\'t, they sure got\\n the jump on us again, didn\\'t they? I told you what he told me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You told me,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\nAfter a moment, Major Winship said bitterly, \"To hell with the Russian\\n engineer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'ve got all that power....\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the thing. That\\'s the thing that gripes me, know what I mean?\\n It\\'s just insane to send up a heavy wooden desk. That\\'s showing off.\\n Like a little kid.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe they don\\'t make aluminum desks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve—got—aluminum. Half of everything on the whole planet is\\n aluminum. You know they\\'re just showing off.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me wire you up,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"We ought to report.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s going to take awhile.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s something to do while we wait.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I guess we ought to.\" Major Winship came down from the bunk and\\n sat with his back toward the transmitter. Capt. Wilkins slewed the\\n equipment around until the emergency jacks were accessible. He\\n unearthed the appropriate cable and began unscrewing the exterior\\n plate to the small transmitter-receiver set on Major Winship\\'s back.\\n Eventually, trailing wires, Major Winship was coupled into the network.\\n \"Okay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Major Winship gestured.\\n\\n\\n They roused Earth.\\n\\n\\n \"This is Major Charles Winship, Commanding Officer, Freedom 19, the\\n American moonbase.\"\\n\\n\\n At this point, Major Winship observed for the first time that he was\\n now on emergency air. He started to ask Capt. Wilkins to change his\\n air bottle, but then he realized his communications were cut off. He\\n reached over and rapped Capt. Wilkins\\' helmet.\\n\\n\\n \"This is the Cape. Come in, Major Winship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a moment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is everything all right?\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship was squirming nervously, obviously perturbed.\\n\\n\\n \"A-Okay,\" he said. \"Just a moment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s wrong?\" came the worried question. In the background, he heard\\n someone say, \"I think there\\'s something wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins peered intently. Major Winship contorted his face in a\\n savage grimace.\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins raised his eyebrows in alarm. They were face to face\\n through their helmets, close together. Each face appeared monstrously\\n large to the other.\\n\\n\\n Major Winship made a strangling motion and reached for his throat. One\\n arm tangled a cable and jerked the speaker jack loose. Major Winship\\n could no longer hear the alarmed expressions from the Cape. The effort\\n was not entirely subvocal, since he emitted a little gasping cry in\\n involuntary realism.\\n\\n\\n This, in the course of some 90 seconds, was transmitted to Earth.\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins\\'s lips were desperately forming the word \"Leak?\"\\n\\n\\n Air, Major Winship said silently.\\n\\n\\n Leak?\\n\\n\\n Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It was a frog-like, unvocal expletive.\\nComprehension dawned. Capt. Wilkins nodded and started to turn away.\\n Major Winship caught his arm and nodded his head toward the loose jack.\\n\\n\\n Oh.\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins nodded and smiled. He reached across and plugged the\\n speaker in again.\\n\\n\\n \"... Freedom 19! Hello, Freedom 19! Come in!\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re here,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"All right? Are you all right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re all right. A-Okay.\" Major Winship, mindful of the extent of his\\n potential audience, took a deep breath. \"Earlier this morning, the\\n Soviet Union fired an underground atomic device for the\\nostensible\\npurpose of investigating the composition of the lunar mass by means of\\n seismic analysis of the resultant shock waves. This was done in spite\\n of American warnings that such a disturbance might release accumulated\\n stresses in the long undisturbed satellite, and was done in the face of\\n vigorous American protests.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins tapped his helmet and gestured for him to swivel around.\\n The turn was uncomfortably tight and complicated by the restraining\\n cables. Capt. Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle.\\n\\n\\n \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued.\\n \"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to\\n withstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface. No\\n personnel were injured and there was no equipment damage.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins tapped his shoulder to indicate the new air bottle was\\n being inserted. Another tap indicated it was seated. Major Winship\\n flicked the appropriate chest button and nodded in appreciation.\\n\\n\\n \"However,\" he continued, \"we did experience a minor leak in the dome,\\n which is presently being repaired.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Soviet Union,\" came the reply, \"has reported the disturbance and\\n has tendered their official apology. You want it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can wait until later. Send it by mail for all I care. Vacuum has\\n destroyed our organic air reconditioner. We have approximately three\\n weeks of emergency air. However, Base Gagarin reports no damage, so\\n that, in the event we exhaust our air, we will be able to obtain the\\n necessary replacement.\"\\n\\n\\n The wait of a little better than three seconds for the response gave\\n the conversation a tone of deliberation.\\n\\n\\n A new voice came on. \"We tried to contact you earlier, Major. We will\\n be able to deliver replacements in about ten days.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I will forward a coded report on the occurrence,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"Let us hear from you again in ... about three hours. Is the leak\\n repaired?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The leak has not yet been repaired. Over and out.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded to Capt. Wilkins and leaned back.\\n\\n\\n Methodically, Capt. Wilkins set about disconnecting the major from the\\n transmitter.\\n\\n\\n \"Wow!\" said Major Winship when he was once more in communication. \"For\\n a moment there, I thought....\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" Capt. Wilkins asked with interest.\\n\\n\\n \"I could see myself asking them to ask the Russians to ask Finogenov\\n to get on the emergency channel to ask you to charge the air bottle.\\n I never felt so ... idiotic is not quite strong enough ... there for a\\n minute in my whole life. I didn\\'t know how much emergency air was left,\\n and I thought, my God, I\\'ll never live this down. All the hams in the\\n world listening, while I try to explain the situation. I could see the\\n nickname being entered in my files: aka. The Airless Idiot. I tell you,\\n that was rough.\"\\nIII\\n\\n\\n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler returned with the calking compound. It\\n occupied the rear section of the land car. Lt. Chandler sat atop it. It\\n was a fifty-five gallon drum.\\n\\n\\n The airlock to Freedom 19 was open. \"What is\\nthat\\n?\" asked Major\\n Winship, squinting out into the glaring sunlight.\\n\\n\\n \"That,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"is the calking compound.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re kidding,\" said Capt. Wilkins.\\n\\n\\n \"I am not kidding.\"\\n\\n\\n Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler came inside. Capt. Wilkins mounted a bunk.\\n\\n\\n \"Why didn\\'t you just borrow a cupful?\" Major Winship said sarcastically.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s this way,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"They didn\\'t have anything but\\n 55-gallon drums of it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, my,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I suppose it\\'s a steel drum. Those\\n things must weigh....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Actually, I think you guys have got the general wrong,\" Capt. Lawler\\n said. \"He was out, himself, to greet us. I think he was really quite\\n upset by the quake. Probably because his people had misfigured so bad.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s too damned suspicious,\" Major Winship said. \"You know and I know\\n why they set that blast off. I tried to tell him. Hell. He looks at me\\n like an emasculated owl and wants to know our ulterior motive in trying\\n to prevent a purely scientific experiment, the results of which will be\\n published in the technical press for the good of everybody. I\\'ll bet!\"\\n\\n\\n \"About this drum,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, like I said, it\\'s this way,\" Lt. Chandler resumed. \"I told him\\n we needed about a pint. Maybe a quart. But this stuff you have to mix\\n up. He only had these drums. There\\'s two parts to it, and you have to\\n combine them in just the right proportion. He told me to take a little\\n scale—\"\\n\\n\\n \"A little scale?\" asked Capt. Wilkins, rolling his eyes at the dome.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s what I told him. We don\\'t have any little scale.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Captain Lawler, \"and he looked at us with that mute,\\n surprised look, like everybody, everywhere has dozens of little\\n scales.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, anyway,\" Lt. Chandler continued, \"he told us just to mix up the\\n whole fifty-five gallon drum. There\\'s a little bucket of stuff that\\n goes in, and it\\'s measured just right. We can throw away what we don\\'t\\n need.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Somehow, that sounds like him,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"He had five or six of them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jesus!\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"That must be\\nthree thousand pounds\\nof\\n calking compound. Those people are insane.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The question is,\" Capt. Lawler said, \"\\'How are we going to mix it?\\'\\n It\\'s supposed to be mixed thoroughly.\"\\n\\n\\n They thought over the problem for a while.\\n\\n\\n \"That will be a man-sized job,\" Major Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s see, Charlie. Maybe not too bad,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"If I took\\n the compressor motor, we could make up a shaft and ... let\\'s see ... if\\n we could....\"\\nIt took the better part of an hour to rig up the electric mixer.\\n\\n\\n Capt. Wilkins was profusely congratulated.\\n\\n\\n \"Now,\" Major Winship said, \"we can either bring the drum inside or take\\n the mixer out there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re going to have to bring the drum in,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"that will make it nice and cozy.\"\\n\\n\\n It took the four of them to roll the drum inside, rocking it back and\\n forth through the airlock. At that time, it was apparent the table was\\n interposing itself.\\n\\n\\n Lt. Chandler tried to dismantle the table. \"Damn these suits,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got it stuck between the bunk post.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\nknow\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think this is the way to do it,\" Major Winship said. \"Let\\'s\\n back the drum out.\"\\n\\n\\n Reluctantly, they backed the drum out and deposited it. With the aid of\\n Capt. Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the table unstuck. They passed it over\\n to Major Winship, who handed it out to Capt. Wilkins. Captain Wilkins\\n carried it around the drum of calking compound and set it down. It\\n rested uneasily on the uneven surface.\\n\\n\\n \"Now, let\\'s go,\" said Major Winship.\\n\\n\\n Eventually, they accomplished the moving. They wedged the drum between\\n the main air-supply tank and the transmitter. They were all perspiring.\\n \"It\\'s not the weight, it\\'s the mass,\" said Capt. Wilkins brightly.\\n\\n\\n \"The hell it isn\\'t the weight,\" said Lt. Chandler. \"That\\'s heavy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"With my reefer out,\" said Major Winship, \"I\\'m the one it\\'s rough on.\"\\n He shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"They should figure a way to get\\n a mop in here, or a towel, or a sponge, or something. I\\'ll bet you\\'ve\\n forgotten how much sweat stings in the eyes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s the salt.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Speaking of salt. I wish I had some salt tablets,\" Major Winship said.\\n \"I\\'ve never sweat so much since basic.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Want to bet Finogenov hasn\\'t got a bushel of them?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No!\" Major Winship snapped.\\nWith the drum of calking compound inside, both Capt. Lawler and Lt.\\n Chandler retreated to the bunks. Capt. Wilkins maneuvered the mixing\\n attachment. \"I feel crowded,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Cozy\\'s the word.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Watch it! Watch it! You almost hit me in the face plate with that!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n\\n At length the mixer was in operation in the drum.\\n\\n\\n \"Works perfectly,\" said Capt. Wilkins proudly.\\n\\n\\n \"Now what, Skip? The instructions aren\\'t in English.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re supposed to dump the bucket of stuff in. Then clean the area\\n thoroughly around the leak.\"\\n\\n\\n \"With what?\" asked Major Winship.\\n\\n\\n \"Sandpaper, I guess.\"\\n\\n\\n \"With sandpaper?\" Major Winship said, emptying the bucket of fluid into\\n the drum. \"We don\\'t have any sandpaper.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s been a long day,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n \"Mix it thoroughly,\" Lt. Chandler mused. \"I guess that means let it mix\\n for about ten minutes or so. Then you apply it. It sets for service in\\n just a little bit, Finogenov said. An hour or so, maybe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hope this doesn\\'t set on exposure to air.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"It sets by some kind of chemical action.\\n General Finogenov wasn\\'t sure of the English name for it. Some kind of\\n plastic.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s come back to how we\\'re going to clean around the leak,\" Major\\n Winship said.\\n\\n\\n \"Say, I—\" interrupted Capt. Wilkins. There was a trace of concern\\n in his voice. \"This is a hell of a time for this to occur to\\n me. I just wasn\\'t thinking, before.\\nYou don\\'t suppose it\\'s a\\n room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, do you?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"Larry,\" said Major Winship, \"I wouldn\\'t know a room-temperature-curing\\n epoxy resin from—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey!\" exclaimed Capt. Wilkins. \"The mixer\\'s stopped.\" He bent forward\\n and touched the drum. He jerked back. \"Ye Gods! that\\'s hot! And it\\'s\\n harder than a rock! It\\nis\\nan epoxy! Let\\'s get out of here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Out! Out!\"\\n\\n\\n Major Winship, Lt. Chandler, and Capt. Lawler, recognizing the sense of\\n urgency, simultaneously glanced at the drum. It was glowing cherry red.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go!\" Capt. Wilkins said.\\n\\n\\n He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became\\n temporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly\\n in the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the\\n necessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them\\n from behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms\\n and legs.\\n\\n\\n At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right.\\n The table remained untouched.\\n\\n\\n When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off\\n like shrapnel.\" They obeyed.\\n\\n\\n \"What—what—what?\" Capt. Lawler stuttered.\\n\\n\\n They were still separated, two on one side of the airlock, two on the\\n other.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to try to look,\" Capt. Wilkins said. \"Let me go.\" He\\n lumbered directly away from the dome for a distance of about fifteen\\n feet, then turned and positioned himself, some five feet behind the\\n table, on a line of sight with the airlock.\\n\\n\\n \"I can see it,\" he said. \"It\\'s getting redder. It\\'s ... it\\'s ...\\n melting, yes. Melting down at the bottom a little. Now it\\'s falling\\n over to one side and laying on the air tank. The air tank is getting\\n red, too. I\\'m afraid ... it\\'s weakening it.... Redder. Oh, oh.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" said Capt. Lawler.\\n\\n\\n \"Watch out! There.\\nThere!\\n\" Capt. Wilkins leaped from his position.\\n He was still floating toward the ground when there was an incredibly\\n bright flare from inside the dome, and a great, silent tongue of flame\\n lashed through the airlock and rolled across the lunar surface. The\\n table was sent tumbling. The flame was gone almost instantly.\\n\"There went the air,\" Capt. Lawler commented.\\n\\n\\n \"We got T-Trouble,\" said Lt. Chandler.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Kalvin Feetch shrunk visibly.\\n\\n\\n \"As chief engineer you\\'re not carrying the ball,\" Piltdon went on\\n savagely. \"The Piltdon Can-Opener is trailing the competition.\\n Advertising and Sales are breaking their necks. It\\'s Engineering\\n that\\'s missing the boat!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Mr. Piltdon,\" remonstrated Feetch unsteadily under his employer\\'s\\n glare, \"don\\'t you remember? I tried to....\"\\n\\n\\n \"For two years there hasn\\'t been one lousy improvement in the Piltdon\\n Can-Opener!\" roared Mr. Piltdon. \"Look at our competitors. The\\n International rips apart cans in three and three-tenths seconds.\\n Universal does it in four.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Mr. Piltdon—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Minerva Mighty Midget does it in four point two two and plays Home\\n Sweet Home in chimes. Our own Piltdon opener barely manages to open a\\n can in eight point nine without chimes. Is this what I\\'m paying you\\n for?\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch adjusted his spectacles with shaking hands. \"But Mr. Piltdon,\\n our opener still has stability, solidity. It is built to last. It has\\n dignity....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dignity,\" pronounced Piltdon, \"is for museums. Four months, Feetch!\\n In four months I want a new can-opener that will be faster, lighter,\\n stronger, flashier and more musical than any other on the market. I\\n want it completely developed, engineered and tooled-up, ready for\\n production. Otherwise, Feetch—\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch\\'s body twitched. \"But Mr. Piltdon, four months is hardly time\\n enough for development, even with an adequate staff. I\\'ve been trying\\n to tell you for years that we\\'re bound to fall behind because we don\\'t\\n have enough personnel to conduct research. Our men can barely keep\\n up with production and maintenance. If you would let me put on a few\\n draftsmen and....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Excuses,\" sneered Mr. Piltdon. \"Your staff is more than adequate.\\n I will not allow you to throw out my money. Four months, Feetch,\\n no more!\" Piltdon trudged out of the room, leaving behind him an\\n oppressive silence.\\n\\n\\n How could you set a time limit on research and development? A designer\\n had to dream at his board, investigate, search, build, test, compare,\\n discard. He had always wanted to devote all his time to research, but\\n Piltdon Opener had not given him that opportunity. Twenty-five years!\\n thought Feetch. Twenty-five years of close supervision, dead-lines,\\n production headaches, inadequate facilities and assistance. What had\\n happened, to the proud dream he once had, the dream of exploring\\n uncharted engineering regions, of unlimited time to investigate and\\n develop?\\n\\n\\n Ah, well, thought Feetch straightening his thin shoulders, he had\\n managed somehow to design a few good things during his twenty-five\\n years with Piltdon. That was some satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n What now? He had to hang on to his job. Technical work was scarce.\\n Since the early 1980\\'s the schools had been turning out more\\n technicians than industry could absorb. He was too old to compete in\\n the employment market. He couldn\\'t afford to lose any money. Jenny\\n wasn\\'t well.\\n\\n\\n How to meet this four month dead-line? He would get right on it\\n himself, of course; Hanson—good man—could work with him. He shook his\\n head despairingly. Something would be sure to blow up. Well, he had to\\n start—\\n\"Chief,\" said Hanson a few weeks later as they entered the lab, \"I\\'m\\n beginning to wonder if the answer is in the hand mechanical type at\\n all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Got to be,\" answered Feetch tiredly. \"We must work along classical\\n can-opener lines. Departures, such as the thermal or motor-driven\\n types, would be too expensive for mass production.\"\\n\\n\\n Three new models and a group of cans were waiting for them on the\\n bench. They began testing, Hanson operating the openers and Feetch\\n clocking. \"Four point four,\" announced Feetch after the last test.\\n \"Good, but not good enough. Too bulky. Appearance unsatisfactory.\\n Chimes tinny. We\\'ve made progress, but we\\'ve a long way to go.\"\\n\\n\\n The problem was tricky. It might seem that use of the proper gear\\n ratios would give the required velocity, but there were too many\\n other factors that negated this direct approach. The mechanism had to\\n be compact and streamlined. Gear sizes had to be kept down. Can-top\\n resistance, internal resistance, cutting tooth performance, handle\\n size and moment, the minimum strength of a woman\\'s hand were some of\\n the variables that had to be balanced within rigid limits. Sector\\n type cutters, traversing several arcs at the same time, had seemed to\\n offer the answer for a while, but the adjusting mechanism necessary to\\n compensate for variable can sizes had been too complex to be practical.\\n There was the ever-present limit to production cost.\\n\\n\\n Hanson\\'s eyes were upon him. \"Chief,\" he said, \"it\\'s a rotten shame.\\n Twenty-five years of your life you put in with Piltdon, and he\\'d fire\\n you just like that if you don\\'t do the impossible. The Piltdon Company\\n is built upon your designs and you get handed this deal!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" said Feetch. \"I drew my pay every week so I suppose I\\n have no complaints. Although,\" a wistful note crept into his voice \"I\\n would have liked a little recognition. Piltdon is a household word,\\n but who has heard of Feetch? Well,\"—Feetch blew his nose—\"how do we\\n stand, Hanson?\"\\n\\n\\n Hanson\\'s bull-dog features drew into a scowl. \"Piltdon ought to\\n be rayed,\" he growled. \"O.K., Chief. Eleven experimental models\\n designed to date. Two more on the boards. Nine completed and tested,\\n two in work. Best performance, four point four, but model otherwise\\n unsatisfactory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hello,\" said Feetch as an aproned machinist entered carrying a\\n glistening mechanism. \"Here\\'s another model. Let\\'s try it.\" The\\n machinist departed and Hanson locked the opener on a can. \"I hope——\"\\n he turned the handle, and stopped abruptly, staring down open-mouthed.\\n\\n\\n A cylinder of close-packed beans rested on the bench under the opener.\\n\\n\\n The can itself had disappeared.\\n\\n\\n \"Chief,\" said Hanson. \"Chief.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Feetch. \"I see it too. Try another can.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Vegetable soup or spinach?\" inquired Hanson dreamily.\\n\\n\\n \"Spinach, I think,\" said Feetch. \"Where did the can go, do you suppose?\"\\n\\n\\n The spinach can disappeared. Likewise several corn cans, sweet potato\\n cans and corned-beef hash cans, leaving their contents intact. It was\\n rather disconcerting.\\n\\n\\n \"Dear, dear,\" said Feetch, regarding the piles of food on the bench.\\n \"There must be some explanation. I designed this opener with sixteen\\n degree, twenty-two minute pressure angle modified involute gear\\n teeth, seven degree, nineteen minute front clearance cutter angle and\\n thirty-six degree, twelve minute back rake angle. I expected that such\\n departures from the norm might achieve unconventional performance, but\\n this—Dear, dear. Where do the cans go, I wonder?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the difference? Don\\'t you see what you\\'ve got here? It\\'s the\\n answer! It\\'s more than the answer! We can put this right into work and\\n beat the dead-line.\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch shook his head. \"No, Hanson. We\\'re producing something we don\\'t\\n understand. What forces have we uncovered here? Where do the cans go?\\n What makes them disappear? Are we dealing with a kinetic or a kinematic\\n effect? What motions can we plot in the area of disappearance and what\\n are their analytical mathematical formulae? What masses may be critical\\n here? What transformations of energy are involved? No, Hanson, we must\\n learn a lot more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Chief, your job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll risk that. Not a word to Piltdon.\"\\n\\n\\n Several days later, however, Piltdon himself charged into the drawing\\n room and slapped Feetch heartily on the back, causing him to break a\\n pencil point. \"Feetch!\" roared Piltdon. \"Is this talk that\\'s going\\n around the plant true? Why didn\\'t you tell me? Let\\'s see it.\"\\n\\n\\n After Piltdon had seen it his eyes took on a feverish glint. \"This,\"\\n he exulted, \"will make can-opener history. Instantaneous opening!\\n Automatic disposal! Wait until Advertising and Sales get hold of this!\\n We\\'ll throttle our competitors! The Piltdon Super-Opener we\\'ll call it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Piltdon—\" said Feetch shakily.\\n\\n\\n Piltdon stared at his chief engineer sharply. \"What\\'s the matter,\\n Feetch? The thing can be duplicated, can\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. I\\'ve just finished checking that. But I\\'m in the midst of\\n further investigation of the effect. There\\'s more here than just a new\\n type can-opener, sir. A whole new field of physics. New principles.\\n This is big, Mr. Piltdon. I recommend that we delay production until\\n further research can be completed. Hire a few top scientists and\\n engineers. Find out where the cans go. Put out a scientific paper on\\n the effect.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Feetch,\" bit out Piltdon, his face growing hard. \"Stow this hooey. I\\n don\\'t give a damn where the cans go. May I remind you that under our\\n standard patent agreement, all rights to your invention belong to the\\n company? As well as anything you may produce in the field within a year\\n after leaving our employ? We have a good thing here, and I don\\'t want\\n you holding it back. We\\'re going into production immediately.\"\\nClose, thought Feetch, wearily. It had been a man-killing job, and it\\n had been close, but he\\'d made it. Beat the time limit by a half-day.\\n The first tentative shipments of Piltdon Super-Openers had gone to\\n distributors along the Eastern seaboard. The first advertisements\\n blazed in selected media. The first reorders came back, and then: \"It\\'s\\n a sell-out!\" crowed Piltdon, waving a sheaf of telegrams. \"Step up\\n production! Let \\'er rip!\"\\n\\n\\n The Super-Openers rolled over the country. In a remarkably short time\\n they appeared in millions of kitchens from coast-to-coast. Sales\\n climbed to hundreds of thousands per day. Piltdon Opener went into\\n peak production in three shifts, but was still unable to keep up with\\n the demand. Construction was begun on a new plant, and additional\\n plants were planned. Long lines waited in front of houseware stores.\\n Department stores, lucky enough to have Super-Openers on hand, limited\\n sales to one to a customer. Piltdon cancelled his advertising program.\\n Newspapers, magazines, radio, television and word-of-mouth spread the\\n fame of the opener so that advertising was unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n Meanwhile, of course, government scientists, research foundations,\\n universities and independent investigators began to look into this new\\n phenomonen. Receiving no satisfactory explanation from Piltdon, they\\n set up their own research.\\n\\n\\n Far into the night burned the lights of countless laboratories. Noted\\n physicists probed, measured, weighed, traced, X-rayed, dissolved,\\n spun, peered at, photographed, magnetized, exploded, shattered and\\n analyzed Super-Openers without achieving the glimmer of a satisfactory\\n explanation. Competitors found the patent impossible to circumvent, for\\n any departure from its exact specifications nullified the effect.\\n\\n\\n Piltdon, genial these days with success and acclaim, roared at Feetch:\\n \"I\\'m putting you in for a raise. Yes sir! To reward you for assisting\\n me with my invention I\\'m raising your pay two hundred dollars a year.\\n That\\'s almost four dollars a week, man.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you, Mr. Piltdon.\" And still, thought Feetch wryly, he received\\n no recognition. His name did not even appear on the patent. Well,\\n well, that was the way it went. He must find his satisfaction in his\\n work. And it had been interesting lately, the work he had been doing\\n nights at home investigating what had been named the Piltdon Effect.\\n It had been difficult, working alone and buying his own equipment. The\\n oscillator and ultra microwave tracking unit had been particularly\\n expensive. He was a fool, he supposed, to try independent research when\\n so many huge scientific organizations were working on it. But he could\\n no more keep away from it than he could stop eating.\\n\\n\\n He still didn\\'t know where the cans went, but somehow he felt that he\\n was close to the answer.\\n\\n\\n When he finally found the answer, it was too late. The Borenchuck\\n incident was only hours away.\\n\\n\\n As soon as he could get hold of Piltdon, Feetch said trembling, \"Sir, I\\n think I know where those cans are going. I recommend—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you still worrying about that?\" Piltdon roared jovially. \"Leave\\n that to the long-hairs. We\\'re making money, that\\'s all that counts, eh\\n Feetch?\"\\nThat night, at six-ten p.m., the Borenchuck family of Selby, South\\n Dakota, sat down to their evening meal. Just as they started in on the\\n soup, a rain of empty tin cans clattered down, splashed into the soup,\\n raised a welt on the forehead of Borenchuck senior, settled down to a\\n gentle, steady klunk! klunk! klunk! and inexorably began to pile up on\\n the dining-room floor. They seemed to materialize from a plane just\\n below the ceiling. The police called the fire department and the fire\\n department stared helplessly and recommended the sanitation department.\\nThe incident made headlines in the local papers.\\n\\n\\n The next day other local papers in widely scattered locations reported\\n similar incidents.\\n\\n\\n The following day, cans began falling on Chicago. St. Louis was next,\\n and then over the entire nation the cans began to rain down. They fell\\n outdoors and indoors, usually materializing at heights that were not\\n dangerous. The deluge followed no pattern. Sometimes it would slacken,\\n sometimes it would stop, sometimes begin heavily again. It fell in\\n homes, on the streets, in theatres, trains, ships, universities and\\n dog-food factories. No place was immune.\\n\\n\\n People took to wearing hats indoors and out, and the sale of helmets\\n boomed.\\n\\n\\n All activity was seriously curtailed.\\n\\n\\n A state of national emergency was declared.\\n\\n\\n Government investigators went to work and soon confirmed what was\\n generally suspected: these were the same cans that had been opened by\\n the Piltdon Super-Opener.\\n\\n\\n Statisticians and mathematicians calculated the mean rate of can\\n precipitation and estimated that if all the cans opened by Piltdon\\n openers were to come back, the deluge should be over in fifteen point\\n twenty-nine days.\\n\\n\\n Super-Opener sales of course immediately plummeted to zero and stayed\\n there. Anti-Piltdon editorials appeared in the papers. Commentators\\n accused Piltdon of deliberately hoaxing the public for his own gain. A\\n Congressional investigation was demanded. Piltdon received threats of\\n bodily injury. Lawsuits were filed against him. He barricaded himself\\n in the plant, surrounded by bodyguards.\\n\\n\\n Livid with fury and apprehension, he screamed at Feetch, \"This is your\\n doing, you vandal! I\\'m a ruined man!\" A falling can caught him neatly\\n on the tip of his nose.\\n\\n\\n \"But sir,\" trembled Feetch, dodging three spaghetti cans, \"I tried to\\n warn you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re through, Feetch!\" raved Piltdon. \"Fired! Get out! But before\\n you go, I want you to know that I\\'ve directed the blame where it\\n belongs. I\\'ve just released to the press the truth about who created\\n the Super-Opener. Now, get out!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Feetch paling. \"Then you don\\'t want to hear about my\\n discovery of a way to prevent the cans from coming back?\"\\n\\n\\n Klunk! A barrage of cans hit the floor, and both men took refuge under\\n Piltdon\\'s huge desk. \"No!\" yelled Piltdon at Feetch\\'s face which was\\n inches away. \"No, I——What did you say?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A small design improvement sir, and the cans would disappear forever.\"\\n\\n\\n Klunk!\\n\\n\\n \"Forever, Feetch?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" Klunk! Klunk!\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re positive, Feetch?\" Piltdon\\'s eyes glared into Feetch\\'s.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir, I never make careless claims.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s true,\" said Piltdon. His eyes grew dreamy. \"It can be done,\"\\n he mused. \"The New Type Super-Opener. Free exchanges for the old.\\n Cash guarantee that empty cans will never bother you. Take a licking\\n at first, but then monopolize the market. All right, Feetch, I\\'ll\\n give you another chance. You\\'ll turn over all the details to me. The\\n patent on the improvement will naturally be mine. I\\'ll get the credit\\n for rectifying your blunder. Fine, fine. We\\'ll work it out. Hop on\\n production, at once, Feetch.\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch felt himself sag inwardly. \"Mr. Piltdon,\" he said. \"I\\'m asking\\n only one favor. Let me work full time on research and development,\\n especially on the Piltdon effect. Hire a couple of extra men to help\\n with production. I assure you the company will benefit in the end.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damn it, no!\" roared Piltdon. \"How many times must I tell you? You got\\n your job back, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n The prospect of long years of heavy production schedules, restricted\\n engineering and tight supervision suddenly made Kalvin Feetch feel\\n very tired. Research, he thought. Development. What he had always\\n wanted. Over the years he had waited, thinking that there would be\\n opportunities later. But now he was growing older, and he felt that\\n there might not be a later. Somehow he would manage to get along.\\n Perhaps someone would give him a job working in the new field he had\\n pioneered. With a sense of relief he realized that he had made his\\n decision.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Piltdon,\" Feetch said. \"I—\" klunk!—\"resign.\"\\n\\n\\n Piltdon started, extreme astonishment crossing his face.\\n\\n\\n \"No use,\" said Feetch. \"Nothing you can say—\" klunk! klunk!\\n klunk!—\"will make any difference now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But see here, the New Type Super-Opener...!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will remain my secret. Good day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Feetch!\" howled Piltdon. \"I order you to remain!\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch almost submitted from force of habit. He hesitated for a moment,\\n then turned abruptly.\\n\\n\\n \"Good-day,\" said Feetch firmly, sprinting through the falling cans to\\n the door.\\nMoney, Feetch decided after a while, was a good thing to have. His\\n supply was running pretty low. He was not having any luck finding\\n another job. Although the cans had stopped falling on the fifteenth\\n day, as predicted by the statisticians, industry would not soon forget\\n the inconvenience and losses caused by the deluge. It was not anxious\\n to hire the man it regarded as responsible for the whole thing.\\n \"Feetch,\" the personnel man would read. \"Kalvin Feetch.\" Then, looking\\n up, \"Not the Kalvin Feetch who—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Feetch would admit miserably.\\n\\n\\n \"I am sorry, but—\"\\n\\n\\n He did no better with research organizations. Typical was a letter\\n from the Van Terrel Foundation: \"—cannot accept your application\\n inasmuch as we feel your premature application of your discovery to\\n profit-making denotes a lack of scientific responsibility and ethics\\n not desirable in a member of our organization—former employer states\\n the decision was yours entirely. Unfavorable reference—\"\\n\\n\\n Piltdon, Feetch thought, feeling a strange sensation deep within his\\n chest that he had not the experience to recognize as the beginning of a\\n slow anger, Piltdon was hitting low and getting away with it.\\n\\n\\n Of course, if he were to agree to reveal his latest discoveries to a\\n research organization, he would undoubtedly get an appointment. But how\\n could he? Everything patentable in his work would automatically revert\\n to Piltdon under the one year clause in the company patent agreement.\\n No, Feetch told himself, he was revealing nothing that Piltdon might\\n grab. The anger began to mount.\\n\\n\\n But he was beginning to need money desperately. Jenny wasn\\'t getting\\n any better and medical bills were running high.\\n\\n\\n The phone rang. Feetch seized it and said to the image: \"Absolutely\\n not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll go up another ten dollars,\" grated the little Piltdon image.\\n \"Do you realize, man, this is the fourteenth raise I\\'ve offered you?\\n A total increase of one hundred and twenty-six dollars? Be sensible,\\n Feetch. I know you can\\'t find work anywhere else.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks to you. Mr. Piltdon, I wouldn\\'t work for you if—\"\\n\\n\\n A barrage of rocks crashed against the heavy steel screening of the\\n window. \"What\\'s going on!\" yelled Piltdon. \"Oh, I see. People throwing\\n rocks at your house again? Oh, I know all about that, Feetch. I know\\n that you\\'re probably the most unpopular man alive to-day. I know about\\n the rocks, the tomatoes, the rotten eggs, the sneaking out at night,\\n the disguises you\\'ve had to use. Why don\\'t you come back to us and\\n change all that, Feetch? We\\'ll put out the New Type Super-Opener and\\n the world will soon forget about the old one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Feetch. \"People will forget anyway—I hope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you won\\'t think of yourself, at least think of your fellow\\n workmen,\" begged Piltdon, his voice going blurry. \"Do you realize that\\n Piltdon Opener will soon be forced to close down, throwing all your\\n former associates out of work? Think of Hanson, Sanchez, Forbes. They\\n have families too. Think of the men in the shop, the girls in the\\n office, the salesmen on the road. All, all unemployed because of you.\\n Think of that, Feetch.\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch blinked. This had not occurred to him.\\n\\n\\n Piltdon eyed him sharply, then smiled with a hint of triumph. \"Think it\\n over, Feetch.\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch sat, thinking it over. Was it right to let all these people lose\\n their jobs? Frowning, he dialed Hanson\\'s number.\\n\\n\\n \"Chief,\" said Hanson, \"Forget it. The boys are behind you one hundred\\n per cent. We\\'ll make out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But that\\'s the trouble. I thought you\\'d feel like this, and I can\\'t\\n let you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re beginning to weaken. Don\\'t. Think, chief, think. The brain that\\n figured the Super-Opener can solve this.\"\\n\\n\\n Feetch hung up. A glow of anger that had been building up in his chest\\n grew warmer. He began pacing the floor. How he hated to do it. Think,\\n Hanson had said. But he had. He\\'s considered every angle, and there was\\n no solution.\\n\\n\\n Feetch walked into the kitchen and carefully poured himself a drink of\\n water. He drank the water slowly and placed the glass on the washstand\\n with a tiny click. It was the tiny click that did it. Something about\\n it touched off the growing rage. If Piltdon were there he would have\\n punched him in the nose. The twenty-five years. The tricks. The threats.\\n\\n\\n Think? He\\'d figured the solution long ago, only he hadn\\'t allowed\\n himself to see it. Not lack of brains, lack of guts. Well, he thought\\n grimly, dialing Piltdon\\'s number, he was going through with it now.\\n \"Piltdon!\" he barked. \"Three p.m. tomorrow. My place. Be here. That\\'s\\n all.\" He hung up.\\n\\n\\n In the same grim mood the following morning, he placed a few more calls.\\nIn the same mood that afternoon he stood in the middle of his\\n living-room and looked at his visitors: Piltdon, Williams, the\\n Government man; Billings from the Van Terrel Foundation; Steiner of\\n Westchester University; the members of the press.\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I\\'ll make it brief.\" He waved the papers in his\\n hand. \"Here is everything I know about what I call the Feetch Effect,\\n including plans and specifications for the New Type Super-Opener.\\n All of you have special reasons for being keenly interested in this\\n information. I am now going to give a copy to each of you, providing\\n one condition is met by Mr. Piltdon.\" He stared at Piltdon. \"In short,\\n I want fifty-one per cent of the stock of Piltdon Opener.\"\\n\\n\\n Piltdon leaped from his chair. \"Outrageous!\" He roared. \"Ridiculous!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fifty-one percent,\" said Feetch firmly. \"Don\\'t bother with any\\n counterproposals or the interview is at an end.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen!\" squawked Piltdon, \"I appeal to you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stop bluffing,\" said Feetch coldly. \"There\\'s no other way out for\\n you. Otherwise you\\'re ruined. Here, sign this agreement.\"\\n\\n\\n Piltdon threw the paper to the floor and screamed: \"Gentlemen, will you\\n be a party to this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" murmured the Government man, \"I never did think Feetch got a\\n fair shake.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This information is important to science,\" said the Van Terrel man.\\n\\n\\n After Piltdon had signed, the papers were distributed.\\n\\n\\n Published in the newspapers the following day, Feetch\\'s statement read,\\n in part: \"The motion in space and time of the singular curvilinear\\n proportions of the original Super-Opener combined with the capacitor\\n effect built up as it increased its frictional electro-static charge\\n in inverse proportion to the cube root of the tolerance between the\\n involute teeth caused an instantaneous disruption of what I call the\\n Alpha multi-dimensional screen. The can, being metallic, dropped\\n through, leaving its non-metallic contents behind. The disruption was\\n instantly repaired by the stable nature of the screen.\\n\\n\\n \"Beyond the screen is what I call Alpha space, a space apparently quite\\n as extensive as our own universe. Unfortunately, as my investigations\\n indicated, Alpha space seems to be thickly inhabited. These\\n inhabitants, the nature of whom I have not yet ascertained, obviously\\n resented the intrusion of the cans, developed a method of disrupting\\n the screen from their side, and hurled the cans back at us.\\n\\n\\n \"However, I have established the existence of other spaces up to Mu\\n space, and suspect that others exist beyond that. Beta space, which is\\n also adjacent to our own space, is devoid of any form of life. The New\\n Type Super-Opener is designed to pass cans through the Beta screen.\\n Beta space will safely absorb an infinite number of cans.\\n\\n\\n \"I sincerely and humbly venture the opinion that we are on the\\n threshold of tremendous and mighty discoveries. It is my belief that\\n possibly an infinite number of universes exist in a type of laminated\\n block separated by screens.\\n\\n\\n \"Therefore, might it not be that an infinite number of laminated blocks\\n exist—?\"\\n\"Mr Feetch—\" said Piltdon.\\n\\n\\n Feetch looked up from his desk in the newly constructed Feetch\\n Multi-Dimensional Development Division of the Piltdon Opener Company.\\n \"Piltdon, don\\'t bother me about production. Production is your problem.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Mr. Feetch—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get out,\" said Feetch.\\n\\n\\n Piltdon blanched and left.\\n\\n\\n \"As I was saying, Hanson—\" continued Feetch.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But now, on\\n\\n Mercury, he was selling his guns into the\\n\\n weirdest of all his exploits—gambling his life\\n\\n against the soft touch of a woman\\'s lips.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Summer 1945.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nOn the stage of\\nMercury Sam\\'s Garden\\n, a tight-frocked, limber-hipped,\\n red-head was singing \"\\nThe Lady from Mars\\n.\" The song was a rollicking,\\n ribald ditty, a favorite of the planters and miners, the space pilots\\n and army officers who frequented the garden. The girl rendered it with\\n such gusto that the audience burst into a roar of applause.\\n\\n\\n She bent her head in acknowledgment so that her bronze red hair fell\\n down about her face. There was perspiration on her upper lip and\\n temples. Her crimson mouth wore a fixed smile. Her eyes were frightened.\\n\\n\\n The man, who had accompanied the singer on the piano, sat at the foot\\n of the stage, his back to the crowded tables. He did not look up at\\n the singer but kept his pale, immature face bent over the keys, while\\n his fingers lightly, automatically picked out the tune. Sweat trickled\\n down the back of his neck, plastered his white coat to his back.\\n Without looking up, he said: \"Have you spotted him?\" His voice was\\n pitched to reach the singer alone.\\n\\n\\n The girl, with an almost imperceptible gesture, shook her head.\\n\\n\\n The night was very hot; but then it is always hot on Mercury, the\\n newest, the wildest, the hottest of Earth\\'s frontiers. Fans spaced\\n about the garden\\'s walls sluggishly stirred the night air, while the\\n men and women sitting at the tables drank heavily of Latonka, the\\n pale green wine of Mercury. Only the native waiters, the enigmatic,\\n yellow-eyed Mercurians, seemed unaffected by the heat. They didn\\'t\\n sweat at all.\\n\\n\\n Up on the stage the singer was about to begin another number when she\\n stiffened.\\n\\n\\n \"Here he is,\" she said to the pianist without moving her lips.\\n\\n\\n The pianist swung around on his stool, lifted his black eyes to the\\n gate leading to the street.\\n\\n\\n Just within the entrance, a tall, thin man was standing. He looked like\\n a gaunt gray wolf loitering in the doorway. His white duraloes suit\\n hung faultlessly. His black hair was close-cropped, his nose thin and\\n aquiline. For a moment he studied the crowded garden before making his\\n way to a vacant table.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on,\" said the pianist in a flat voice.\\n\\n\\n The red-head shivered. Stepping from the stage she picked her way\\n through the tables until she came to the one occupied by the newcomer.\\n\\n\\n \"May I join you?\" she asked in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n The man arose. \"Of course. I was expecting you. Here, sit down.\" He\\n pulled out a chair, motioned for the waiter. The Mercurian, his yellow\\n incurious eyes like two round topazes, sidled up. \"Bring us a bottle\\n of Latonka from the Veederman region, well iced.\" The waiter slipped\\n away.\\n\\n\\n \"So,\" said the red-head; \"you have come. I did not think you would be\\n in time.\" Her hands were clenched in her lap. The knuckles were white.\\n\\n\\n The man said nothing.\\n\\n\\n \"I did not want to call you in, Jaro Moynahan.\" It was the first time\\n she had used his name. \"You have the reputation of being unpredictable.\\n I don\\'t trust you, but since....\"\\nShe stopped as the waiter placed glasses on the table and deftly poured\\n the pale green wine. The man, Jaro Moynahan, raised his glass.\\n\\n\\n \"Here\\'s to the revolution,\" he said. His low voice carried an odd,\\n compelling note. His eyes, light blue and amused, were pale against his\\n brown face.\\n\\n\\n The girl drew in her breath.\\n\\n\\n \"No! Mercury is not ready for freedom. Only a handful of fanatics are\\n engineering the revolution. The real Mercurian patriots are against\\n it, but they are afraid to protest. You\\'ve got to believe me. The\\n revolution is scheduled to break during the Festival of the Rains. If\\n it does, the Terrestrials here will be massacred. The Mercurians hate\\n them. We haven\\'t but a handful of troops.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan wiped the sweat from his forehead with a fine duraweb\\n handkerchief. \"I had forgotten how abominably hot it can be here.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl ignored the interruption. \"There is one man; he is the leader,\\n the very soul of the revolution. The Mercurians worship him. They will\\n do whatever he says. Without him they would be lost. He is the rebel,\\n Karfial Hodes. I am to offer you ten thousand Earth notes to kill\\n Karfial Hodes.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan refilled their empty glasses. He was a big man, handsome\\n in a gaunt fashion. Only his eyes were different. They were flat and\\n a trifle oblique with straight brows. The pupils were a pale and\\n penetrating blue that could probe like a surgeon\\'s knife. Now he caught\\n the girl\\'s eyes and held them with his own as a man spears a fish.\\n\\n\\n \"Why call me all the way from Mars for that? Why not have that gunman\\n at the piano rub Hodes out?\"\\n\\n\\n The girl started, glanced at the pianist, said with a shiver: \"We can\\'t\\n locate Karfial Hodes. Don\\'t look at me that way, Jaro. You frighten me.\\n I\\'m telling the truth. We can\\'t find him. That\\'s why we called you.\\n You\\'ve got to find him, Jaro. He\\'s stirring up all Mercury.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s putting up the money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t tell you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Jaro Moynahan; \"so that\\'s the way it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the way it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There isn\\'t much time,\" he said after a moment. \"The Rains are due any\\n day now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" the girl replied. \"But we think he\\'s here in the city.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why? What makes you think that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He was seen,\" she began, then stopped with a gasp.\\n\\n\\n The lights had gone out.\\n\\n\\n It was as unexpected as a shot in the back. One moment the garden was\\n glowing in light, the next the hot black night swooped down on the\\n revelers, pressing against their eyes like dark wool. The fans about\\n the walls slowed audibly and stopped. It grew hotter, closer.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan slipped sideways from the table. He felt something brush\\n his sleeve. Somewhere a girl giggled.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s coming off here?\" growled a petulant male voice. Other voices\\n took up the plaint.\\n\\n\\n Across the table from Jaro there was the feel of movement; he could\\n sense it. An exclamation was suddenly choked off as if a hand had been\\n clamped over the girl\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\\n \"Red!\" said Jaro in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n There was no answer.\\n\\n\\n \"Red!\" he repeated, louder.\\n\\n\\n Unexpectedly, the deep, ringing voice of Mercury Sam boomed out from\\n the stage.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s all right. The master fuse blew out. The lights will be on in a\\n moment.\"\\n\\n\\n On the heels of his speech the lights flashed on, driving the night\\n upward. The fans recommenced their monotonous whirring.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan glanced at the table. The red-headed singer was gone. So\\n was the pianist.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan sat quietly back down and poured himself another glass of\\n Latonka. The pale green wine had a delicate yet exhilarating taste.\\n It made him think of cool green grapes beaded with dew. On the hot,\\n teeming planet of Mercury it was as refreshing as a cold plunge.\\n\\n\\n He wondered who was putting up the ten thousand Earth notes? Who stood\\n to lose most in case of a revolution? The answer seemed obvious enough.\\n Who, but Albert Peet. Peet controlled the Latonka trade for which there\\n was a tremendous demand throughout the Universe.\\n\\n\\n And what had happened to the girl. Had the rebels abducted her. If\\n so, he suspected that they had caught a tartar. The Red Witch had the\\n reputation of being able to take care of herself.\\n\\n\\n He beckoned a waiter, paid his bill. As the Mercurian started to leave,\\n a thought struck Jaro. These yellow-eyed Mercurians could see as well\\n in the dark as any alley-prowling cat. For centuries they had lived\\n most their lives beneath ground to escape the terrible rays of the\\n sun. Only at night did they emerge to work their fields and ply their\\n trades. He peeled off a bill, put it in the waiter\\'s hands.\\n\\n\\n \"What became of the red-headed singer?\"\\n\\n\\n The Mercurian glanced at the bill, then back at the Earthman. There was\\n no expression in his yellow eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"She and the man, the queer white one who plays the piano, slipped out\\n the gate to the street.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro shrugged, dismissed the waiter. He had not expected to get much\\n information from the waiter, but he was not a man to overlook any\\n possibility. If the girl had been abducted, only Mercurians could have\\n engineered it in the dark; and the Mercurians were a clannish lot.\\n\\n\\n Back on the narrow alley-like street Jaro Moynahan headed for his\\n hostelry. By stretching out his arms he could touch the buildings on\\n either side: buildings with walls four feet thick to keep out the\\n heat of the sun. Beneath his feet, he knew, stretched a labyrinth of\\n rooms and passages. Somewhere in those rat-runs was Karfial Hodes, the\\n revolutionist, and the girl.\\n\\n\\n At infrequent intervals green globes cut a hole in the night, casting a\\n faint illumination. He had just passed one of these futile street lamps\\n when he thought he detected a footfall behind him. It was only the\\n whisper of a sound, but as he passed beyond the circle of radiation, he\\n flattened himself in a doorway. Nothing stirred. There was no further\\n sound. Again he started forward, but now he was conscious of shadows\\n following him. They were never visible, but to his trained ears there\\n came stealthy, revealing noises: the brush of cloth against the baked\\n earth walls, the sly shuffle of a step. He ducked down a bisecting\\n alley, faded into a doorway. Immediately all sounds of pursuit stopped.\\n But as soon as he emerged he was conscious again of the followers. In\\n the dense, humid night, he was like a blind man trying to elude the\\n cat-eyed Mercurians.\\nJaro Moynahan\\nIn the East a sullen red glow stained the heavens like the reflection\\n of a fire. The Mercurian dawn was about to break. With an oath, he set\\n out again for his hostelry. He made no further effort to elude the\\n followers.\\nOnce back in his room, Jaro Moynahan stripped off his clothes,\\n unbuckled a shoulder holster containing a compressed air slug gun,\\n stepped under the shower. His body was lean and brown as his face\\n and marked with innumerable scars. There were small round puckered\\n scars and long thin ones, and his left shoulder bore the unmistakable\\n brownish patch of a ray burn. Stepping out of the shower, he dried,\\n rebuckled on the shoulder holster, slipped into pajamas. The pajamas\\n were blue with wide gaudy stripes. Next he lit a cigarette and\\n stretching out on the bed began to contemplate his toes with singular\\n interest.\\n\\n\\n He had, he supposed, killed rather a lot of men. He had fought in\\n the deadly little wars of the Moons of Jupiter for years, then the\\n Universal Debacle of 3368, after that the Martian Revolution as well as\\n dozens of skirmishes between the Federated Venusian States. No, there\\n was little doubt but that he had killed quite a number of men. But this\\n business of hunting a man through the rat-runs beneath the city was out\\n of his line.\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, there was something phony about the entire set up.\\n The Mercurians, he knew, had been agitating for freedom for years.\\n Why, at this time when the Earth Congress was about to grant them\\n self-government, should they stage a revolution?\\n\\n\\n A loud, authoritative rapping at the door interrupted further\\n speculation. He swung his bare feet over the edge of the bed, stood\\n up and ground out his cigarette. Before he could reach the door the\\n rapping came again.\\n\\n\\n Throwing off the latch, he stepped back, balancing on the balls of his\\n feet.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in,\" he called.\\n\\n\\n The door swung open. A heavy set man entered, shut and locked the door,\\n then glanced around casually. His eyes fastened on Jaro. He licked his\\n lips.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Moynahan, the—ah—professional soldier, I believe.\" His voice was\\n high, almost feminine. \"I\\'m Albert Peet.\" He held out a fat pink hand.\\n\\n\\n Jaro said nothing. He ignored the hand, waited, poised like a cat.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet licked his lips again. \"I have come, Mr. Moynahan, on a matter\\n of business, urgent business. I had not intended to appear in this\\n matter. I preferred to remain behind the scenes, but the disappearance\\n of Miss Mikail has—ah—forced my hand.\" He paused.\\n\\n\\n Jaro still said nothing. Miss Mikail must be the red-headed singer,\\n whom at different times he had known under a dozen different aliases.\\n He doubted that even she remembered her right name.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Mikail made you a proposition?\" Albert Peet\\'s voice was tight.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Jaro.\\n\\n\\n \"You accepted?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, no. As it happened she was abducted before I had the chance.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet licked his lips. \"But you will, surely you will. Unless\\n Karfial Hodes is stopped immediately there will be a bloody uprising\\n all over the planet during the Festival of the Rains. Earth doesn\\'t\\n realize the seriousness of the situation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then I was right; it is you who are putting up the ten thousand Earth\\n notes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not entirely,\" said Peet uncomfortably. \"There are many of us\\n here, Mercurians as well as Earthmen, who recognize the danger. We\\n have—ah—pooled our resources.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you stand to lose most in case of a successful revolution?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps. I have a large interest in the Latonka trade. It\\n is—ah—lucrative.\"\\nJaro Moynahan lit a cigarette, sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Why\\n beat about the bush,\" he asked with a sudden grin. \"Mr. Peet, you\\'ve\\n gained control of the Latonka trade. Other Earthmen are in control\\n of the mines and the northern plantations. Together you form perhaps\\n the strongest combine the Universe has ever seen. You actually run\\n Mercury, and you\\'ve squeezed out every possible penny. Every time\\n self-government has come before the Earth Congress you\\'ve succeeded in\\n blocking it. You are, perhaps, the most cordially-hated group anywhere.\\n I don\\'t wonder that you are afraid of a revolution.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead. \"Fifteen\\n thousand Earth notes I can offer you. But no more. That is as high as I\\n can go.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro laughed. \"How did you know Red had been kidnapped?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We have a very efficient information system. I had the report of Miss\\n Mikail\\'s abduction fifteen minutes after the fact.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro raised his eyebrows. \"Perhaps then you know where she is?\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet shook his head. \"No. Karfial Hodes\\' men abducted her.\"\\n\\n\\n A second rapping at the door caused them to exchange glances. Jaro went\\n to the door, opened it. The pianist at the gardens was framed in the\\n entrance. His black eyes burned holes in his pale boyish face. His\\n white suit was blotched with sweat and dirt.\\n\\n\\n \"They told me Mr. Peet was here,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s for you,\" said Jaro over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet came to the door. \"Hello, Stanley. I thought Hodes had you?\\n Where\\'s Miss Mikail?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got away. Look, Mr. Peet, I got to see you alone.\"\\n\\n\\n Albert Peet said, \"Would you excuse me, Mr. Moynahan?\" He licked his\\n lips. \"I\\'ll just step out into the hall a moment.\" He went out, drawing\\n the door shut after him.\\n\\n\\n Jaro lit a cigarette. He padded nervously back and forth across the\\n room, his bare feet making no noise. He sat down on the edge of the\\n bed. He got up and ground out the cigarette. He went to the door, but\\n did not open it. Instead, he took another turn about the room. Again he\\n came to a halt before the door, pressed his ear against the panel. For\\n a long time he listened but could distinguish no murmur of voices. With\\n an oath he threw open the door. The hall was empty.\\nII\\n\\n\\n Jaro returned to his room, stripped off his pajamas, climbed back into\\n his suit. He tested the slug gun. It was a flat, ugly weapon which\\n hurled a slug the size of a quarter. He preferred it because, though he\\n seldom shot to kill, it stopped a man like a well placed mule\\'s hoof.\\n He adjusted the gun lightly in its holster in order that it wouldn\\'t\\n stick if he were called upon to use it in a hurry. Then he went out\\n into the hall.\\n\\n\\n At the desk he inquired if any messages had come for him. There were\\n none, but the clerk had seen Mr. Peet with a young fellow take the\\n incline to the underground. Above the clerk\\'s head a newsograph was\\n reeling off the current events almost as soon as they happened. Jaro\\n read:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nEarth Congress suspends negotiations on Mercurian freedom pending\\n investigation of rumored rebellion. Terrestrials advised to return to\\n Earth. Karfial Hodes, Mercurian patriot, being sought.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro descended the incline to the network of burrows which served\\n as streets during the flaming days. Here in the basements and\\n sub-basements were located the shops and dram houses where the\\n Mercurians sat around little tables drinking silently of the pale green\\n Latonka. The burrows were but poorly lit, the natives preferring the\\n cool gloom, and Jaro had to feel his way, rubbing shoulders with the\\n strange, silent populace. But when he reached the Terrestrial quarter\\n of the city, bright radoxide lights took the place of the green globes,\\n and there was a sprinkling of Colonial guards among the throng.\\n\\n\\n Jaro halted before a door bearing a placard which read:\\n\\n\\n \"LATONKA TRUST\"\\n\\n\\n He pushed through the door into a rich carpeted reception room. At the\\n far end was a second door beside which sat a desk, door and desk being\\n railed off from the rest of the office. The door into Albert Peet\\'s\\n inner sanctum was ajar. Jaro could distinguish voices; then quite\\n clearly he heard Albert Peet say in a high girlish tone:\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley, I thought I left you in the native quarter. Why did you\\n follow me? How many times have I told you never to come here?\"\\n\\n\\n The reply was unintelligible. Then the pale-faced young man came\\n through the door shutting it after himself. At the sight of Jaro\\n Moynahan he froze.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'re you sneaking around here for?\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro settled himself warily, his light blue eyes flicking over the\\n youth.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get this straight,\" he said mildly. \"I\\'ve known your kind\\n before. Frankly, ever since I saw you I\\'ve had to repress a desire to\\n step on you as I might a spider.\"\\n\\n\\n The youth\\'s black eyes were hot as coals, his fingers twitching. His\\n hands began to creep upward.\\n\\n\\n \"You dirty ...\" he began, but he got no further. Jaro Moynahan shot him\\n in the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n The compressed air slug gun had seemed to leap into Jaro\\'s hand. The\\n big slug, smacked the gunman\\'s shoulder with a resounding thwack,\\n hurled him against the wall. Jaro vaulted the rail, deftly relieved him\\n of two poisoned needle guns.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll get you for this,\" said Stanley, his mouth twisted in pain.\\n \"You\\'ve broken my shoulder. I\\'ll kill you.\"\\n\\n\\n The door to the inner sanctum swung open.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s happened?\" cried Albert Peet in distress. \"What\\'s wrong with\\n you, Stanley?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This dirty slob shot me in the shoulder.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But how badly?\" Peet was wringing his hands.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing serious,\" said Jaro. \"He\\'ll have his arm in a sling for a\\n while. That\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley,\" said Mr. Peet. \"You\\'re bleeding all over my carpet. Why\\n can\\'t you go in the washroom. There\\'s a tile floor in there. If you\\n hadn\\'t disobeyed this wouldn\\'t have happened. You and your fights. Has\\n anyone called a doctor? Where\\'s Miss Webb? Miss Webb! Oh, Miss Webb!\\n That girl. Miss Webb!\"\\nStanley climbed to his feet, swayed a moment drunkenly, then wobbled\\n out a door on the left just as a tall brunette hurried in from the\\n right. She had straight black hair which hung not quite to her\\n shoulders, and dark brown eyes, and enough of everything else to absorb\\n Jaro\\'s attention.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh!\" exclaimed Miss Webb as she caught sight of the blood staining the\\n carpet.\\nJoan Webb\\n\"There\\'s been an—ah—accident,\" said Mr. Peet, and he licked his lips.\\n \"Call a doctor, Miss Webb.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb raised an eyebrow, went to the visoscreen. In a moment she\\n had tuned in the prim starched figure of a nurse seated at a desk.\\n\\n\\n \"Could Dr. Baer rush right over here? There\\'s been an accident.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Rush over where?\" said the girl in the visoscreen. \"These gadgets\\n aren\\'t telepathic, honey.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Miss Webb, \"the offices of the Latonka Trust.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl in the visoscreen thawed like ice cream in the sun. \"I\\'m sure\\n Dr. Baer can come. He\\'ll be there in a moment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Miss Webb. She flicked the machine off, then added:\\n \"You trollop.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet regarded Jaro Moynahan with distress.\\n\\n\\n \"Really, Mr. Moynahan, was it necessary to shoot Stanley? Isn\\'t\\n that—ah—a little extreme? I\\'m afraid it might incapacitate him, and I\\n had a job for him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" cried Miss Webb, her brown eyes crackling. \"Did you shoot that\\n poor boy? Aren\\'t you the big brave man?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Poor boy?\" said Jaro mildly. \"Venomous little rattlesnake. I took\\n these toys away from him.\" He held out the poisoned dart guns. \"You\\n take them, Mr. Peet. Frankly, they give me the creeps. They might go\\n off. A scratch from one of those needles would be enough.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet accepted the guns gingerly. He held them as if they might\\n explode any minute. He started to put them in his pocket, thought\\n better of it, glanced around helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \"Here, Miss Webb,\" he said, \"do something with these. Put them in my\\n desk.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb\\'s eyes grew round as marbles. \"I wouldn\\'t touch one of those\\n nasty little contraptions for all the Latonka on Mercury.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Here, I\\'ll take them,\" said Stanley coming back into the room. He had\\n staunched the flow of blood. His face was even whiter, if possible.\\n Jaro eyed him coldly as with his good hand the youth dropped the dart\\n guns back into their holsters.\\n\\n\\n \"Act like you want to use those and I\\'ll put a slug in your head next\\n time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, Mr. Moynahan.\" Mr. Peet licked his lips nervously. \"Stanley, go\\n into my office. The doctor will be here in a moment. Miss Webb, you may\\n go home. I\\'ll have no more work for you today.\"\\nAlbert Peet led Stanley through the door. Jaro and Miss Webb were\\n alone. With his eye on the door, Jaro said:\\n\\n\\n \"When you go out, turn left toward the native quarter. Wait for me in\\n the first grog shop you come to.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb raised her eyebrows. \"What\\'s this? A new technique?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look,\" began Jaro annoyed.\\n\\n\\n \"My eyes are practically popping out of my head now,\" she interrupted.\\n \"Another morning like this and I take the first space liner back to\\n Earth.\" She jammed her hat on backward, snatched her bag from the desk\\n drawer.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not trying to pick you up. This is....\"\\n\\n\\n \"How disappointing.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro began again patiently. \"Wait for me in the first grog shop.\\n There\\'s something I must know. It\\'s important.\" He cleared his throat.\\n \"Don\\'t you find the heat rather uncomfortable, Miss Webb. But perhaps\\n you\\'ve become accustomed to it.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet came back into the room.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, no, I mean yes,\" replied Miss Webb, a blank expression in her\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Goodbye, Miss Webb,\" said Mr. Peet firmly.\\n\\n\\n Jaro grinned and winked at her. Miss Webb tottered out of the room.\\n\\n\\n As the door closed behind the girl, Albert Peet licked his lips, said:\\n \"Mr. Moynahan, I suppose my disappearance back at your room requires\\n some explanation. But the fact is that Stanley brought an important bit\\n of news.\" He paused.\\n\\n\\n Jaro said nothing.\\n\\n\\n \"You might be interested to know that Miss Mikail is quite safe.\\n Karfial Hodes has her, but Stanley assures me she will be quite safe.\"\\n Again he paused. As Jaro remained silent, his neck mottled up pinkly.\\n\\n\\n \"The fact is, Mr. Moynahan, that we won\\'t need you after all. I realize\\n that we\\'ve put you to considerable trouble and we\\'re prepared to pay\\n you whatever you believe your time is worth. Say five hundred Earth\\n notes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s fair enough,\" replied Jaro.\\n\\n\\n Albert Peet sighed. \"I have the check made out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Only,\" continued Jaro coldly, \"I\\'m not ready to be bought off. I think\\n I\\'ll deal myself a hand in this game.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet\\'s face fell. \"You won\\'t reconsider?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" said Jaro; \"but I\\'ve got a date. I\\'m late now.\" He started to\\n leave.\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley!\" called Albert Peet.\\n\\n\\n The pale-faced young man appeared in the doorway, the dart gun in his\\n good hand. Jaro Moynahan dropped on his face, jerking out his slug gun\\n as he fell. There was a tiny plop like a cap exploding. He heard the\\n whisper of the poisoned dart as it passed overhead. Then he fired from\\n the floor. The pale-faced young man crumpled like an empty sack.\\n\\n\\n Jaro got up, keeping an eye on Albert Peet, brushed off his knees.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve killed him,\" said Peet. \"If I were you, Mr. Moynahan, I would\\n be on the next liner back to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n Without answering, Jaro backed watchfully from the room.\\nOnce Jaro Moynahan had regained the street, he mopped his forehead with\\n his handkerchief. Whatever was going on, these boys played for keeps.\\n Warily he started down the passage toward the native quarter. At the\\n first basement grog shop he turned in. His eyes swept the chamber, then\\n he grinned.\\n\\n\\n At a corner table, a tall glass of Latonka before her, sat Miss Webb.\\n Her hat was still on backwards, and she was perched on the edge of her\\n chair as if ready to spring up and away like a startled faun.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nBang!\\n\" said Jaro coming up behind her and poking a long brown finger\\n in the small of her back.\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb uttered a shriek, jerked so violently that her hat tilted\\n over one eye. She regarded him balefully from beneath the brim.\\n\\n\\n \"Never a dull moment,\" she gritted.\\n\\n\\n Still grinning, Jaro sat down. \"I\\'m Jaro Moynahan, Miss Webb. I think\\n Albert Peet forgot to introduce us. There\\'s some skullduggery going on\\n here that I\\'m particularly anxious to get to the bottom of. I thought\\n you might be able to help me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Miss Webb sweetly.\\n\\n\\n A native waiter, attracted no doubt by her scream, came over and took\\n Jaro\\'s order.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Jaro smiled, but his pale blue eyes probed the girl\\n thoughtfully. \"I\\'ll have to confide certain facts which might be\\n dangerous for you to know. Are you game, Miss Webb?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Since we\\'re going to be so chummy,\" she replied; \"you might begin by\\n calling me Joan. You make me feel downright ancient.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well then,\" he said. \"In the first place, I just killed that\\n baby-faced gunman your boss had in his office.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAwk!\\n\" said Joan, choking on the Latonka.\\n\\n\\n \"It was self-defense,\" he hastened to assure her. \"He took a pot shot\\n at me with that poisoned dart gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the police!\" she cried, as she caught her breath.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'ll never be an investigation. Albert Peet will see to that. I\\n was called here on what I supposed was a legitimate revolution. Instead\\n I was offered ten thousand Earth notes to assassinate the leader of the\\n revolution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What revolution? I\\'m going around in circles.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Mercurians, of course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t believe it,\" said the girl. \"The Mercurians are the most\\n peaceable people in the Universe. They\\'ve been agitating for freedom,\\n yes. But they believe in passive resistance. I don\\'t believe you could\\n induce a Mercurian to kill, even in self-protection. That\\'s why Albert\\n Peet and the rest of the combine had such an easy time gaining control\\n of the Latonka trade.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Score one,\" breathed Jaro, \"I begin to see light. Miss Webb—ah,\\n Joan—I\\'ve a notion that we\\'re going to be a great team. How do you\\n happen to be Albert Peet\\'s private secretary?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A gal\\'s gotta eat. But the truth is, I was quitting. The Latonka Trust\\n is almost on the rocks. Their stock has been dropping like a meteor.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan raised his oblique brows but did not interrupt.\\n\\n\\n \"Albert Peet,\" she continued, \"has been trying to sell out but nobody\\n will touch the stock, not since it looks as if the Earth Congress is\\n going to grant the Mercurians their freedom. Everybody knows that the\\n first thing the Mercurians will do, will be to boot out the Latonka\\n Trust.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about this Karfial Hodes?\" said Jaro. \"I\\'ve heard that he\\'s\\n inciting the Mercurians to rebellion. The newscaster had a line about\\n the revolution too. The government has advised all Terrestrials to\\n return to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not true,\" Joan flared. \"It\\'s all a pack of lies invented by the\\n Latonka Trust. I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I should think rumors like that would run down the Latonka stock.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

She seemed to\\n be restless to end her fool\\'s errand here, two hundred light years from\\n the waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\\n through her hallways.\\n\\n\\n Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\\n a big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\\n had pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\\n reddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\\n were rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\\n control room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\\n\\n\\n Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\\n moved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\\n need a shave.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\\n hand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\\n during the night?\"\\n\\n\\n \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\\n north of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\\n clouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\\n knew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\\n an almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\\n our two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\\n in the murk. I\\'ve kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\\n\\n\\n Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn\\'t turn out enough starmen\\n in the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\\n as cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he\\'d drawn, Kaufman and\\n Pinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\\n\\n\\n Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn\\'t\\n seemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\\n and harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\\n their internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\\n on their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\\n\\n\\n But\\nsomething\\nhad happened to the exploration party fifteen years\\n back, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\\n up.\\nHe turned to the port to stare out at the planet. The Sol-type sun\\n must be rising, since there was a dim light. But the thick clouds that\\n wrapped the entire world diffused its rays into a haze. For a change,\\n it wasn\\'t raining, though the ground was covered by thick swirls of\\n fog. In the distance, the tops of shrubs that made a scrub forest\\n glowed yellow-green. Motions around them suggested a herd of feeding\\n animals. Details were impossible to see through the haze. Even the\\n deep gorge where they\\'d found Hennessy\\'s carefully buried ship was\\n completely hidden by the fog.\\n\\n\\n There were three of the blobs dancing about over the grazing animals\\n now, as they often seemed to do. Gwayne stared at them for a minute,\\n trying to read sense into the things. If he had time to study them....\\n\\n\\n But there was no time.\\n\\n\\n Earth had ordered him to detour here, after leaving his load of\\n deep-sleep stored colonists on Official World 71, to check on any sign\\n of Hennessy. He\\'d been here a week longer than he should have stayed\\n already. If there was no sign in another day or so of what had happened\\n to the men who\\'d deserted their ship and its equipment, he\\'d have to\\n report back.\\n\\n\\n He would have left before, if a recent landslip hadn\\'t exposed enough\\n of the buried ship for his metal locators to spot from the air by\\n luck. It had obviously been hidden deep enough to foil the detectors\\n originally.\\n\\n\\n \"Bob!\" Jane Corey\\'s voice cut through his pondering. \"Bob, there are\\n the kids!\"\\n\\n\\n Before he could swing to follow her pointing finger, movement caught\\n his eye.\\n\\n\\n The blobs had left the herd. Now the three were streaking at fantastic\\n speed to a spot near the ship, to hover excitedly above something that\\n moved there.\\n\\n\\n He saw the two cadets then, heading back to the waiting ship, just\\n beyond the movement he\\'d seen through the mist.\\n\\n\\n Whatever was making the fog swirl must have reached higher ground.\\n Something began to heave upwards. It was too far to see clearly, but\\n Gwayne grabbed the microphone, yelling into the radio toward the cadets.\\n\\n\\n They must have seen whatever it was just as the call reached them.\\n Young Kaufman grabbed at Pinelli, and they swung around together.\\n\\n\\n Then the mists cleared.\\n\\n\\n Under the dancing blobs, a horde of things was heading for the cadets.\\n Shaggy heads, brute bodies vaguely man-like! One seemed to be almost\\n eight feet tall, leading the others directly toward the spacesuited\\n cadets. Some of the horde were carrying spears or sticks. There was a\\n momentary halt, and then the leader lifted one arm, as if motioning the\\n others forward.\\n\"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of\\n the little officers\\' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was\\n agonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\\n back at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\\n confusion. But someone was taking over now—one of the crew women. The\\n jeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\\n Gwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\\n\\n\\n There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\\n irritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\\n the seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\\n jeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\\n up speed. The other two followed.\\n\\n\\n There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\\n surrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\\n horrible in a travesty of manhood.\\n\\n\\n The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\\n racing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\\n about, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\\n miles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\\n spite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\\n downward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\\n\\n\\n \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he\\'d been a fool to\\n leave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\\n kids. But it was too late to go back.\\n\\n\\n The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\\n a gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\\n had to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\\n\\n\\n Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\\n trail to confuse the pursuers.\\n\\n\\n There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\\n glimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\\n faces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\\n windshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\\n steering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\\n\\n\\n The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\\n other jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\\n to help. They\\'d have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\\n the horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\\n\\n\\n A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\\n\\n\\n He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\\n seemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly, Barker\\'s foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\\n against the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\\n leader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\\n shoulder.\\n\\n\\n The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\\n leaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\\n for the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.\\nThe arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distorted\\n shoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\\n hands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\\n nose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\\n the captain\\'s attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\\n sound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\\n further move, though it was still breathing.\\n\\n\\n Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\\n was either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\\n kick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\\n onto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\\n on another before heading back.\\n\\n\\n \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\\n his own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster\\'s landing.\\n\\n\\n \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live—and you\\'re\\n detailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\\n language or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\\n and why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\\n answer.\"\\n\\n\\n Barker nodded grimly. \"I\\'ll try, though I can\\'t risk drugs on an alien\\n metabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he\\'d dug out, then spat\\n sickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\\n makes no sense. We\\'ve scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\\n no sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\\n anything. I\\'ve got to get this ship back to Earth. We\\'re overstaying\\n our time here already.\"\\n\\n\\n The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They\\'d been\\n picked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\\n busy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\\n as he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\\n informative with retelling.\\n\\n\\n If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\\n time and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy\\'s ship. That\\n was almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\\n to be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy\\'s rescue group had\\n been overcome by the aliens.\\n\\n\\n It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\\n primitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy\\'s ship? Why was its\\n fuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\\n these creatures that a space ship\\'s metal finders could be fooled by a\\n little more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They\\'d buried the ship\\n cunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\\n\\n\\n Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\\n something—and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\\n remotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.\\nThe race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\\n into a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\\n prevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\\n a drive that led to the stars, and hadn\\'t even found intelligent life\\n there to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\\n\\n\\n But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\\n finally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\\n\\n\\n It wouldn\\'t be much of an explosion, as such things go—but it would\\n render the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\\n man had to colonize.\\n\\n\\n And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\\n explorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\\n terraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\\n began filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\\n space.\\n\\n\\n Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\\n four more months back.\\n\\n\\n In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\\n footholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some\\n of the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none\\n would be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was\\n precious as a haven for the race.\\n\\n\\n If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as\\n it now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\\n\\n\\n Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\\n strip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\\n\\n\\n But how could primitives do what these must have done?\\n\\n\\n He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\\n cemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\\n laminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\\n hand had been able to do for centuries.\\n\\n\\n \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\n Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\\n see a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\\n\\n\\n He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\\n squatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\\n They were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\\n For the return of their leader—or for something that would give the\\n ship to them?\\n\\n\\n Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How\\'s the captive coming?\"\\n\\n\\n Barker\\'s voice sounded odd.\\n\\n\\n \"Physically fine. You can see him. But—\"\\n\\n\\n Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\\n at Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\\n checking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\\n\\n\\n There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\\n sound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne\\'s neck. Barker\\n seemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\\n\\n\\n The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\\n thick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\\n some kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\\n unerringly toward the device on the officer\\'s cap.\\n\\n\\n \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said.\\n\"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\\n Barker said. There was a grin on the doctor\\'s lips, but his face was\\n taut with strain.\\n\\n\\n The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\\n its head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\\n\\n\\n \"He never meant to hurt the kids—just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\\n quickly. \"I\\'ve got some of the story. He\\'s changed. He can\\'t talk very\\n well. Says they\\'ve had to change the language around to make the sounds\\n fit, and he\\'s forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\\n gets easier as you listen. It\\'s Hennessy, all right. I\\'m certain.\"\\n\\n\\n Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\\n on the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\\n English, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\\n\\n\\n \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\\n kid\\'s dog have? How many were brown?\"\\n\\n\\n The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\\n curiously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\\n spread out.\\n\\n\\n Three. Seven. Zero.\\n\\n\\n The answers were right.\\n\\n\\n By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\\n twisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\\n long time telling.\\n\\n\\n When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\\n silence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\\n possible, Doc?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\\n by what I know. But it happened. I\\'ve looked at a few tissues under\\n the microscope. The changes are there. It\\'s hard to believe about\\n their kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can\\'t be\\n a hereditary change—the things that affect the body don\\'t change the\\n germ plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\\n the fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\\n\\n\\n Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\\n down to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\\n monsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\\n tall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\\n\\n\\n The kids of the exploring party....\\nBack in the control room, Gwayne found the emergency release levers,\\n set the combinations and pressed the studs. There was a hiss and gurgle\\n as the great tanks of fuel discharged their contents out onto the\\n ground where no ingenuity could ever recover it to bring life to the\\n ship again.\\n\\n\\n He\\'d have to tell the men and women of the crew later, after he\\'d had\\n time to organize things and present it all in a way they could accept,\\n however much they might hate it at first. But there was no putting off\\n giving the gist of it to Jane.\\n\\n\\n \"It was the blobs,\" he summarized it. \"They seem to be amused by men.\\n They don\\'t require anything from us, but they like us around. Hennessy\\n doesn\\'t know why. They can change our cells, adapt us. Before men came,\\n all life here had twelve legs. Now they\\'re changing that, as we\\'ve seen.\\n\\n\\n \"And they don\\'t have to be close to do it. We\\'ve all been outside the\\n hull. It doesn\\'t show yet—but we\\'re changed. In another month, Earth\\n food would kill us. We\\'ve got to stay here. We\\'ll bury the ships deeper\\n this time, and Earth won\\'t find us. They can\\'t risk trying a colony\\n where three ships vanish, so we\\'ll just disappear. And they\\'ll never\\n know.\"\\n\\n\\n Nobody would know. Their children—odd children who matured in eight\\n years—would be primitive savages in three generations. The Earth\\n tools would be useless, impossible for the hands so radically changed.\\n Nothing from the ship would last. Books could never be read by the new\\n eyes. And in time, Earth wouldn\\'t even be a memory to this world.\\n\\n\\n She was silent a long time, staring out of the port toward what must\\n now be her home. Then she sighed. \"You\\'ll need practice, but the others\\n don\\'t know you as well as I do, Bob. I guess we can fix it so they\\'ll\\n believe it all. And it\\'s too late now. But we haven\\'t really been\\n changed yet, have we?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" he admitted. Damn his voice! He\\'d never been good at lying. \"No.\\n They have to touch us. I\\'ve been touched, but the rest could go back.\"\\n\\n\\n She nodded. He waited for the condemnation, but there was only\\n puzzlement in her face. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n And then, before he could answer, her own intelligence gave her the\\n same answer he had found for himself. \"The spawning ground!\"\\n\\n\\n It was the only thing they could do. Earth needed a place to plant her\\n seed, but no world other than Earth could ever be trusted to preserve\\n that seed for generation after generation. Some worlds already were\\n becoming uncertain.\\n\\n\\n Here, though, the blobs had adapted men to the alien world instead of\\n men having to adapt the whole planet to their needs. Here, the strange\\n children of man\\'s race could grow, develop and begin the long trek back\\n to civilization. The gadgets would be lost for a time. But perhaps\\n some of the attitudes of civilized man would remain to make the next\\n rise to culture a better one.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re needed here,\" he told her, his voice pleading for the\\n understanding he couldn\\'t yet fully give himself. \"These people need\\n as rich a set of bloodlines as possible to give the new race strength.\\n The fifty men and women on this ship will be needed to start them with\\n a decent chance. We can\\'t go to Earth, where nobody would believe or\\n accept the idea—or even let us come back. We have to stay here.\"\\n\\n\\n She smiled then and moved toward him, groping for his strength. \"Be\\n fruitful,\" she whispered. \"Be fruitful and spawn and replenish an\\n earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" he told her. \"Replenish the stars.\"\\n\\n\\n But she was no longer listening, and that part of his idea could wait.\\n\\n\\n Some day, though, their children would find a way to the starlanes\\n again, looking for other worlds. With the blobs to help them, they\\n could adapt to most worlds. The unchanged spirit would lead them\\n through all space, and the changing bodies would claim worlds beyond\\n numbering.\\n\\n\\n Some day, the whole universe would be a spawning ground for the\\n children of men!\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The girl rendered it with\\n such gusto that the audience burst into a roar of applause.\\n\\n\\n She bent her head in acknowledgment so that her bronze red hair fell\\n down about her face. There was perspiration on her upper lip and\\n temples. Her crimson mouth wore a fixed smile. Her eyes were frightened.\\n\\n\\n The man, who had accompanied the singer on the piano, sat at the foot\\n of the stage, his back to the crowded tables. He did not look up at\\n the singer but kept his pale, immature face bent over the keys, while\\n his fingers lightly, automatically picked out the tune. Sweat trickled\\n down the back of his neck, plastered his white coat to his back.\\n Without looking up, he said: \"Have you spotted him?\" His voice was\\n pitched to reach the singer alone.\\n\\n\\n The girl, with an almost imperceptible gesture, shook her head.\\n\\n\\n The night was very hot; but then it is always hot on Mercury, the\\n newest, the wildest, the hottest of Earth\\'s frontiers. Fans spaced\\n about the garden\\'s walls sluggishly stirred the night air, while the\\n men and women sitting at the tables drank heavily of Latonka, the\\n pale green wine of Mercury. Only the native waiters, the enigmatic,\\n yellow-eyed Mercurians, seemed unaffected by the heat. They didn\\'t\\n sweat at all.\\n\\n\\n Up on the stage the singer was about to begin another number when she\\n stiffened.\\n\\n\\n \"Here he is,\" she said to the pianist without moving her lips.\\n\\n\\n The pianist swung around on his stool, lifted his black eyes to the\\n gate leading to the street.\\n\\n\\n Just within the entrance, a tall, thin man was standing. He looked like\\n a gaunt gray wolf loitering in the doorway. His white duraloes suit\\n hung faultlessly. His black hair was close-cropped, his nose thin and\\n aquiline. For a moment he studied the crowded garden before making his\\n way to a vacant table.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on,\" said the pianist in a flat voice.\\n\\n\\n The red-head shivered. Stepping from the stage she picked her way\\n through the tables until she came to the one occupied by the newcomer.\\n\\n\\n \"May I join you?\" she asked in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n The man arose. \"Of course. I was expecting you. Here, sit down.\" He\\n pulled out a chair, motioned for the waiter. The Mercurian, his yellow\\n incurious eyes like two round topazes, sidled up. \"Bring us a bottle\\n of Latonka from the Veederman region, well iced.\" The waiter slipped\\n away.\\n\\n\\n \"So,\" said the red-head; \"you have come. I did not think you would be\\n in time.\" Her hands were clenched in her lap. The knuckles were white.\\n\\n\\n The man said nothing.\\n\\n\\n \"I did not want to call you in, Jaro Moynahan.\" It was the first time\\n she had used his name. \"You have the reputation of being unpredictable.\\n I don\\'t trust you, but since....\"\\nShe stopped as the waiter placed glasses on the table and deftly poured\\n the pale green wine. The man, Jaro Moynahan, raised his glass.\\n\\n\\n \"Here\\'s to the revolution,\" he said. His low voice carried an odd,\\n compelling note. His eyes, light blue and amused, were pale against his\\n brown face.\\n\\n\\n The girl drew in her breath.\\n\\n\\n \"No! Mercury is not ready for freedom. Only a handful of fanatics are\\n engineering the revolution. The real Mercurian patriots are against\\n it, but they are afraid to protest. You\\'ve got to believe me. The\\n revolution is scheduled to break during the Festival of the Rains. If\\n it does, the Terrestrials here will be massacred. The Mercurians hate\\n them. We haven\\'t but a handful of troops.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan wiped the sweat from his forehead with a fine duraweb\\n handkerchief. \"I had forgotten how abominably hot it can be here.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl ignored the interruption. \"There is one man; he is the leader,\\n the very soul of the revolution. The Mercurians worship him. They will\\n do whatever he says. Without him they would be lost. He is the rebel,\\n Karfial Hodes. I am to offer you ten thousand Earth notes to kill\\n Karfial Hodes.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan refilled their empty glasses. He was a big man, handsome\\n in a gaunt fashion. Only his eyes were different. They were flat and\\n a trifle oblique with straight brows. The pupils were a pale and\\n penetrating blue that could probe like a surgeon\\'s knife. Now he caught\\n the girl\\'s eyes and held them with his own as a man spears a fish.\\n\\n\\n \"Why call me all the way from Mars for that? Why not have that gunman\\n at the piano rub Hodes out?\"\\n\\n\\n The girl started, glanced at the pianist, said with a shiver: \"We can\\'t\\n locate Karfial Hodes. Don\\'t look at me that way, Jaro. You frighten me.\\n I\\'m telling the truth. We can\\'t find him. That\\'s why we called you.\\n You\\'ve got to find him, Jaro. He\\'s stirring up all Mercury.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s putting up the money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t tell you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Jaro Moynahan; \"so that\\'s the way it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the way it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There isn\\'t much time,\" he said after a moment. \"The Rains are due any\\n day now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" the girl replied. \"But we think he\\'s here in the city.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why? What makes you think that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He was seen,\" she began, then stopped with a gasp.\\n\\n\\n The lights had gone out.\\n\\n\\n It was as unexpected as a shot in the back. One moment the garden was\\n glowing in light, the next the hot black night swooped down on the\\n revelers, pressing against their eyes like dark wool. The fans about\\n the walls slowed audibly and stopped. It grew hotter, closer.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan slipped sideways from the table. He felt something brush\\n his sleeve. Somewhere a girl giggled.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s coming off here?\" growled a petulant male voice. Other voices\\n took up the plaint.\\n\\n\\n Across the table from Jaro there was the feel of movement; he could\\n sense it. An exclamation was suddenly choked off as if a hand had been\\n clamped over the girl\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\\n \"Red!\" said Jaro in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n There was no answer.\\n\\n\\n \"Red!\" he repeated, louder.\\n\\n\\n Unexpectedly, the deep, ringing voice of Mercury Sam boomed out from\\n the stage.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s all right. The master fuse blew out. The lights will be on in a\\n moment.\"\\n\\n\\n On the heels of his speech the lights flashed on, driving the night\\n upward. The fans recommenced their monotonous whirring.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan glanced at the table. The red-headed singer was gone. So\\n was the pianist.\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan sat quietly back down and poured himself another glass of\\n Latonka. The pale green wine had a delicate yet exhilarating taste.\\n It made him think of cool green grapes beaded with dew. On the hot,\\n teeming planet of Mercury it was as refreshing as a cold plunge.\\n\\n\\n He wondered who was putting up the ten thousand Earth notes? Who stood\\n to lose most in case of a revolution? The answer seemed obvious enough.\\n Who, but Albert Peet. Peet controlled the Latonka trade for which there\\n was a tremendous demand throughout the Universe.\\n\\n\\n And what had happened to the girl. Had the rebels abducted her. If\\n so, he suspected that they had caught a tartar. The Red Witch had the\\n reputation of being able to take care of herself.\\n\\n\\n He beckoned a waiter, paid his bill. As the Mercurian started to leave,\\n a thought struck Jaro. These yellow-eyed Mercurians could see as well\\n in the dark as any alley-prowling cat. For centuries they had lived\\n most their lives beneath ground to escape the terrible rays of the\\n sun. Only at night did they emerge to work their fields and ply their\\n trades. He peeled off a bill, put it in the waiter\\'s hands.\\n\\n\\n \"What became of the red-headed singer?\"\\n\\n\\n The Mercurian glanced at the bill, then back at the Earthman. There was\\n no expression in his yellow eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"She and the man, the queer white one who plays the piano, slipped out\\n the gate to the street.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro shrugged, dismissed the waiter. He had not expected to get much\\n information from the waiter, but he was not a man to overlook any\\n possibility. If the girl had been abducted, only Mercurians could have\\n engineered it in the dark; and the Mercurians were a clannish lot.\\n\\n\\n Back on the narrow alley-like street Jaro Moynahan headed for his\\n hostelry. By stretching out his arms he could touch the buildings on\\n either side: buildings with walls four feet thick to keep out the\\n heat of the sun. Beneath his feet, he knew, stretched a labyrinth of\\n rooms and passages. Somewhere in those rat-runs was Karfial Hodes, the\\n revolutionist, and the girl.\\n\\n\\n At infrequent intervals green globes cut a hole in the night, casting a\\n faint illumination. He had just passed one of these futile street lamps\\n when he thought he detected a footfall behind him. It was only the\\n whisper of a sound, but as he passed beyond the circle of radiation, he\\n flattened himself in a doorway. Nothing stirred. There was no further\\n sound. Again he started forward, but now he was conscious of shadows\\n following him. They were never visible, but to his trained ears there\\n came stealthy, revealing noises: the brush of cloth against the baked\\n earth walls, the sly shuffle of a step. He ducked down a bisecting\\n alley, faded into a doorway. Immediately all sounds of pursuit stopped.\\n But as soon as he emerged he was conscious again of the followers. In\\n the dense, humid night, he was like a blind man trying to elude the\\n cat-eyed Mercurians.\\nJaro Moynahan\\nIn the East a sullen red glow stained the heavens like the reflection\\n of a fire. The Mercurian dawn was about to break. With an oath, he set\\n out again for his hostelry. He made no further effort to elude the\\n followers.\\nOnce back in his room, Jaro Moynahan stripped off his clothes,\\n unbuckled a shoulder holster containing a compressed air slug gun,\\n stepped under the shower. His body was lean and brown as his face\\n and marked with innumerable scars. There were small round puckered\\n scars and long thin ones, and his left shoulder bore the unmistakable\\n brownish patch of a ray burn. Stepping out of the shower, he dried,\\n rebuckled on the shoulder holster, slipped into pajamas. The pajamas\\n were blue with wide gaudy stripes. Next he lit a cigarette and\\n stretching out on the bed began to contemplate his toes with singular\\n interest.\\n\\n\\n He had, he supposed, killed rather a lot of men. He had fought in\\n the deadly little wars of the Moons of Jupiter for years, then the\\n Universal Debacle of 3368, after that the Martian Revolution as well as\\n dozens of skirmishes between the Federated Venusian States. No, there\\n was little doubt but that he had killed quite a number of men. But this\\n business of hunting a man through the rat-runs beneath the city was out\\n of his line.\\n\\n\\n Furthermore, there was something phony about the entire set up.\\n The Mercurians, he knew, had been agitating for freedom for years.\\n Why, at this time when the Earth Congress was about to grant them\\n self-government, should they stage a revolution?\\n\\n\\n A loud, authoritative rapping at the door interrupted further\\n speculation. He swung his bare feet over the edge of the bed, stood\\n up and ground out his cigarette. Before he could reach the door the\\n rapping came again.\\n\\n\\n Throwing off the latch, he stepped back, balancing on the balls of his\\n feet.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in,\" he called.\\n\\n\\n The door swung open. A heavy set man entered, shut and locked the door,\\n then glanced around casually. His eyes fastened on Jaro. He licked his\\n lips.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Moynahan, the—ah—professional soldier, I believe.\" His voice was\\n high, almost feminine. \"I\\'m Albert Peet.\" He held out a fat pink hand.\\n\\n\\n Jaro said nothing. He ignored the hand, waited, poised like a cat.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet licked his lips again. \"I have come, Mr. Moynahan, on a matter\\n of business, urgent business. I had not intended to appear in this\\n matter. I preferred to remain behind the scenes, but the disappearance\\n of Miss Mikail has—ah—forced my hand.\" He paused.\\n\\n\\n Jaro still said nothing. Miss Mikail must be the red-headed singer,\\n whom at different times he had known under a dozen different aliases.\\n He doubted that even she remembered her right name.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Mikail made you a proposition?\" Albert Peet\\'s voice was tight.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Jaro.\\n\\n\\n \"You accepted?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, no. As it happened she was abducted before I had the chance.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet licked his lips. \"But you will, surely you will. Unless\\n Karfial Hodes is stopped immediately there will be a bloody uprising\\n all over the planet during the Festival of the Rains. Earth doesn\\'t\\n realize the seriousness of the situation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then I was right; it is you who are putting up the ten thousand Earth\\n notes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not entirely,\" said Peet uncomfortably. \"There are many of us\\n here, Mercurians as well as Earthmen, who recognize the danger. We\\n have—ah—pooled our resources.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you stand to lose most in case of a successful revolution?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps. I have a large interest in the Latonka trade. It\\n is—ah—lucrative.\"\\nJaro Moynahan lit a cigarette, sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Why\\n beat about the bush,\" he asked with a sudden grin. \"Mr. Peet, you\\'ve\\n gained control of the Latonka trade. Other Earthmen are in control\\n of the mines and the northern plantations. Together you form perhaps\\n the strongest combine the Universe has ever seen. You actually run\\n Mercury, and you\\'ve squeezed out every possible penny. Every time\\n self-government has come before the Earth Congress you\\'ve succeeded in\\n blocking it. You are, perhaps, the most cordially-hated group anywhere.\\n I don\\'t wonder that you are afraid of a revolution.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead. \"Fifteen\\n thousand Earth notes I can offer you. But no more. That is as high as I\\n can go.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro laughed. \"How did you know Red had been kidnapped?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We have a very efficient information system. I had the report of Miss\\n Mikail\\'s abduction fifteen minutes after the fact.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro raised his eyebrows. \"Perhaps then you know where she is?\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet shook his head. \"No. Karfial Hodes\\' men abducted her.\"\\n\\n\\n A second rapping at the door caused them to exchange glances. Jaro went\\n to the door, opened it. The pianist at the gardens was framed in the\\n entrance. His black eyes burned holes in his pale boyish face. His\\n white suit was blotched with sweat and dirt.\\n\\n\\n \"They told me Mr. Peet was here,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s for you,\" said Jaro over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet came to the door. \"Hello, Stanley. I thought Hodes had you?\\n Where\\'s Miss Mikail?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got away. Look, Mr. Peet, I got to see you alone.\"\\n\\n\\n Albert Peet said, \"Would you excuse me, Mr. Moynahan?\" He licked his\\n lips. \"I\\'ll just step out into the hall a moment.\" He went out, drawing\\n the door shut after him.\\n\\n\\n Jaro lit a cigarette. He padded nervously back and forth across the\\n room, his bare feet making no noise. He sat down on the edge of the\\n bed. He got up and ground out the cigarette. He went to the door, but\\n did not open it. Instead, he took another turn about the room. Again he\\n came to a halt before the door, pressed his ear against the panel. For\\n a long time he listened but could distinguish no murmur of voices. With\\n an oath he threw open the door. The hall was empty.\\nII\\n\\n\\n Jaro returned to his room, stripped off his pajamas, climbed back into\\n his suit. He tested the slug gun. It was a flat, ugly weapon which\\n hurled a slug the size of a quarter. He preferred it because, though he\\n seldom shot to kill, it stopped a man like a well placed mule\\'s hoof.\\n He adjusted the gun lightly in its holster in order that it wouldn\\'t\\n stick if he were called upon to use it in a hurry. Then he went out\\n into the hall.\\n\\n\\n At the desk he inquired if any messages had come for him. There were\\n none, but the clerk had seen Mr. Peet with a young fellow take the\\n incline to the underground. Above the clerk\\'s head a newsograph was\\n reeling off the current events almost as soon as they happened. Jaro\\n read:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nEarth Congress suspends negotiations on Mercurian freedom pending\\n investigation of rumored rebellion. Terrestrials advised to return to\\n Earth. Karfial Hodes, Mercurian patriot, being sought.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro descended the incline to the network of burrows which served\\n as streets during the flaming days. Here in the basements and\\n sub-basements were located the shops and dram houses where the\\n Mercurians sat around little tables drinking silently of the pale green\\n Latonka. The burrows were but poorly lit, the natives preferring the\\n cool gloom, and Jaro had to feel his way, rubbing shoulders with the\\n strange, silent populace. But when he reached the Terrestrial quarter\\n of the city, bright radoxide lights took the place of the green globes,\\n and there was a sprinkling of Colonial guards among the throng.\\n\\n\\n Jaro halted before a door bearing a placard which read:\\n\\n\\n \"LATONKA TRUST\"\\n\\n\\n He pushed through the door into a rich carpeted reception room. At the\\n far end was a second door beside which sat a desk, door and desk being\\n railed off from the rest of the office. The door into Albert Peet\\'s\\n inner sanctum was ajar. Jaro could distinguish voices; then quite\\n clearly he heard Albert Peet say in a high girlish tone:\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley, I thought I left you in the native quarter. Why did you\\n follow me? How many times have I told you never to come here?\"\\n\\n\\n The reply was unintelligible. Then the pale-faced young man came\\n through the door shutting it after himself. At the sight of Jaro\\n Moynahan he froze.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'re you sneaking around here for?\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro settled himself warily, his light blue eyes flicking over the\\n youth.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get this straight,\" he said mildly. \"I\\'ve known your kind\\n before. Frankly, ever since I saw you I\\'ve had to repress a desire to\\n step on you as I might a spider.\"\\n\\n\\n The youth\\'s black eyes were hot as coals, his fingers twitching. His\\n hands began to creep upward.\\n\\n\\n \"You dirty ...\" he began, but he got no further. Jaro Moynahan shot him\\n in the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n The compressed air slug gun had seemed to leap into Jaro\\'s hand. The\\n big slug, smacked the gunman\\'s shoulder with a resounding thwack,\\n hurled him against the wall. Jaro vaulted the rail, deftly relieved him\\n of two poisoned needle guns.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll get you for this,\" said Stanley, his mouth twisted in pain.\\n \"You\\'ve broken my shoulder. I\\'ll kill you.\"\\n\\n\\n The door to the inner sanctum swung open.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s happened?\" cried Albert Peet in distress. \"What\\'s wrong with\\n you, Stanley?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This dirty slob shot me in the shoulder.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But how badly?\" Peet was wringing his hands.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing serious,\" said Jaro. \"He\\'ll have his arm in a sling for a\\n while. That\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley,\" said Mr. Peet. \"You\\'re bleeding all over my carpet. Why\\n can\\'t you go in the washroom. There\\'s a tile floor in there. If you\\n hadn\\'t disobeyed this wouldn\\'t have happened. You and your fights. Has\\n anyone called a doctor? Where\\'s Miss Webb? Miss Webb! Oh, Miss Webb!\\n That girl. Miss Webb!\"\\nStanley climbed to his feet, swayed a moment drunkenly, then wobbled\\n out a door on the left just as a tall brunette hurried in from the\\n right. She had straight black hair which hung not quite to her\\n shoulders, and dark brown eyes, and enough of everything else to absorb\\n Jaro\\'s attention.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh!\" exclaimed Miss Webb as she caught sight of the blood staining the\\n carpet.\\nJoan Webb\\n\"There\\'s been an—ah—accident,\" said Mr. Peet, and he licked his lips.\\n \"Call a doctor, Miss Webb.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb raised an eyebrow, went to the visoscreen. In a moment she\\n had tuned in the prim starched figure of a nurse seated at a desk.\\n\\n\\n \"Could Dr. Baer rush right over here? There\\'s been an accident.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Rush over where?\" said the girl in the visoscreen. \"These gadgets\\n aren\\'t telepathic, honey.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Miss Webb, \"the offices of the Latonka Trust.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl in the visoscreen thawed like ice cream in the sun. \"I\\'m sure\\n Dr. Baer can come. He\\'ll be there in a moment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Miss Webb. She flicked the machine off, then added:\\n \"You trollop.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet regarded Jaro Moynahan with distress.\\n\\n\\n \"Really, Mr. Moynahan, was it necessary to shoot Stanley? Isn\\'t\\n that—ah—a little extreme? I\\'m afraid it might incapacitate him, and I\\n had a job for him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" cried Miss Webb, her brown eyes crackling. \"Did you shoot that\\n poor boy? Aren\\'t you the big brave man?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Poor boy?\" said Jaro mildly. \"Venomous little rattlesnake. I took\\n these toys away from him.\" He held out the poisoned dart guns. \"You\\n take them, Mr. Peet. Frankly, they give me the creeps. They might go\\n off. A scratch from one of those needles would be enough.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet accepted the guns gingerly. He held them as if they might\\n explode any minute. He started to put them in his pocket, thought\\n better of it, glanced around helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \"Here, Miss Webb,\" he said, \"do something with these. Put them in my\\n desk.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb\\'s eyes grew round as marbles. \"I wouldn\\'t touch one of those\\n nasty little contraptions for all the Latonka on Mercury.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Here, I\\'ll take them,\" said Stanley coming back into the room. He had\\n staunched the flow of blood. His face was even whiter, if possible.\\n Jaro eyed him coldly as with his good hand the youth dropped the dart\\n guns back into their holsters.\\n\\n\\n \"Act like you want to use those and I\\'ll put a slug in your head next\\n time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, Mr. Moynahan.\" Mr. Peet licked his lips nervously. \"Stanley, go\\n into my office. The doctor will be here in a moment. Miss Webb, you may\\n go home. I\\'ll have no more work for you today.\"\\nAlbert Peet led Stanley through the door. Jaro and Miss Webb were\\n alone. With his eye on the door, Jaro said:\\n\\n\\n \"When you go out, turn left toward the native quarter. Wait for me in\\n the first grog shop you come to.\"\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb raised her eyebrows. \"What\\'s this? A new technique?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look,\" began Jaro annoyed.\\n\\n\\n \"My eyes are practically popping out of my head now,\" she interrupted.\\n \"Another morning like this and I take the first space liner back to\\n Earth.\" She jammed her hat on backward, snatched her bag from the desk\\n drawer.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not trying to pick you up. This is....\"\\n\\n\\n \"How disappointing.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro began again patiently. \"Wait for me in the first grog shop.\\n There\\'s something I must know. It\\'s important.\" He cleared his throat.\\n \"Don\\'t you find the heat rather uncomfortable, Miss Webb. But perhaps\\n you\\'ve become accustomed to it.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet came back into the room.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, no, I mean yes,\" replied Miss Webb, a blank expression in her\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Goodbye, Miss Webb,\" said Mr. Peet firmly.\\n\\n\\n Jaro grinned and winked at her. Miss Webb tottered out of the room.\\n\\n\\n As the door closed behind the girl, Albert Peet licked his lips, said:\\n \"Mr. Moynahan, I suppose my disappearance back at your room requires\\n some explanation. But the fact is that Stanley brought an important bit\\n of news.\" He paused.\\n\\n\\n Jaro said nothing.\\n\\n\\n \"You might be interested to know that Miss Mikail is quite safe.\\n Karfial Hodes has her, but Stanley assures me she will be quite safe.\"\\n Again he paused. As Jaro remained silent, his neck mottled up pinkly.\\n\\n\\n \"The fact is, Mr. Moynahan, that we won\\'t need you after all. I realize\\n that we\\'ve put you to considerable trouble and we\\'re prepared to pay\\n you whatever you believe your time is worth. Say five hundred Earth\\n notes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s fair enough,\" replied Jaro.\\n\\n\\n Albert Peet sighed. \"I have the check made out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Only,\" continued Jaro coldly, \"I\\'m not ready to be bought off. I think\\n I\\'ll deal myself a hand in this game.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Peet\\'s face fell. \"You won\\'t reconsider?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" said Jaro; \"but I\\'ve got a date. I\\'m late now.\" He started to\\n leave.\\n\\n\\n \"Stanley!\" called Albert Peet.\\n\\n\\n The pale-faced young man appeared in the doorway, the dart gun in his\\n good hand. Jaro Moynahan dropped on his face, jerking out his slug gun\\n as he fell. There was a tiny plop like a cap exploding. He heard the\\n whisper of the poisoned dart as it passed overhead. Then he fired from\\n the floor. The pale-faced young man crumpled like an empty sack.\\n\\n\\n Jaro got up, keeping an eye on Albert Peet, brushed off his knees.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve killed him,\" said Peet. \"If I were you, Mr. Moynahan, I would\\n be on the next liner back to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n Without answering, Jaro backed watchfully from the room.\\nOnce Jaro Moynahan had regained the street, he mopped his forehead with\\n his handkerchief. Whatever was going on, these boys played for keeps.\\n Warily he started down the passage toward the native quarter. At the\\n first basement grog shop he turned in. His eyes swept the chamber, then\\n he grinned.\\n\\n\\n At a corner table, a tall glass of Latonka before her, sat Miss Webb.\\n Her hat was still on backwards, and she was perched on the edge of her\\n chair as if ready to spring up and away like a startled faun.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nBang!\\n\" said Jaro coming up behind her and poking a long brown finger\\n in the small of her back.\\n\\n\\n Miss Webb uttered a shriek, jerked so violently that her hat tilted\\n over one eye. She regarded him balefully from beneath the brim.\\n\\n\\n \"Never a dull moment,\" she gritted.\\n\\n\\n Still grinning, Jaro sat down. \"I\\'m Jaro Moynahan, Miss Webb. I think\\n Albert Peet forgot to introduce us. There\\'s some skullduggery going on\\n here that I\\'m particularly anxious to get to the bottom of. I thought\\n you might be able to help me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Miss Webb sweetly.\\n\\n\\n A native waiter, attracted no doubt by her scream, came over and took\\n Jaro\\'s order.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Jaro smiled, but his pale blue eyes probed the girl\\n thoughtfully. \"I\\'ll have to confide certain facts which might be\\n dangerous for you to know. Are you game, Miss Webb?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Since we\\'re going to be so chummy,\" she replied; \"you might begin by\\n calling me Joan. You make me feel downright ancient.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well then,\" he said. \"In the first place, I just killed that\\n baby-faced gunman your boss had in his office.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAwk!\\n\" said Joan, choking on the Latonka.\\n\\n\\n \"It was self-defense,\" he hastened to assure her. \"He took a pot shot\\n at me with that poisoned dart gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the police!\" she cried, as she caught her breath.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'ll never be an investigation. Albert Peet will see to that. I\\n was called here on what I supposed was a legitimate revolution. Instead\\n I was offered ten thousand Earth notes to assassinate the leader of the\\n revolution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What revolution? I\\'m going around in circles.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Mercurians, of course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t believe it,\" said the girl. \"The Mercurians are the most\\n peaceable people in the Universe. They\\'ve been agitating for freedom,\\n yes. But they believe in passive resistance. I don\\'t believe you could\\n induce a Mercurian to kill, even in self-protection. That\\'s why Albert\\n Peet and the rest of the combine had such an easy time gaining control\\n of the Latonka trade.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Score one,\" breathed Jaro, \"I begin to see light. Miss Webb—ah,\\n Joan—I\\'ve a notion that we\\'re going to be a great team. How do you\\n happen to be Albert Peet\\'s private secretary?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A gal\\'s gotta eat. But the truth is, I was quitting. The Latonka Trust\\n is almost on the rocks. Their stock has been dropping like a meteor.\"\\n\\n\\n Jaro Moynahan raised his oblique brows but did not interrupt.\\n\\n\\n \"Albert Peet,\" she continued, \"has been trying to sell out but nobody\\n will touch the stock, not since it looks as if the Earth Congress is\\n going to grant the Mercurians their freedom. Everybody knows that the\\n first thing the Mercurians will do, will be to boot out the Latonka\\n Trust.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about this Karfial Hodes?\" said Jaro. \"I\\'ve heard that he\\'s\\n inciting the Mercurians to rebellion. The newscaster had a line about\\n the revolution too. The government has advised all Terrestrials to\\n return to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not true,\" Joan flared. \"It\\'s all a pack of lies invented by the\\n Latonka Trust. I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I should think rumors like that would run down the Latonka stock.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The First Vice-President\\n \\nwas a cool cat—the elevator and the\\n \\nmoney operators all wore earmuffs—was\\n \\njust as phony as a three-dollar bill!\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nI\\n\\n\\n The First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank and\\n Trust Company, the gentleman to whom Miss Orison McCall was applying\\n for a job, was not at all the public picture of a banker. His suit of\\n hound\\'s-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his\\n jacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious\\n bank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really\\n swing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you\\n come on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from\\n staring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji\\'s costume, a pair of\\n furry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color\\n bread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Beg pardon?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and\\n down on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\\n\\n\\n \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re worth more\\'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\\n \"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught\\n Orison\\'s look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he\\n explained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work\\n in a bank, you gotta know who\\'s picture\\'s on the paper. That\\'s a\\n hunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed.\\n\\n\\n \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison\\'s right hand and shook it with\\n athletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell\\n you, chick, it\\'s none too soon we got some decent scenery around\\n this tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of\\n elevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\\n to Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\\n than Mr. Wanji\\'s, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\\n Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\\n \"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\\n and floor five. Basement and everything higher\\'n fifth floor is Iron\\n Curtain Country far\\'s you\\'re concerned. Dig, baby?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she\\'d be issued earmuffs,\\n now that she\\'d become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\\n\\n\\n The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\\n hold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\\n a microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\\n \"Here\\'s where you\\'ll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\\n\\n\\n \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\\n\\n\\n The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\\n \"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\\n get done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\\n read. Okay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I\\'m a\\n secretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\\n with the Bank\\'s operation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\\n there paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you\\'re here, Mr. Wanji, I\\'d like to\\n ask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\\n coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take\\n care of these details now? Or would you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin\\' kinda stuff any way seems\\n best to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank\\'s\\n might explain why she\\'d been selected from the Treasury Department\\'s\\n secretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,\\n girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket,\\n unfolded it to discover the day\\'s\\nWall Street Journal\\n, and began at\\n the top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,\\n nodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\\n \"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the\\n one into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then\\n took off upstairs in the elevator.\\nBy lunchtime Orison had finished the\\nWall Street Journal\\nand had\\n begun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a\\n fantastic novel of some sort, named\\nThe Hobbit\\n. Reading this peculiar\\n fare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than\\n ever that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her,\\n the front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a\\n Federal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a\\n microphone for an invisible audience.\\n\\n\\n Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the\\n book and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was\\n a new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming\\n down from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with\\n briefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these\\n gentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped\\n aboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his\\n heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment\\n of their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny\\n into this curiousest of banks.\\n\\n\\n Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude.\\n Girls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together,\\n eyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and\\n favored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed,\\n finished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her\\n lonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book,\\n reading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of\\n Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her\\n light coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed,\\n silent, hat-clasping gentlemen.\\n\\n\\n What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a\\n double Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard\\n Taft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of\\n the U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association.\\n Earmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President\\n with the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those\\n upper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment\\n house—the Windsor Arms—and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her\\n boss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft\\n Bank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought.\\n She was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker.\\n\\n\\n Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day\\'s\\n observations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for\\n her initial report. Item: some of the men at the Bank wore earmuffs,\\n several didn\\'t. Item: the Vice-President\\'s name was Mr. Wanji:\\n Oriental? Item: the top eight floors of the Taft Bank Building seemed\\n to be off-limits to all personnel not wearing earmuffs. Item: she was\\n being employed at a very respectable salary to read newsprint and\\n nonsense into a microphone. Let Washington make sense of that, she\\n thought.\\nIn a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\\n o\\'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\\n of her first day\\'s spying.\\n\\n\\n No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\\n was set; the lights were out. Wasn\\'t Washington going to call her?\\n Perhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\\n had her phone tapped.\\n\\n\\n \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\\n\\n\\n Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\\n Do you read me? Over.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\\n she reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\\n\\n\\n The room was empty.\\n\\n\\n \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\\n\\n\\n \"What you\\'re testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\\n Who are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\\n have anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\\n to your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\\n\\n\\n \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\\n beside her.\\n\\n\\n Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\\n asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\\n security. Have you anything to report?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\\n time?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\\n establish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\\n every day?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\\n \"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\\n microphone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\\n National Bank and Trust Company. \"That\\'s about it, so far,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you\\'ve dropped\\n into a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How do you know ... why do you think I\\'m beautiful?\" Orison asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\\n a peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\\n placed the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\\n\\n\\n Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\\n to write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\\n registered mail.\\nII\\n\\n\\n At ten o\\'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\\nWall Street Journal\\n, Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\\n of leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\\n was bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\\n wearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\\n President of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\\n little family.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\\n So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\\n Maybe higher heels?\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\\n the chair to the right of her desk.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\\n\\n\\n \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\\n reasonably astute sixth-grader couldn\\'t do as well,\" Orison said.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\\n as though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\\n designation is Confidential Secretary. It\\'s me whose confidences you\\'re\\n to keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\\n and dictate it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\\n presence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\\n\\n\\n \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\\n asked, as though following her train of thought.\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I\\'ve been associated with a rather large\\n financial organization.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you\\'ll get used\\n to them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I\\'d be most grateful if you\\'d dispense\\n with calling me \\'sir.\\' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I\\'d enjoy\\n your using it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you\\'re to call me Orison?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\\n evening?\"\\n\\n\\n Direct, she thought. Perhaps that\\'s why he\\'s president of a bank, and\\n still so young. \"We\\'ve hardly met,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"But we\\'re on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\\n playing, from the elevator.\\n\\n\\n \"Then I\\'ll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\\n personnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\\n and bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\\n Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\\n curtsy? Orison wondered.\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\\n stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\\n to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\\n saw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mbut\\n not their earmuffs\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\\n Small bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\\nOrison finished the\\nWall Street Journal\\nby early afternoon. A\\n page came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of\\n yesterday\\'s\\nCongressional Record\\n. She launched into the\\nRecord\\n,\\n thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome\\n madman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read\\n so\\nwell\\n, darling,\" someone said across the desk.\\n\\n\\n Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t hear you come up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front\\n of the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison\\n thought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don\\'t like\\n her. Can\\'t. Wouldn\\'t if I could. Never cared for cats.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing\\n teeth.\\n\\n\\n \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I\\'m\\n Auga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Won\\'t you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan\\'t have time to\\n visit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.\\n One for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\\n\\n\\n \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I\\'d like to\\n draw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding—you know, the\\n shoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he\\'s posted property. Should\\n you throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you\\'d only get your little\\n eyes scratched out. Word to the wise,\\nn\\'est-ce pas\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her\\nWall\\n Street Journal\\ninto a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You\\'re all alone up here.\\n You could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of\\n annoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you\\'d best hurry back to\\n your stanchion, Bossy, before the hay\\'s all gone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Isn\\'t it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right\\n off?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator,\\n displaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba\\n motion.\\n\\n\\n The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,\\n stepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\\n\\n\\n \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,\\n he stepped up to Orison\\'s desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused\\n and shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It\\'s just that ...\\n Vingt thing....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank\\n and Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I\\'m Kraft Gerding,\\n Dink\\'s elder brother. I understand you\\'ve met Dink already.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped\\n even closer than Dink\\'s. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch\\n of frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink\\'s, were cobalt blue. The\\n head, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill\\'s\\n spike-topped\\nPickelhauben\\n; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed\\n normal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed—what continental manners these bankers\\n had!—and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up\\n paper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.\\nInstead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and\\n said, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,\\n Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing\\n business with pleasure.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she\\n shouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I\\n care. I\\'m not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in\\n finance, and listen to another word.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,\\n a bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank\\'s most\\n charming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,\\n dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to\\n the wise....\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nN\\'est-ce pas?\\n\" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here\\'s a word to the\\n foolish. Get lost.\"\\n\\n\\n Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind\\n you. Push a button, will you? And\\nbon voyage\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with\\n a cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above\\n fifth floor.\\n\\n\\n First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.\\n Surely, Orison thought, recovering the\\nWall Street Journal\\nfrom her\\n wastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern\\n bank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior\\n of the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\\n thought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\\n and all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\\n finished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\\n upper floors.\\n\\n\\n Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\\n sudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \"\\nWanji e-Kal, Datto.\\n Dink ger-Dink d\\'summa.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before\\n replying, \"I\\'m a local girl. Try me in English.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I\\'m in kinda\\n clutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see\\n him, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I\\'ll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down.\\n What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language\\n Mr. Wanji had used? She\\'d have to report the message to Washington by\\n tonight\\'s pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\\n it out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\\n she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\\n only fire her.\\n\\n\\n Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\\n be here in a moment with something new to read. She\\'d best get going.\\n The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\\n off the upstairs floors.\\n\\n\\n But the building had a stairway.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\\n seven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\\n the landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\\n was a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\\n fringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\\n\\n\\n She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\\n\\n\\n Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\\n extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\\n its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\\n galvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\\n Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\\n and eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\\n strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\\n pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\\n full of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\\n Orison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\\n liquid. Then she screamed.\\nThe pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\\n the spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\\n upon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\\n leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\\n put her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\\n stairway door.\\n\\n\\n Into a pair of arms.\\n\\n\\n \"I had hoped you\\'d be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\\n Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\\n her wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\\n Gerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn\\'t care for spiders,\" he\\n said. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were\\n we to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against\\n her two\\nsumo\\n-sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by\\n some quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the\\n floor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted\\n all around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of\\n course, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of\\n calcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you\\'d be filleted within\\n minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Elder Compassion wouldn\\'t like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of\\n the earmuffed\\nsumo\\n-wrestlers protested.\\n\\n\\n \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you\\n must tell me what you were doing here, or I\\'ll toss you to the spiders.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\\n\\n\\n \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of\\n damsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the\\n bank.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you\\n acromegalic apes!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\"\\nSuddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as\\n though struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their\\n faces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering\\n himself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without\\n questions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms\\n around Orison.\\n\\n\\n \"They can\\'t harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against\\n his chest. \"You\\'re all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn\\n your brain back on. All right, now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said, still trembling. \"They were going to throw me to\\n the spiders.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kraft told you that?\" Dink Gerding released her and turned to the\\n kneeling man. \"Stand up, Elder Brother.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I....\"\\n\\n\\n Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft\\'s\\n jaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'d care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to\\n recover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.\"\\n Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink\\n through half-closed eyes. \"No? Then get out of here, all of you.\\nSamma!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with\\n the merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.\\n\\n\\n \"I wish you hadn\\'t come up here, Orison,\" Dink said. \"Why did you do\\n it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Have you read the story of Bluebeard?\" Orison asked. She stood close\\n to Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see\\n what it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was\\n forbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for\\n you, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you\\n that the escudo green is pale.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what\\n is this thing you have about spiders?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little\\n girl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a\\n spider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came\\n home and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn\\'t have appetite\\n for supper.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked\\n one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider,\\n Orison,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped\\n in the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related\\n to shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They\\'re stone-and-metal\\n eaters. They literally couldn\\'t harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He\\n extended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,\\n flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around\\n the bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn\\'t he?\" Dink asked.\\n \"Here. You hold him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d rather not,\" she protested.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d be happier if you did,\" Dink said.\\nOrison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the\\n Microfabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like\\n a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and\\n unfolded it, to hold it over Orison\\'s palm.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said.\\n\\n\\n \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial\\n process we\\'re developing. That\\'s why we keep this floor closed off and\\n secret. We don\\'t have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do they do?\" Orison asked.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can\\'t tell even you\\n that, not yet, even though you\\'re my most confidential secretary.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus,\\n perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching\\n against her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.\\n\\n\\n \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder,\\n comfortably close. \"They\\'re attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as\\n children are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison.\\n We\\'d better get you down where you belong.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest\\n tank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring.\\n It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange,\\n using crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I\\n thought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something\\n like the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing\\n together while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He\\n took her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you\\'ll find the song these\\n little workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\\n\\n\\n Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink\\'s arms, listening to\\n the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,\\n storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace\\n and harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash\\n of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the\\n quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\\n \"It\\'s an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been\\n singing it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a\\n wood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\\n \"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\\n \"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the\\n mineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the\\n liquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\\n \"They\\'re so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she\\n thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling\\n life. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

His slim mother with nervously\\n polite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailty\\n that he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all,\\n marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out.\\n\\n\\n The old man said, \"He\\'ll be okay. Let him alone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he won\\'t eat. Just lies there all the time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hell,\" the old man said. \"Sixteen\\'s a bad time. School over, waiting\\n for the draft and all. He\\'s in between. It\\'s rough.\"\\n\\n\\n Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly.\\n\\n\\n \"We got to let him go, Eva. It\\'s a dangerous time. You got to remember\\n about all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere to\\n go, like they say. You read the books.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he\\'s unhappy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are we specialists? That\\'s the Youth Board\\'s headache, ain\\'t it? What\\n do we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed or\\n we\\'ll be late.\"\\n\\n\\n Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposeless\\n noises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say.\\n Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in the\\n same old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all the\\n way to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or with\\n eyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retire\\n into limbo.\\n\\n\\n How come he\\'d been stuck with parental images like that? One\\n thing—when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pants\\n off Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he\\'d forget his\\n punkie origins in teeveeland.\\n\\n\\n But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressed\\n impulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was no\\n doubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion.\\n So he\\'d waited in his room, and it wasn\\'t easy sweating it out alone\\n waiting for the breakout call from HQ.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, dear, if you say so,\" Mother said, with the old resigned sigh\\n that must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly.\\n\\n\\n They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up.\\n\\n\\n \"Relax,\" Wayne said. \"You\\'re not going anywhere tonight.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What, son?\" his old man said uneasily. \"Sure we are. We\\'re going to\\n the movies.\"\\n\\n\\n He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn\\'t\\n answer. Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then was\\n silent.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, go,\" Wayne said. \"If you wanta walk. I\\'m taking the family\\n boltbucket.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But we promised the Clemons, dear,\" his mother said.\\n\\n\\n \"Hell,\" Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. \"I just got my\\n draft call.\"\\n\\n\\n He saw the old man\\'s Adam\\'s apple move. \"Oh, my dear boy,\" Mother cried\\n out.\\n\\n\\n \"So gimme the keys,\" Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. His\\n understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he\\n laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed\\n the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp\\n onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling\\n neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed\\n the glaring wonders of escape.\\nHe burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode\\n under a sign reading\\nPublic Youth Center No. 947\\nand walked casually\\n to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant\\'s stripes and a\\n pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\\n\\n\\n \"Where you think you\\'re going, my pretty lad?\"\\n\\n\\n Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a\\n pass, killer?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote\\n on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and\\n check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to\\n Captain Jack, room 307.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\\n\\n\\n A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.\\n Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you\\'re the only kid\\n breaking out tonight?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a\\n cigarette. \"I\\'ve decided.\"\\n\\n\\n The corporal\\'s little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.\\n \"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It\\'s a big city and\\n you\\'re starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes\\n are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still\\n a counterboy. I\\'m impressed. I\\'m all ears, Dad.\"\\n\\n\\n The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head\\n ventilated, bud, and good.\"\\n\\n\\n Wayne\\'s mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the\\n shelves and racks of weapons. \"I\\'ll remember that crack when I get\\n my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal\\'s face. \"Bring me a\\n Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in\\n a Skelly switchblade for kicks—the six-inch disguised job with the\\n double springs.\"\\n\\n\\n The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade\\n disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,\\n while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the\\n cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped\\n the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its\\n gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted\\n incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and\\n scary.\\n\\n\\n He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left\\n armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the\\n way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket\\n back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the\\n elevator and didn\\'t look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with\\n stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain\\n Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had\\n a head shaped like a grinning bear.\\n\\n\\n Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to\\n shrink him. If he didn\\'t watch himself he\\'d begin feeling like a pea\\n among bowling balls.\\n\\n\\n Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy\\n head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\\n\\n\\n \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something\\n in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you\\'re really fired up aren\\'t you?\\n Really going out to eat \\'em. Right, punk?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.\\n His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear\\n the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I\\'ll\\n show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until\\n he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,\\n ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But\\n that wasn\\'t enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,\\n what was he doing holding down a desk?\\n\\n\\n \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly\\n collection.\"\\n\\n\\n The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch\\n from Wayne\\'s nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped\\n a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\\n\\n\\n Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his\\n passcard. \"Curfew\\'s off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make\\n out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West\\n Side. Know where that is, punk?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir, but I\\'ll find it fast.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She\\'ll be wearing yellow\\n slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She\\'s with a hefty\\n psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He\\'s butchered five people.\\n They\\'re both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and\\n they\\'re your key to the stars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\\n\\n\\n \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack.\\nA copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright\\n respectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\\n\\n\\n Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop\\'s\\n quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The\\n Olds roared over the bridge as the night\\'s rain blew away.\\n\\n\\n The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from\\n Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn\\'t of the night or the wind.\\n He turned off into a rat\\'s warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,\\n secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted\\n potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.\\n Wayne\\'s fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath\\n through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with\\n the shadows of mysterious promise.\\n\\n\\n He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously\\n into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as\\n he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling.\\nFOUR ACES CLUB\\nHe parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging\\n the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass\\n filtering through windows painted black.\\n\\n\\n He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of\\n a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked\\n shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub\\n balanced on one end.\\n\\n\\n The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had\\n a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a\\n grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and\\n doom.\\n\\n\\n \"I gotta hide, kid. They\\'re on me.\"\\n\\n\\n Wayne\\'s chest rose and his hands curled.\\n\\n\\n The bum\\'s fingers drew at the air like white talons.\\n\\n\\n \"Help me, kid.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast\\n of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed\\n past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires\\n squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and\\n crouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\\n\\n\\n \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand\\n came up swinging a baseball bat.\\n\\n\\n A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\\n\\n\\n The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The\\n teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air\\n as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\\n\\n\\n Wayne\\'s breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder\\n at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew\\n and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn\\'t stop anything.\\n Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,\\n until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He\\n held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in\\n spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting\\n license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\\n\\n\\n The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener\\n laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell\\n clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth\\n still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled\\n up with stick arms over his rheumy face.\\n\\n\\n The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down\\n with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the\\n Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling\\n glass.\\n\\n\\n \"Go, man!\"\\n\\n\\n The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it\\n bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like\\n bright wind-blown sparks.\\n\\n\\n Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in\\n scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made\\n his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\\n\\n\\n He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and\\n pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires.\\nHe walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and\\n stood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and\\n yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\\n\\n\\n He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.\\n The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red\\n slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for\\n running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near\\n her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\\n\\n\\n She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude\\n of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a\\n weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\\n\\n\\n Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty\\n T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse\\n heavy.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, teener.\"\\n\\n\\n Red nuzzled the mouse\\'s neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and\\n fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She\\n sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\\n\\n\\n Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons\\n imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one\\n side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious\\n cat\\'s.\\n\\n\\n Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at\\n his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated\\n on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright\\n but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little\\n mouse.\\n\\n\\n The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in\\n the pay of the state.\\n\\n\\n \"What else, teener?\"\\n\\n\\n \"One thing. Fade.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\\n\\n\\n Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his\\n veins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\\n\\n\\n He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped\\n fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the\\n air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the\\n white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her\\n throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\\n\\n\\n He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table\\n crashed. Wayne\\'s .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast\\n filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door\\n holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne\\'s grasp and was\\n out the door.\\n\\n\\n Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the\\n cold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted\\n down the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\\n\\n\\n He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and\\n then, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the\\n life-or-death animation of a wild deer.\\n\\n\\n Up and down alleys, a rat\\'s maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.\\n Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,\\n sliding down a brick shute.\\n\\n\\n He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her\\n scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood.\\nShe quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with\\n terror.\\n\\n\\n \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\\n\\n\\n She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall,\\n her arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave\\n a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked.\\n He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated\\n in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling\\n plaster, a whimpering whine.\\n\\n\\n \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\\n\\n\\n She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her,\\n feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a\\n sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse\\'s\\n shadow floated ahead.\\n\\n\\n He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing\\n ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He\\n heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from\\n cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the\\n third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the\\n jagged skylight.\\n\\n\\n Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening\\n to his creeping, implacable footfalls.\\n\\n\\n Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\\n\\n\\n Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In\\n the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like\\n a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior,\\n shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the\\n moon-streaming skylight.\\n\\n\\n She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He\\n snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent\\'s\\n tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten\\n cloth.\\n\"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that, baby?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won\\'t know the\\n difference.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don\\'t want—\" She began to cry. She\\n cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth\\n open.\\n\\n\\n \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn\\'t sound\\n like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\\n\\n\\n \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\\n\\n\\n She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up\\n at him.\\n\\n\\n He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and\\n shuffled away from her.\\n\\n\\n He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and\\n clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t run. Please. Kill me! It\\'ll be someone else if you don\\'t. Oh,\\n God, I\\'m so tired waiting and running!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\\n\\n\\n \"Please.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t, I can\\'t!\"\\n\\n\\n He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs.\\nDoctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,\\n studied Wayne with abstract interest.\\n\\n\\n \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you couldn\\'t execute them?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The psycho you only wounded. He\\'s a five-times murderer. And that girl\\n killed her father when she was twelve. You realize there\\'s nothing can\\n be done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive\\n needs that must be expressed early, purged. There\\'s murder in all\\n of us, Seton. The impulse shouldn\\'t be denied or suppressed, but\\neducated\\n. The state used to kill them. Isn\\'t it better all around,\\n Seton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,\\n Seton?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I—felt sorry for her.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that all you can say about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor pressed a buzzer. Two men in white coats entered.\\n\\n\\n \"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it\\'s still\\n in there. I can\\'t turn you out and have it erupt later—and maybe shed\\n clean innocent blood, can I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir,\" Wayne mumbled. He didn\\'t look up. \"I\\'m sorry I punked out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back\\n to his mother.\"\\n\\n\\n Wayne nodded and they led him away. His mind screamed still to split\\n open some prison of bone and lay bare and breathing wide. But there\\n was no way out for the trapped. Now he knew about the old man and his\\n poker-playing pals.\\n\\n\\n They had all punked out.\\n\\n\\n Like him.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

If you could silence all\\n\\n radio—silence of that sort would be deadly!\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Astounding Science-Fiction April 1942.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe hurried\\nrat-a-tat\\nof knuckles hammered on the cabin door.\\n Commander Bob Curtis roused himself from his doze, got up from his\\n chair, stretched himself to his full, lanky height and yawned. That\\n would be Nelson, his navigating officer. Nelson always knocked that\\n way—like a man in an external state of jitters over nothing at all.\\n\\n\\n Curtis didn\\'t hurry. It pleased him to let Nelson wait. He moved slowly\\n to the door, paused there, and flung a backward glance at the man in\\n the cabin with him—Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest\\n of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser\\nComerford\\n.\\n\\n\\n The wizened face of the older man was molded in intent lines of\\n concentration, as his bushy gray head bent over his drawing board.\\n Curtis got a glimpse of the design on which he was working, and his\\n lips relaxed in a faint smile.\\n\\n\\n Androka had arrived on board the\\nComerford\\nthe day before she sailed\\n from Norfolk. With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and\\n equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks,\\n which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over\\n his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours\\n daily in the room in the superstructure that had been assigned as his\\n laboratory.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky—a scientist\\n whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country\\n under the domination of the Nazi\\ngestapo\\n. At other times, the man\\n seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer—a mad genius!\\n\\n\\n Curtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face\\n like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of\\n clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.\\n\\n\\n His eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before\\n him. It\\nwas\\nNelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down\\n over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands\\n fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white\\n cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.\\n\\n\\n The fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a\\n black-browed bos\\'n\\'s mate named Joe Bradford—the worst trouble maker\\n on board. But there was no question of his ability. He was a good\\n navigating officer—dependable, accurate, conscientious. Nevertheless,\\n his taut face, restless, searching eyes, and eternally nervous manner\\n got Curtis\\' goat.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in, Nelson!\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Nelson shouldered his way inside, and stood there in his dripping\\n oilskins, blinking his eyes against the yellow light.\\n\\n\\n Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor\\n Androka, with a quizzical grin. \"Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working\\n hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler\\'s teeth and re-establish\\n the Czech Republic!\"\\n\\n\\n Nelson had no answering smile, although there had been a great deal\\n of good-natured joking aboard the\\nComerford\\never since the navy\\n department had sent the scientist on board the cruiser to carry on his\\n experiments.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m worried, sir!\" Nelson said. \"I\\'m not sure about my dead reckoning.\\n This storm—\"\\n\\n\\n Curtis threw his arm around Nelson\\'s dripping shoulders. \"Forget it!\\n Don\\'t let a little error get you down!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But this storm, sir!\" Nelson avoided Curtis\\' friendly eyes and slipped\\n out from under his arm. \"It\\'s got me worried. Quartering wind of\\n undetermined force, variable and gusty. There\\'s a chop to the sea—as\\n if from unestimated currents among the islets. No chance to check by\\n observation, and now there is a chance—look at me!\"\\n\\n\\n He held out his hands. They were shaking as if he had the chills.\\n\\n\\n \"You say there is a chance?\" Curtis asked. \"Stars out?\"\\n\\n\\n \"As if by providence, sir, there\\'s a clear patch. I\\'m wondering—\" His\\n voice trailed off, but his eyes swung toward the gleaming sextant on\\n the rack.\\n\\n\\n Commander Curtis shrugged good-naturedly and reached for the\\n instrument. \"Not that I\\'ve lost confidence in you, Nels, but just\\n because you asked for it!\"\\nCurtis donned his slicker and went outside, sextant in hand. In a few\\n minutes he returned and handed Nelson a sheet of paper with figures\\n underlined heavily.\\n\\n\\n \"Here\\'s what I make it,\" the commander told his navigating officer.\\n \"Bet you\\'re not off appreciably.\"\\n\\n\\n Nelson stared at the computations with shaking head. Then he mutely\\n held up his own.\\n\\n\\n Curtis stared, frowned, grabbed his own sheet again. \"Any time I\\'m\\n that far off old Figure-\\'em Nelson\\'s estimate, I\\'m checking back,\" he\\n declared, frowning at the two papers and hastily rechecking his own\\n figures.\\n\\n\\n \"Call up to the bridge to stop her,\" he told Nelson. \"We can\\'t afford\\n to move in these waters with such a possibility of error!\"\\n\\n\\n Nelson complied, and the throbbing drive of the engines lessened\\n at once. Nelson said: \"I\\'ve been wondering, sir, if it wouldn\\'t be\\n advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks\\n and islets—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Radio?\" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the\\n other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship\\'s discipline.\\n \"You\\'re using your radio?\" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen\\n old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. \"Go ahead and try it. See\\n how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor\\n Androka decrees silence over the German airways! Try it! Try it, I say!\"\\n\\n\\n Bob Curtis stared at him, as if questioning his sanity. Then he\\n hastened to the radio room, with Nelson at his heels, and the Czech\\n trotting along behind.\\n\\n\\n The door burst open as they neared it. A frightened operator came out,\\n still wearing his earphones, and stood staring upward incredulously at\\n the aërial.\\n\\n\\n \"Get us a radio cross-bearing for location at once,\" Curtis said\\n sharply, for the operator seemed in a daze.\\n\\n\\n \"Bearing, sir?\" The man brought his eyes down with difficulty, as if\\n still dissatisfied. \"I\\'m sorry, sir, but the outfit\\'s dead. Went out on\\n me about five minutes ago. I was taking the weather report when the set\\n conked. I was trying to see if something\\'s wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n The Czech inventor giggled. Curtis gave him another curious look and\\n thrust himself into the radio room.\\n\\n\\n \"Try again!\" he told the operator. \"See what you can get!\"\\n\\n\\n The radio man leaped to his seat and tried frantically. Again and\\n again, he sent off a request for a cross-bearing from shore stations\\n that had recently been established to insure safety to naval vessels,\\n but there was no answer on any of the bands—not even the blare of a\\n high-powered commercial program in the higher reach, nor the chatter of\\n ships or amateurs on the shorter.\\n\\n\\n \"Dead!\" Androka muttered, with a bitter laugh. \"Yet not dead,\\n gentlemen! The set is uninjured. The waves are what have been upset. I\\n have shattered them around your ship, just as I can eventually shatter\\n them all over Central Europe! For the next two hours, no radio messages\\n can enter or leave my zone of radio silence—of refracted radio waves,\\n set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!\"\\nThere was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him.\\n Curtis was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\n \"Your secrecy might well cost the United States navy one of its best\\n light cruisers—and us our lives!\" he said angrily. \"We need that check\\n by radio at once! If you\\'re not talking nonsense, call off your dogs\\n till we learn just where we are!\"\\n\\n\\n Androka held out his palms helplessly. \"I can do nothing. I have given\\n orders to my assistant that he must keep two hours of radio silence! I\\n can get no message to him, for our radio is dead!\"\\n\\n\\n As if to mock him, the ship\\'s radio began to answer:\\n\\n\\n \"Station 297 calling U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\n. Station 297 calling U.\\n S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\n—\"\\n\\n\\n \"U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\ncalling Station 297!\" the operator intoned,\\n winking at the two officers over Androka\\'s discomfiture, and asked for\\n the bearings.\\n\\n\\n The answer came back: \"Bearings north east by a quarter east, U. S.\\n Cruiser\\nComerford\\n!\"\\n\\n\\n Curtis sighed with relief. He saw that Nelson was staring fiercely\\n at the radio operator, as the man went on calling: \"U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\ncalling Station 364. U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\ncalling\\n Station 364—\"\\n\\n\\n Then the instrument rasped again: \"Station 364 calling U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\n. Bearings north west by three west. Bearings north west by\\n three west, U. S. Cruiser\\nComerford\\nfrom Cay 364.\"\\n\\n\\n Commander and navigator had both scribbled verifications of the\\n numbers. Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his\\n disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence, they\\n raced for the chart room.\\nQuickly the parallels stepped off the bearing from the designated\\n points. Light intersecting lines proclaimed a check on their position.\\n\\n\\n Curtis frowned and shook his head. Slowly he forced a reluctant grin as\\n he stuck out his hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Shake, Nels,\" he said. \"It\\'s my turn to eat crow. You and the radio\\n must be right. Continue as you were!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m relieved, sir, just the same,\" Nelson admitted, \"to have the radio\\n bearings. We\\'d have piled up sure if you\\'d been right.\"\\n\\n\\n They went on through the night. The starlit gap in the clouds had\\n closed. The sky was again a blanket of darkness pouring sheets of rain\\n at them.\\n\\n\\n Nelson went back to the bridge, and Androka returned to the commander\\'s\\n cabin. Curtis lingered in the wireless room with the radio operator.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a funny thing,\" the latter said, still dialing and grousing, \"how\\n I got that cross-bearing through and can\\'t get another squeak out of\\n her. I\\'m wondering if that old goat really\\nhas\\ndone something to the\\n ether. The set seems O. K.\"\\n\\n\\n He lingered over the apparatus, checking and rechecking. Tubes lighted;\\n wires were alive to the touch and set him to shaking his head at the\\n tingle they sent through his inquiring fingers.\\n\\n\\n Curtis left him at it, and went to rejoin Androka in the cabin. He\\n found the little inventor pacing up and down, shaking his fists in the\\n air; pausing every now and then to run his bony fingers through his\\n tangled mop of gray hair, or to claw nervously at his beard.\\n\\n\\n \"You have seen a miracle, commander!\" he shouted at Curtis. \"\\nMy\\nmiracle! My invention has shattered the ether waves hereabouts\\n hopelessly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Seems to me,\" Curtis said dryly, \"this invention can harm your friends\\n as much as your enemies.\"\\n\\n\\n The scientist drew himself up to his full height—which was only a\\n little over five feet. His voice grew shrill. \"Wait! Just wait! There\\n are other inventions to supplement this one. Put them together, and\\n they will defeat the Nazi hordes which have ravaged my country!\"\\n\\n\\n Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka\\'s\\n eyes, under their bushy brows. There was something of the wild animal\\n in the man\\'s expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.\\n\\n\\n \"Those tanks you have below,\" Curtis said, \"have they some connection\\n with this radio silence?\"\\n\\n\\n A far-away look came into Androka\\'s eyes. He did not seem to hear\\n the question. He lowered his voice: \"My daughter is still in Prague.\\n So are my sister and her husband, and\\ntheir\\ntwo daughters. If the\\ngestapo\\nknew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You\\n understand—better dead?\"\\n\\n\\n Curtis said: \"I understand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And if the Nazi agents in America knew of the islet from which my zone\\n of silence is projected—\" Androka paused, his head tilted to one side,\\n as if he were listening to something—\\nOn deck, there was shouting and commotion. Curtis rushed out, pulling\\n on his slicker as he went. The shout from the watch forward had been\\n picked up, and was being relayed all over the ship. The words struck on\\n Curtis\\' ears with a note of impending tragedy.\\n\\n\\n \"Breakers ahead!\"\\n\\n\\n He was beside Navigating Officer Nelson on the bridge, and saw the\\n helmsman climbing the rapidly spinning wheel like a monkey as he put it\\n hard aport.\\n\\n\\n Then the ship struck. Everything movable shot ahead until it brought up\\n at the end of a swing or smacked against something solid.\\n\\n\\n Curtis felt Nelson\\'s hand grip his shoulder, as he put his lips close\\n to his ear and shouted: \"You must have been right, sir, and the radio\\n bearings and my reckoning wrong. We\\'ve hit that reef a terrific smack.\\n I\\'m afraid we\\'re gored!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get out the collision mat!\" Curtis ordered. \"We ought to be able to\\n keep her up!\"\\n\\n\\n And then he became aware of a deadly stillness. A vast wall of silence\\n enveloped the entire cruiser. Looking over the side, he could no longer\\n see the waves that a few minutes before had beaten savagely against the\\n ship.\\n\\n\\n The\\nComerford\\nwas shrouded in a huge pall of yellowish-gray mist, and\\n more of it was coming up from below—from ventilators and hatchways and\\n skylights—as if the whole ship were flooded with some evil vapor.\\n\\n\\n Somehow, Curtis\\' mind flashed to the stories he\\'d heard of the forts of\\n the Maginot Line, and of other forts in Holland and Belgium that had\\n fallen before the early Nazi blitzkrieg, when their defenders found\\n themselves struck numb and helpless by a gas that had been flooded into\\n the inner compartments of their strongholds.\\n\\n\\n There were those who said it was the work of sappers who had tunneled\\n under the foundations, while others laid the induction of the gas to\\n Fifth Column traitors. There were a hundred more or less plausible\\n explanations—\\n\\n\\n The vapor clouds that enveloped the\\nComerford\\nwere becoming thicker.\\n All about the deck lay the forms of unconscious seamen, suddenly\\n stricken helpless. And then Curtis saw other forms flitting about the\\n deck—forms that looked like creatures from another world, but he\\n recognized them for what they were—men wearing gas masks.\\n\\n\\n Nelson was nowhere in sight. The steersman lay in a limp heap beside\\n the swinging wheel. Then a gas-masked figure appeared through the\\n shroud of mist and steadied it, so that the cruiser would not be\\n completely at the mercy of the wind and the waves.\\n\\n\\n Curtis heard the anchor let down, as if by invisible hands, the chain\\n screaming and flailing its clanking way through the hawse hole. Then he\\n was completely walled in by the yellowish-gray mist. He felt his senses\\n swimming.\\n\\n\\n Voices droned all around him in mumbling confusion—guttural voices\\n that ebbed and flowed in a tide of excited talk. He caught a word of\\n English now and then, mixed in with a flood of Teuton phonetics.\\n\\n\\n Two words, in particular, registered clearly on his mind. One was\\n \"\\nCarethusia\\n\"; the other was \"convoy.\" But gradually his eardrums\\n began to throb, as if someone were pounding on them from the inside. He\\n couldn\\'t get his breath; a cloud seemed to be mounting within him until\\n it swept over his brain—\\n\\n\\n He felt something strike the side of his head, and realized that he had\\n fallen in a heap on the bridge. And after that, he wasn\\'t conscious of\\n anything—\\nThe rain had abated to a foggy drizzle. The wash of the surf swung the\\nComerford\\nin a lazy, rolling motion, as she lay with her bow nosing\\n into the sandbar at the entrance of the inlet.\\n\\n\\n From her bridge, Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked\\n figures moving about the decks, descending companionways—like goblins\\n from an ancient fairy tale or a modern horror story. Nelson looked like\\n a goblin himself, with his face covered by a respirator. At his side,\\n stood his fellow conspirator Bos\\'n\\'s Mate Joe Bradford, also wearing a\\n gas mask.\\n\\n\\n Nelson spoke in a low tone, his lips close to Bradford\\'s ear. \"It\\n worked, Joe!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah!\" Bradford agreed. \"It worked—fine!\"\\n\\n\\n The limp bodies of the\\nComerford\\'s\\ncrew were being carried to the\\n lowered accommodation ladder and transferred into waiting lifeboats.\\n\\n\\n Nelson swore under his breath. \"Reckon it\\'ll take a couple of hours\\n before the ship\\'s rid of that damn gas!\"\\n\\n\\n Bradford shook his head in disagreement. \"The old geezer claims he\\'s\\n got a neutralizing chemical in one of them tanks of his that\\'ll clear\\n everything up inside half an hour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d rather get along without Androka, if we could!\" Nelson muttered.\\n \"He\\'s nothing but a crackpot!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was a crackpot who invented the gas we used to break up the\\n Maginot Line,\" Bradford reminded him. \"It saved a lot of lives for the\\nFuehrer\\n—lives that\\'d have been lost if the forts had to be taken by\\n our storm troopers!\"\\n\\n\\n Nelson grunted and turned away. A short, thick-set figure in the\\n uniform of a German naval commander had ascended the accommodation\\n ladder and was mounting to the bridge. He, too, was equipped with a\\n respirator.\\n\\n\\n He came up to Nelson, saluted, and held out his hand, introducing\\n himself as Herr Kommander Brandt. He began to speak in German, but\\n Nelson stopped him.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t speak any German,\" he explained. \"I was born and educated in\\n the United States—of German parents, who had been ruined in the First\\n World War. My mother committed suicide when she learned that we were\\n penniless. My father—\" He paused and cleared his throat.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nJa!\\nYour father?\" the German officer prompted, dropping into\\n accented English. \"Your father?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My father dedicated me to a career of revenge—to wipe out his\\n wrongs,\" Nelson continued. \"If America hadn\\'t gone into the First\\n World War, he wouldn\\'t have lost his business; my mother would still\\n be living. When he joined the Nazi party, the way became clear to use\\n me—to educate me in a military prep school, then send me to Annapolis,\\n for a career in the United States navy—and no one suspected me. No\\n one—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" Bradford put in, \"I think Curtis suspected you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe Curtis\\'ll find out his suspicions were justified,\" Nelson said\\n bitterly. \"But it won\\'t do Curtis any good—a commander who\\'s lost\\n his ship.\" He turned to Brandt. \"You have plenty of men to work the\\nComerford\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Brandt nodded his square head. \"We have a full crew—two hundred\\n men—officers, seamen, mechanics, radio men, technical experts, all\\n German naval reservists living in the United States, who\\'ve been sent\\n here secretly, a few at a time, during the past six weeks!\"\\nThe three—Brandt, Nelson and Bradford—stood on the bridge and talked,\\n while the efficient stretcher-bearers worked industriously to remove\\n the limp bodies of the\\nComerford\\'s\\nunconscious crew and row them\\n ashore.\\n\\n\\n And when that task was completed, lifeboats began to come alongside\\n with strange-looking radio equipment, and more gas tanks like those\\n Androka had brought aboard the\\nComerford\\nwith him, and dynamos and\\n batteries that looked like something out of a scientific nightmare.\\n\\n\\n And bustling all over the place, barking excited commands in German,\\n pushing and pulling and pointing to emphasize his directions, was the\\n strange figure of Professor Zukor Androka!\\n\\n\\n \"The professor\\'s in his glory!\" Nelson remarked to Kommander Brandt.\\n\\n\\n \"Funny thing about him,\" Bradford put in, \"is that his inventions work.\\n That zone of silence cut us off completely.\"\\n\\n\\n Kommander Brandt nodded. \"Goodt! But you got your message giving your\\n bearings—the wrong ones?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Nelson said. \"That came through all right. And won\\'t Curtis have\\n a time explaining it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hereafter,\" Brandt said solemnly, \"the zone of silence vill be\\n projected from the\\nComerford\\n; and ve have another invention of\\n Androka\\'s vich vill be even more useful vhen ve come to cut the\\nCarethusia\\nout of her convoy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The\\nCarethusia\\n?\" Nelson asked, in a puzzled tone.\\n\\n\\n Brandt said: \"She\\'s a freighter in a convoy out of St. Johns—twelve\\n thousand tons. The orders are to take her; not sink her.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Her cargo,\" Brandt explained. \"It iss more precious than rubies. It\\n includes a large shipment of boarts.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Boarts?\" Nelson repeated. \"What are they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Boarts,\" Brandt told him, \"are industrial diamonds—black,\\n imperfectly crystallized stones, but far more valuable to us than\\n flawless diamonds from Tiffany\\'s on Fift\\' Avenue. They are needed for\\n making machine tools. They come from northern Brazil—and our supply is\\n low.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I should think we could get a shipment of these boarts direct from\\n Brazil—through the blockade,\" Nelson said, \"without taking the risk of\\n capturing a United States navy cruiser.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are other things Germany needs desperately on board the\\nCarethusia\\n,\" Brandt explained. \"Vanadium and nickel and hundreds of\\n barrels of lard oil for machine-tool lubrication. Our agents have been\\n watching the convoys closely for weeks for just such a cargo as the\\nCarethusia\\nis taking over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can we trust Androka?\" Nelson asked, with a sudden note of suspicion\\n in his voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Brandt assured him. \"Of all men—we can trust Androka!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he\\'s a Czech,\" Nelson argued.\\n\\n\\n \"The\\ngestapo\\ntakes care of Czechs and Poles and Frenchmen and other\\n foreigners whom it chooses as its agents,\" Brandt pointed out. \"Androka\\n has a daughter and other relations in Prague. He knows that if anything\\n misfires, if there is the slightest suspicion of treachery on his part,\\n his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka\\'s loyalty is assured!\"\\n\\n\\n Nelson turned to watch the forward fighting top of the\\nComerford\\n.\\n The masked German seamen were installing some sort of apparatus\\n up there—a strange-looking object that looked something like an\\n old-fashioned trench mortar, and which connected with cables to the\\n room that served as Androka\\'s laboratory and workshop.\\n\\n\\n Another crew was installing radio apparatus in the mizzentop turret.\\n\\n\\n Descending a companionway to see what was going on below, Nelson found\\n that portholes were being opened, and men were spraying chemical around\\n to rid the below-decks atmosphere of the lethal gas that had overcome\\n the\\nComerford\\'s\\nAmerican crew.\\n\\n\\n Returning to the bridge, he found that the tide in the inlet had risen\\n considerably, and that the cruiser was riding more easily at her anchor.\\n\\n\\n Then, at Brandt\\'s orders, the anchor was hauled in, and lifeboats and a\\n motor launch were used as tugs to work the vessel entirely free of the\\n sand bar. This was accomplished without difficulty.\\n\\n\\n Brandt came over to where Nelson was standing on the bridge and held\\n out his hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson!\" he said. \"Ve have stolen one\\n of the United States navy\\'s newest and fastest cruisers!\" He made a\\n gesture as if raising a beer stein to drink a toast. \"\\nProsit!\\n\" he\\n added.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nProsit!\\n\" Nelson repeated, and the two grinned at each other.\\nStars were twinkling in a patch of black-blue sky, and broken mountains\\n of gray cloud were skudding before the east wind. Commander Bob Curtis\\n found himself lying in wet sand, on a beach, somewhere, with the\\n rain—now a light, driving mist—beating on his face. He was chilled;\\n his limbs were stiff and numb. His nose and throat felt parched inside,\\n as if a wave of searing heat had scorched them.\\n\\n\\n According to his last calculations, the\\nComerford\\nhad been cruising\\n off the Maine coast. This probably was one of the islets of that\\n region, or it might be the mainland.\\n\\n\\n It was hard work getting to his feet, and when he did manage to stand,\\n he could only plant his heels in the sand and sway to and fro for fully\\n a minute, like a child learning to walk.\\n\\n\\n All around him in the nearly total darkness, he could make out the dim\\n forms of men sprawled on the beach; and of other men moving about,\\n exploring. He heard the murmur of voices and saw the glow of lighted\\n cigarettes.\\n\\n\\n A man with a flashlight was approaching him. Its white glare shone for\\n a moment in Curtis\\' face, and the familiar voice of Ensign Jack Dillon\\n spoke: \"Commander Curtis! Are you O. K., sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think so!\" Curtis\\' heart warmed at the eager expression in Dillon\\'s\\n face; at the heartfelt concern in his friendly brown eyes. The young\\n ensign was red-headed, impetuous, thoroughly genuine in his emotions.\\n \"How about yourself, Jack?\" Curtis added.\\n\\n\\n \"A bit of a headache from the gas, but that\\'s all. Any orders, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n Curtis thought for a moment. \"Muster the crew, as best you can. We\\'ll\\n try to make a roll call. Is there any sign of the ship?\"\\n\\n\\n There was a solemn note in Dillon\\'s voice. \"No, sir. She\\'s been worked\\n off the sandbar and put to sea!\"\\n\\n\\n The words struck Curtis with the numbing shock of a blow on some nerve\\n center. For the first time, he realized fully the tragedy that had\\n swept down on him. He had lost his ship—one of the United States\\n navy\\'s fastest and newest small light cruisers—under circumstances\\n which smelled strongly of treachery and sabotage.\\n\\n\\n As he thought back, he realized that he\\nmight\\nhave prevented the\\n loss, if he had been more alert, more suspicious. For it was clear to\\n him now that the\\nComerford\\nhad been deliberately steered to this\\n place; that the men who had seized her had been waiting here for that\\n very purpose.\\n\\n\\n The pieces of the picture fitted together like a jigsaw\\n puzzle—Androka\\'s zone of silence; the bearings given by radio;\\n Navigating Officer Nelson\\'s queer conduct. They were all part of a\\n carefully laid plan!\\n\\n\\n All the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nelson came flooding into\\n Curtis\\' mind. He had never liked the man; never trusted him. Nelson\\n always acted as if he had some secret, something to hide.\\n\\n\\n Curtis recalled that Nelson and Androka had long conversations\\n together—conversations which they would end abruptly when anyone else\\n came within earshot. And Nelson had always been chummy with the worst\\n trouble maker in the crew—Bos\\'n\\'s Mate Bradford.\\n\\n\\n Curtis went around, finding the officers, issuing orders. There were\\n still some unconscious men to be revived. In a sheltered cove among\\n the rocks, an exploring group had found enough dry driftwood to make a\\n fire—\\n\\n\\n In another hour, the skies had cleared, and white moonlight flooded\\n the scene with a ghostly radiance. The men of the\\nComerford\\nhad\\n all regained consciousness and were drying out in front of the big\\n driftwood bonfires in the cove.\\n\\n\\n Curtis ordered a beacon kept burning on a high promontory. Then he got\\n the men lined up, according to their respective classifications, for a\\n check-up on the missing.\\n\\n\\n When this was completed, it was found that the\\nComerford\\'s\\nentire\\n complement of two hundred and twenty men were present—except\\n Navigating Officer Nelson, and Bos\\'n\\'s Mate Bradford! And Zukor Androka\\n was also missing!\\n\\n\\n With the coming of dawn, a little exploration revealed that the\\nComerford\\'s\\ncrew was marooned on an islet, about a square mile in\\n area; that they had been put ashore without food or extra clothing or\\n equipment of any kind, and that no boats had been left for them.\\n\\n\\n One searching party reported finding the remains of what had been a\\n radio station on a high promontory on the north shore of the islet.\\n Another had found the remains of tents and log cabins, recently\\n demolished, in a small, timbered hollow—a well-hidden spot invisible\\n from the air, unless one were flying very low; a place where two\\n hundred or more men could have camped.\\n\\n\\n There was a good water supply—a small creek fed by springs—but\\n nothing in the way of food. Evidently food was a precious commodity\\n which the recent inhabitants of the islet couldn\\'t afford to leave\\n behind.\\n\\n\\n Curtis was studying the wreckage of the wireless station, wondering\\n if this might have been the source of Androka\\'s zone of silence, when\\n Ensign Jack Dillon came up to him.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a coast-guard cutter heading for the island, sir,\" he\\n announced.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The profit was enormous. The\\n\\n only trouble was—the cargo had a will of its own!\\nCaptain Hannah climbed painfully down from the\\nDelta Crucis\\n, hobbled\\n across the spaceport to where Beulah and I were waiting to greet him\\n and hit me in the eye. Beulah—that\\'s his elephant, but I have to take\\n care of her for him because Beulah\\'s baby belongs to me and Beulah has\\n to take care of it—kept us apart until we both cooled down a little.\\n Then, although still somewhat dubious about it, she let us go together\\n across the field to the spaceport bar.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t ask Captain Hannah why he had socked me.\\n\\n\\n Although he has never been a handsome man, he usually has the\\n weathered and austere dignity that comes from plying the remote reaches\\n among the stars. Call it the Look of Eagles. Captain Hannah had lost\\n the Look of Eagles. His eyes were swollen almost shut; every inch of\\n him that showed was a red mass of welts piled on more welts, as though\\n he had tangled with a hive of misanthropic bees. The gold-braided hat\\n of his trade was not clamped in its usual belligerent position slightly\\n over one eye. It was riding high on his head, apparently held up by\\n more of the ubiquitous swellings.\\n\\n\\n I figured that he figured that I had something to do with the way he\\n looked.\\n\\n\\n \"Shipping marocca to Gloryanna III didn\\'t turn out to be a cakewalk\\n after all?\" I suggested.\\n\\n\\n He glared at me in silence.\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps you would like a drink first, and then you would be willing to\\n tell me about it?\"\\n\\n\\n I decided that his wince was intended for a nod, and ordered rhial.\\n I only drink rhial when I\\'ve been exposed to Captain Hannah. It was\\n almost a pleasure to think that\\nI\\nwas responsible, for a change, for\\n having\\nhim\\ntake the therapy.\\n\\n\\n \"A\\nDelta\\nClass freighter can carry almost anything,\" he said at last,\\n in a travesty of his usual forceful voice. \"But some things it should\\n never try.\"\\nHe lapsed back into silence after this uncharacteristic admission. I\\n almost felt sorry for him, but just then Beulah came racking across\\n the field with her two-ton infant in tow, to show her off to Hannah. I\\n walled off my pity. He had foisted those two maudlin mastodons off onto\\n me in one of our earlier deals, and if I had somehow been responsible\\n for his present troubles, it was no more than he deserved. I rated\\n winning for once.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\ndid\\nsucceed in getting the marocca to Gloryanna III?\" I asked\\n anxiously, after the elephants had been admired and sent back home.\\n The success of that venture—even if the job had turned out to be more\\n difficult than we had expected—meant an enormous profit to both of\\n us. The fruit of the marocca is delicious and fabulously expensive.\\n The plant grew only on the single planet Mypore II. Transshipped seeds\\n invariably failed to germinate, which explained its rarity.\\n\\n\\n The Myporians were usually, and understandably, bitterly, opposed to\\n letting any of the living plants get shipped off their planet. But when\\n I offered them a sizable piece of cash plus a perpetual share of the\\n profits for letting us take a load of marocca plants to Gloryanna III,\\n they relented and, for the first time in history, gave their assent. In\\n fact, they had seemed delighted.\\n\\n\\n \"I got them there safely,\" said Captain Hannah.\\n\\n\\n \"And they are growing all right?\" I persisted.\\n\\n\\n \"When I left, marocca was growing like mad,\" said Captain Hannah.\\n\\n\\n I relaxed and leaned back in my chair. I no longer felt the need of\\n rhial for myself. \"Tell me about it,\" I suggested.\\n\"It was you who said that we should carry those damn plants to\\n Gloryanna III,\" he said balefully. \"I ought to black your other eye.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Simmer down and have some more rhial,\" I told him. \"Sure I get the\\n credit for that. Gloryanna III is almost a twin to Mypore II. You know\\n that marocca takes a very special kind of environment. Bright sun most\\n of the time—that means an almost cloudless environment. A very equable\\n climate. Days and nights the same length and no seasons—that means no\\n ecliptical and no axial tilt. But our tests showed that the plants had\\n enough tolerance to cause no trouble in the trip in\\nDelta Crucis\\n.\" A\\n light dawned. \"Our tests were no good?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your tests were no good,\" agreed the captain with feeling. \"I\\'ll tell\\n you about it first, and\\nthen\\nI\\'ll black your other eye,\" he decided.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll remember that I warned you that we should take some marocca\\n out into space and solve any problems we might find before committing\\n ourselves to hauling a full load of it?\" asked Captain Hannah.\\n\\n\\n \"We couldn\\'t,\" I protested. \"The Myporians gave us a deadline. If\\n we had gone through all of that rigamarole, we would have lost the\\n franchise. Besides, they gave you full written instructions about what\\n to do under all possible circumstances.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure. Written in Myporian. A very difficult language to translate.\\n Especially when you\\'re barricaded in the head.\"\\n\\n\\n I almost asked him why he had been barricaded in the bathroom of the\\nDelta Crucis\\n, but I figured it was safer to let him tell me in his\\n own way, in his own time.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"I got into parking orbit around Mypore without any\\n trouble. The plastic film kept the water in the hydroponic tanks\\n without any trouble, even in a no-gravity condition. And by the time I\\n had lined up for Gloryanna and Jumped, I figured, like you said, that\\n the trip would be a cakewalk.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you remember how the plants always keep their leaves facing the\\n sun? They twist on their stems all day, and then they go on twisting\\n them all night, still pointing at the underground sun, so that they\\'re\\n aimed right at sunrise. So the stem looks like a corkscrew?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. \"Sure. That\\'s why they can\\'t stand an axial tilt. They\\n \\'remember\\' the rate and direction of movement, and keep it up during\\n the night time. So what? We had that problem all figured out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You think so? That solution was one of yours, too, wasn\\'t it?\" He\\n gazed moodily at his beaker of rhial. \"I must admit it sounded good\\n to me, too. In Limbo, moving at multiple light-speeds, the whole\\n Universe, of course, turns into a bright glowing spot in our direction\\n of motion, with everything else dark. So I lined up the\\nDelta Crucis\\nperpendicular to her direction of motion, put a once-every-twenty-one\\n hour spin on her to match the rotation rates of Mypore II and Gloryanna\\n III, and uncovered the view ports to let in the light. It gradually\\n brightened until \\'noon time\\', with the ports pointing straight at the\\n light source, and then dimmed until we had ten and one-half hours of\\n darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, it didn\\'t work.\"\\n\"For Heaven\\'s sake, why not?\"\\n\\n\\n \"For Heaven\\'s sake why should it? With no gravity for reference, how\\n were the plants supposed to know that the \\'sun\\' was supposed to be\\n moving?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So what did you do?\" I asked, when that had sunk in. \"If the stem\\n doesn\\'t keep winding, the plants die; and they can only take a few\\n extra hours of night time before they run down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Captain Hannah in quiet tones of controlled desperation, \"it\\n was very simple. I just put enough spin on the ship to make artificial\\n gravity, and then I strung a light and moved it every fifteen minutes\\n for ten and one-half hours, until I had gone halfway around the room.\\n Then I could turn the light off and rest for ten and one-half hours.\\n The plants liked it fine.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, first I had to move all the hydroponic tanks from their\\n original positions perpendicular to the axial thrust line of the ship\\n to a radial position. And because somehow we had picked up half of\\n the plants in the northern hemisphere of Mypore and the other half in\\n the southern hemisphere, it turned out that half of the plants had a\\n sinistral corkscrew and the other half had a dextral. So I had to set\\n the plants up in two different rooms, and run an artificial sun for\\n each, going clockwise with one, widdershins with the other.\\n\\n\\n \"I won\\'t even talk about what I went through while I was shifting the\\n hydroponic tanks, when all the plastic membranes that were supposed to\\n keep the water in place started to break.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d like to know,\" I said sincerely.\\n\\n\\n He stared at me in silence for a moment. \"Well, it filled the cabin\\n with great solid bubbles of water. Water bubbles will oscillate and\\n wobble like soap bubbles,\" he went on dreamily, \"but of course,\\n they\\'re not empty, like soap bubbles. The surface acts a little like\\n a membrane, so that sometimes two of the things will touch and gently\\n bounce apart without joining. But just try\\ntouching\\none of them. You\\n could drown—I almost did. Several times.\\n\\n\\n \"I got a fire pump—an empty one. You know the kind; a wide cylinder\\n with a piston with a handle, and a hose that you squirt the water out\\n of, or can suck water in with. The way you use it is, you float up on\\n a big ball of water, with the pump piston down—closed. You carefully\\n poke the end of the hose into the ball of water, letting only the metal\\n tip touch.\\nNever\\nthe hose. If you let the hose touch, the water runs\\n up it and tries to drown you. Then you pull up on the piston, and draw\\n all the water into the cylinder. Of course, you have to hold the pump\\n with your feet while you pull the handle with your free hand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did it work?\" I asked eagerly.\\n\\n\\n \"Eventually. Then I stopped to think of what to do with the water.\\n It was full of minerals and manure and such, and I didn\\'t want to\\n introduce it into the ship\\'s tanks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you solved the problem?\"\\n\"In a sense,\" said the captain. \"I just emptied the pump back into the\\n air, ignored the bubbles, repositioned the tanks, put spin on the ship\\n and then ladled the liquid back into the tanks with a bucket.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t you bump into a lot of the bubbles and get yourself dunked a\\n good deal while you were working with the tanks?\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I couldn\\'t say. By that time I was ignoring them. It was\\n that or suicide. I had begun to get the feeling that they were stalking\\n me. So I drew a blank.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then after that you were all right, except for the tedium of moving\\n the lights around?\" I asked him. I answered myself at once. \"No. There\\n must be more. You haven\\'t told me why you hid out in the bathroom, yet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" said Captain Hannah. \"Like you, I figured I had the\\n situation fairly well under control, but like you, I hadn\\'t thought\\n things through. The plastic membranes hadn\\'t torn when we brought the\\n tanks in board the\\nDelta Crucis\\n. It never occurred to me to hunt\\n around for the reasons for the change. But I wouldn\\'t have had long to\\n hunt anyway, because in a few hours the reasons came looking for me.\\n\\n\\n \"They were a tiny skeeter-like thing. A sort of midge or junior grade\\n mosquito. They had apparently been swimming in the water during their\\n larval stage. Instead of making cocoons for themselves, they snipped\\n tiny little pieces of plastic to use as protective covers in the pupal\\n stage. I guess they were more like butterflies than mosquitoes in their\\n habits. And now they were mature.\\n\\n\\n \"There were thousands and thousands of them, and each one of them made\\n a tiny, maddening whine as it flew.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And they bit? That explains your bumps?\" I asked sympathetically.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, no. These things didn\\'t bite, they itched. And they got down\\n inside of everything they could get down inside, and clung. That\\n included my ears and my eyes and my nose.\\n\\n\\n \"I broke out a hand sprayer full of a DDT solution, and sprayed it\\n around me to try to clear the nearby air a little, so that I could\\n have room to think. The midges loved it. But the plants that were in\\n reach died so fast that you could watch their leaves curl up and drop\\n off.\\n\\n\\n \"I couldn\\'t figure whether to turn up the fans and dissipate the\\n cloud—by spreading it all through the ship—or whether to try to block\\n off the other plant room, and save it at least. So I ended up by not\\n doing anything, which was the right thing to do. No more plants died\\n from the DDT.\\n\"So then I did a few experiments, and found that the regular poison\\n spray in the ship\\'s fumigation system worked just fine. It killed\\n the bugs without doing the plants any harm at all. Of course, the\\n fumigation system is designed to work with the fumigator off the ship,\\n because it\\'s poisonous to humans too.\\n\\n\\n \"I finally blocked the vents and the door edges in the head, after\\n running some remote controls into there, and then started the\\n fumigation system going. While I was sitting there with nothing much\\n to do, I tried to translate what I could of the Myporian instructions.\\n It was on page eleven that it mentioned casually that the midges—the\\n correct word is carolla—are a necessary part of the life cycle of the\\n marocca. The larvae provide an enzyme without which the plants die.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. I immediately stopped slapping at the relatively few midges\\n that had made their way into the head with me, and started to change\\n the air in the ship to get rid of the poison. I knew it was too late\\n before I started, and for once I was right.\\n\\n\\n \"The only live midges left in the ship were the ones that had been\\n with me during the fumigation process. I immediately tried to start\\n a breeding ground for midges, but the midges didn\\'t seem to want to\\n cooperate. Whatever I tried to do, they came back to me. I was the only\\n thing they seemed to love. I didn\\'t dare bathe, or scratch, or even\\n wriggle, for fear of killing more of them. And they kept on itching. It\\n was just about unbearable, but I bore it for three interminable days\\n while the midges died one by one. It was heartbreaking—at least, it\\n was to me.\\n\\n\\n \"And it was unnecessary, too. Because apparently the carolla had\\n already laid their eggs, or whatever it is that they do, before I\\n had fumigated them. After my useless days of agony, a new batch\\n came swarming out. And this time there were a few of a much larger\\n thing with them—something like an enormous moth. The new thing just\\n blundered around aimlessly.\\n\\n\\n \"I lit out for the head again, to keep away from that intolerable\\n whining. This time I took a luxurious shower and got rid of most of the\\n midges that came through the door with me. I felt almost comfortable,\\n in fact, until I resumed my efforts to catch up on my reading.\\n\\n\\n \"The mothlike things—they are called dingleburys—also turn out to\\n provide a necessary enzyme. They are supposed to have the same timing\\n of their life cycle as the carolla. Apparently the shaking up I had\\n given their larvae in moving the tanks and dipping the water up in\\n buckets and all that had inhibited them in completing their cycle the\\n first time around.\\n\\n\\n \"And the reason they had the same life cycle as the carolla was that\\n the adult dinglebury will eat only the adult carolla, and it has to\\n fill itself full to bursting before it will reproduce. If I had the\\n translation done correctly, they were supposed to dart gracefully\\n around, catching carolla on the wing and stuffing themselves happily.\\n\\n\\n \"I had to find out what was wrong with my awkward dingleburys. And\\n that, of course, meant going out into the ship again. But I had to do\\n that anyway, because it was almost \\'daylight\\', and time for me to start\\n shifting the lights again.\\n\"The reason for the dingleburys\\' problem is fairly obvious. When you\\n set up artificial gravity by spinning a ship, the gravity is fine down\\n near the skin where the plants are. But the gravity potential is very\\n high, and it gets very light up where things fly around, going to zero\\n on the middle line of the ship. And the unfamiliar gravity gradient,\\n together with the Coriolis effect and all, makes the poor dingleburys\\n dizzy, so they can\\'t catch carolla.\\n\\n\\n \"And if you think I figured all that out about dingleburys getting\\n dizzy at the time, in that madhouse of a ship, then you\\'re crazy. What\\n happened was that I saw that there was one of the creatures that didn\\'t\\n seem to be having any trouble, but was acting like the book said it\\n should. I caught it and examined it. The poor thing was blind, and was\\n capturing her prey by sound alone.\\n\\n\\n \"So I spent the whole day—along with my usual chore of shifting the\\n lights—blindfolding dingleburys. Which is a hell of a sport for a man\\n who is captain of his own ship.\"\\n\\n\\n I must say that I agreed with him, but it seemed to be a good time for\\n me to keep my mouth shut.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, after the dingleburys had eaten and propagated, they became\\n inquisitive. They explored the whole ship, going into places I wouldn\\'t\\n have believed it to be possible for them to reach, including the inside\\n of the main computer, which promptly shorted out. I finally figured\\n that one of the things had managed to crawl up the cooling air exhaust\\n duct, against the flow of air, to see what was going on inside.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t dare to get rid of the things without checking my book, of\\n course, so it was back to the head for me. \\'Night\\' had come again—and\\n it was the only place I could get any privacy. There were plenty of the\\n carolla left to join me outside.\\n\\n\\n \"I showered and swatted and started to read. I got as far as where it\\n said that the dingleburys continued to be of importance, and then I\\'m\\n afraid I fell asleep.\\n\\n\\n \"I got up with the sun the next morning. Hell, I had to, considering\\n that it was I who turned the sun on! I found that the dingleburys\\n immediately got busy opening small buds on the stems of the marocca\\n plants. Apparently they were pollinating them. I felt sure that these\\n buds weren\\'t the marocca blossoms from which the fruit formed—I\\'d\\n seen a lot of those while we were on Mypore II and they were much\\n bigger and showier than these little acorn-sized buds.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, I should have translated some more of my instruction book,\\n but I was busy.\\n\\n\\n \"Anyway, the action of the dingleburys triggered the violent growth\\n phase of the marocca plants. Did you know that they plant marocca\\n seedlings, back on Mypore II,\\nat least\\na hundred feet apart? If\\n you\\'ll recall, a mature field, which was the only kind we ever saw, is\\n one solid mass of green growth.\\n\"The book says that it takes just six hours for a marocca field to\\n shift from the seedling stage to the mature stage. It didn\\'t seem that\\n long. You could\\nwatch\\nthe stuff grow—groping and crawling along; one\\n plant twining with another as they climbed toward the light.\\n\\n\\n \"It was then that I began to get worried. If they twined around the\\n light, they would keep me from moving it, and they would shadow it so\\n it wouldn\\'t do its job right. In effect, their growth would put out the\\n sun.\\n\\n\\n \"I thought of putting up an electrically charged fence around the\\n light, but the bugs had put most of my loose equipment out of action,\\n so I got a machete. When I took a swing at one of the vines, something\\n bit me on the back of the neck so hard it almost knocked me down. It\\n was one of the dingleburys, and it was as mad as blazes. It seems that\\n one of the things they do is to defend the marocca against marauders.\\n That was the first of my welts, and it put me back in the head in\\n about two seconds.\\n\\n\\n \"And what\\'s more, I found that I couldn\\'t kill the damn things. Not if\\n I wanted to save the plants. The growth only stops at the end of six\\n hours, after the blossoms appear and are visited by the dingleburys. No\\n dingleburys, no growth stoppage.\\n\\n\\n \"So for the next several hours I had to keep moving those lights, and\\n keep them clear of the vines, and keep the vines from shadowing each\\n other to the point where they curled up and died, and I had to do it\\ngently\\n, surrounded by a bunch of worried dingleburys.\\n\\n\\n \"Every time they got a little too worried, or I slipped and bumped into\\n a plant too hard, or looked crosseyed at them, they bit me. If you\\n think I look bad now, you should have seen me just about the time the\\n blossoms started to burst.\\n\\n\\n \"I was worried about those blossoms. I felt sure that they would smell\\n terrible, or make me sick, or hypnotize me, or something. But they just\\n turned out to be big, white, odorless flowers. They did nothing for me\\n or to me. They drove the dingleburys wild, though, I\\'m happy to say.\\n Made them forget all about me.\\n\\n\\n \"While they were having their orgy, I caught up on my reading. It\\n was necessary for me to cut back the marocca vines. For one thing,\\n I couldn\\'t get up to the area of the bridge. For another, the main\\n computer was completely clogged. I could use the auxiliary, on the\\n bridge, if I could get to it, but it\\'s a poor substitute. For another\\n thing, I would have to cut the stuff way back if I was ever going to\\n get the plants out of the ship. And I was a little anxious to get my\\nDelta Crucis\\nback to normal as soon as possible. But before cutting,\\n I had to translate the gouge.\\n\"It turns out that it\\'s all right to cut marocca as soon as it stops\\n growing. To keep the plants from dying, though, you have to mulch the\\n cuttings and then feed them back to the plants, where the roots store\\n whatever they need against the time of the next explosive period of\\n growth. Of course, if you prefer you can wait for the vines to die back\\n naturally, which takes several months.\\n\\n\\n \"There was one little catch, of course. The cuttings from the vines\\n will poison the plants if they are fed back to them without having been\\n mixed with a certain amount of processed mulch. Enzymes again. And\\n there was only one special processor on board.\\n\\n\\n \"I was the special processor. That\\'s what the instructions said—I\\n translated very carefully—it required an \\'organic processor\\'.\\n\\n\\n \"So I had to eat pounds of that horrible tasting stuff every day, and\\n process it the hard way.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t even have time to scratch my bites. I must have lost weight\\n everywhere but in the swollen places, and they looked worse than they\\n do now. The doctor says it may take a year before the bumps all go\\n away—if they ever do—but I have improved a lot already.\\n\\n\\n \"For a while I must have been out of my head. I got so caught up in\\n the rhythm of the thing that I didn\\'t even notice when we slipped out\\n of Limbo into real space near Gloryanna III. It was three days, the\\n Control Tower on Gloryanna III told me, that they tried continuously\\n to raise me on the communications gear before I heard the alarm bell\\n and answered them, so I had to do a good deal of backtracking before\\n I could get into parking orbit around the planet, and then set\\nDelta\\n Crucis\\ndown safely. Even as shaky as I was,\\nDelta Crucis\\nbehaved\\n like a lady.\\n\\n\\n \"I hadn\\'t chopped off all of the new growth, although I had the plants\\n down to manageable size. Some of the blossoms left on the plants had\\n formed fruit, and the fruit had ripened and dried, and the seeds had\\n developed fully. They were popping and spreading fine dust-like spores\\n all over the ship, those last few hours before I landed.\\n\\n\\n \"By that time, though, an occasional sneezing fit and watering eyes\\n didn\\'t bother me any. I was far beyond the point where hay fever could\\n add to my troubles.\\n\\n\\n \"When I opened the airlock door, though, the spores drifting outside\\n set the customs inspectors to sneezing and swearing more than seemed\\n reasonable at the time.\" Captain Hannah inhaled a sip of rhial, and\\n seemed to be enjoying the powerful stuff. He acted as if he thought he\\n had finished.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, go on,\" I urged him. \"The marocca plants were still in good\\n shape, weren\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n Hannah nodded. \"They were growing luxuriously.\" He nodded his head a\\n couple of more times, in spite of the discomfort it must have given\\n him.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"They made me burn the entire crop right away, of course. They\\n didn\\'t get all of the carolla or dingleburys, though. Or spores.\"\\n\"Gloryanna III is the original home planet of marocca. They hated the\\n stuff, of course, but they liked the profit. Then, when a plague almost\\n wiped out the dingleburys, they introduced khorram furs as a cash\\n crop. It wasn\\'t as lucrative, but it was so much more pleasant that\\n they outlawed marocca. Took them almost fifty years to stamp it out\\n completely. Meanwhile, some clever native shipped a load of the stuff\\n to Mypore II. He took his time, did it without any trouble and made his\\n fortune. And got out again quickly.\\n\\n\\n \"The Gloryannans were going to hold my\\nDelta Crucis\\nas security to\\n pay for the cost of stamping out marocca all over again—those spores\\n sprout fast—and for a time I was worried.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, when I showed them our contract—that you alone were\\n responsible for everything once I landed the plants safely on Gloryanna\\n III, they let me go.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll send you the bill. They don\\'t figure it will take them more\\n than a few months to complete the job.\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Hannah stopped talking and stood up, painfully and a little\\n unsteadily.\\n\\n\\n I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t even notice when he blacked my other eye. I was too\\n busy reaching for the rhial.\\nEND\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Perhaps there was method in Colonel\\n \\nWalsh\\'s madness—murder-madness—when he ordered Major\\n \\nPolk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\\n\\n November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\\n\\n U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nColonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\\n we went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\\n\\n\\n For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\\n He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\\n I liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\\n least, that\\'s what he told me.\\n\\n\\n I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\\n somewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\\n Space II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\\n it, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\\n then. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn\\'t going to let me get\\n by with gravy.\\n\\n\\n \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\\n his fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\\n\\n\\n I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don\\'t you send a green kid on\\n the job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\\n fingers.\\n\\n\\n \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\\n added, \"For a native, that is.\"\\n\\n\\n I had never liked Walsh\\'s attitude toward natives. I hadn\\'t liked the\\n way he\\'d treated the natives on Mars ever since he\\'d taken over there.\\n Which brought to mind an important point.\\n\\n\\n \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\\n thought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\\n\\n\\n He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\\n as if he were waiting for me to cut.\\n\\n\\n \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that\\'s true. But this is a special job. It so\\n happens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\\n what\\'s happening on Mars.\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn\\'t get very\\n far.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\\n anyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\\n\\n\\n If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\\n them to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\\n it \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we\\'d lost at\\n least a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\\n\\n\\n \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I\\'d never\\n been to Venus, being in Space II ever since I\\'d left the Moon run. It\\n was just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\\n\\n\\n At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I\\'d reported\\n him for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He\\'d goofed off on a pile of uranium\\n that could\\'ve, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\\n He still thought it was my fault, as if I\\'d done the wrong thing by\\n reporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\\n any military organization, he outranked me.\\n\\n\\n \"And the man\\'s name, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\\n\\n\\n \"Joe what?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Just Joe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just Joe?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\\n first names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\\n like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\\n\\n\\n \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\\n Personal habits? Anything?\"\\n\\n\\n Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he\\'s like\\n any of the other Venusians, so I can\\'t give you much help there. He\\n does have a peculiar habit, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\\n\\n\\n I sighed. \"Well, it\\'s not very much to go on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I\\'m sure of it.\"\\nThe trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on\\n that trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought\\n about Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that\\n revolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he\\'d started\\n pushing the natives around, there\\'d been trouble. It was almost as if\\n the whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took\\n over. Swell guy, Walsh.\\n\\n\\n Venus was hotter than I\\'d expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic\\n I was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn\\'t place. Like\\n a mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere\\n I looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I\\'d\\n never seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\\n\\n\\n I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me\\n about. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about\\n him was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have\\n been stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to\\n normal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\\n\\n\\n I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\\n\\n\\n He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance\\n between us in seconds.\\n\\n\\n \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this\\nwas\\ngoing to be a\\n simple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\\n\\n\\n \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at\\n his use of Terran idiom.\\n\\n\\n \"You are Joe, aren\\'t you? Joe the trader?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a\\n pocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began\\n wondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking\\n for. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately\\n upon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him\\n anyway, and there wasn\\'t much he could do if I decided to stop for a\\n drink first.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s the Officer\\'s Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a\\n heavily overgrown path. We\\'d probably walked for about ten minutes when\\n he dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\\n\\n\\n The Officer\\'s Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that\\n protected it from the heat of the sun. It didn\\'t look too comfortable\\n but I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped\\n the native thirty solars.\\n\\n\\n He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh\\n well, you\\'re new here. We\\'ll let it go.\"\\n\\n\\n He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he\\'d\\n meant. Had I tipped him too little?\\n\\n\\n I shrugged and looked over at the Officer\\'s Club. From the outside it\\n looked as hot as hell.\\n\\n\\n On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to\\n curse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\\n\\n\\n There wasn\\'t much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game\\n and a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\\n\\n\\n I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\\n\\n\\n He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Joe,\" he said again.\\n\\n\\n A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\\n \"You wouldn\\'t happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about\\n Mars, would you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\\n\\n\\n That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\\nBut then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like\\nJoe.\\nAmong the natives, I mean.\\nSure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most\\n contemptible....\\n\\n\\n \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\\n\\n\\n \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain\\'s shack?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Follow your nose, pal. Can\\'t miss it.\"\\n\\n\\n I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at\\n the bartender.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How\\'s it going?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\\n\\n\\n I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh\\'s idea of a\\n great gag. Very funny. Very....\\n\\n\\n \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who\\'d just come in asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\\n\\n\\n \"You better get your butt over to the captain\\'s shack,\" he said. \"He\\'s\\n about ready to post you as overdue.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\\n\\n\\n \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\\n\\n\\n \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back.\\nCaptain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\\n a tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\\n an officer.\\n\\n\\n \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\\n desk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\\n was empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\\n open. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\\n some, please?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\\n door behind him.\\nAnother Joe\\n, I thought.\\nAnother damned Joe.\\n\"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\\n\\n\\n \"Steal what?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\\n they like about Terran culture.\"\\n\\n\\n So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\\nHe does have a peculiar\\n habit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\\nCigarettes\\n was the tip I should have given; not solars.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\\n I think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\\n\\n\\n Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn\\'t think it\\n was so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer\\'s gaze and\\n waited for his explanation.\\n\\n\\n \"I hadn\\'t realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It\\'s a simple culture, you\\n know. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\\n\\n\\n \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\\n Lots of enlisted men, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh\\'s doubtful\\n ancestry more keenly.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\\n Bransten was saying.\\n\\n\\n I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\\n sitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\\n\\n\\n \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\\n\\n\\n \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\\n wasn\\'t used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\\n they are. They\\'ll ask a native to do something and they\\'ll call him\\n Joe. \\'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.\\' Or \\'Listen, Joe, how\\'d you\\n like to earn some cigarettes?\\' Do you follow?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\\n are a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them—the Joe\\n business, I mean. Now they\\'re all Joe. They like it. That and the\\n cigarettes.\"\\n\\n\\n He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\\n personally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\\n he were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\\n place.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n Just a case of extended\\nidiot\\n, I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\\n chase a hell of a long way from home.\\n\\n\\n \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\\n\\n\\n Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\\n me that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\\n Venusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\\n\\n\\n I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\\n stuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\\n tunic.\\n\\n\\n I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\\n of thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\\n twinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\\n\\n\\n Walsh\\'s face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\\n pussy cat.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\\n\\n\\n Walsh\\'s grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you\\'re not having any\\n difficulties, are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I\\'d be able to find him\\n a lot sooner if....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There\\'s no rush at all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought....\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn\\'t have sent you\\n otherwise.\"\\n\\n\\n Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\\n\\n\\n I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\\n big white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\\n surprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\\n away.\\n\\n\\n He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I\\'d deliberately hung up on\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\\n\\n\\n I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\\n on my end went blank, too.\\nHe\\'s somewhere in the jungle, you know.\\nI thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\\n quarters.\\n\\n\\n As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\\n\\n\\n One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\\n the next ship back to Earth.\\n\\n\\n It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\\n It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\\n Service altogether.\\n\\n\\n Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\\n jungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\\n trader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\\n course, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\\n really find a guy who was trader Joe.\\n\\n\\n I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\\n besides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\\n life. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\\n was I\\'d try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\\n\\n\\n I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\\n\\n\\n A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\\n\\n\\n \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\\n\\n\\n \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I\\'ll need a guide to take me\\n into the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'ll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\\n\\n\\n \"How much?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who\\'s the guide?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'s the price sound?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\\n almost a childish people!\\n\\n\\n \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\\n planet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\\n Courageous. Doesn\\'t know the meaning of fear. I\\'ve known him to....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\\n around fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we\\'ll need.\"\\n\\n\\n The Venusian started to leave.\\n\\n\\n \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you\\'re not\\n overlooking your commission on the deal.\"\\n\\n\\n His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I\\'d\\n just have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\\n a planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\\n Captain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\\nI began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of\\n me. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed\\n like a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something\\n that had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I\\'d be\\n back again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set\\n for me.\\n\\n\\n Or maybe he didn\\'t expect me to come back.\\n\\n\\n The thought hadn\\'t occurred to me before this, and I began to consider\\n it seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing\\n at the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a\\n few more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with\\n Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken\\n place like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too.\\n But what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in\\n command. If he were transferred, I\\'d be in charge of Space II, and I\\n could understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.\\n\\n\\n I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good\\n points against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A\\n guy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of\\n uranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn\\'t watched,\\n would deliberately do just about anything.\\n\\n\\n Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may\\n have been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a\\n gag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.\\n\\n\\n The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall,\\n elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I\\'d seen so far.\\n\\n\\n \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\"\\n\\n\\n I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.\\n\\n\\n \"When can we leave?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right away, sir. We won\\'t need much really. I\\'ve made a list of\\n supplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear\\n light clothing, boots, and a hat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will I need a weapon?\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What\\'s your name, by the way?\"\\n\\n\\n He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was\\n definitely surprised.\\n\\n\\n \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn\\'t you know?\"\\nWhen we\\'d been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\\n boots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\\n would have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\\n high boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\\n\\n\\n Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\\n enjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\\n pleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn\\'t\\n see three feet ahead of me. He\\'d stand stock still for a few minutes,\\n his head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\\n Then he\\'d say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\\n impenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\\n to another village.\\n\\n\\n Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\\n huts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\\n me a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\\n\\n\\n Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\\n stinking, hot jungle. And I wasn\\'t getting any nearer my man. Nor had\\n I any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\\n about the whole affair.\\n\\n\\n Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\\n village he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\\n gossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\\n to all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\\n\\n\\n His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\\n that would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\\n would talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\\n\\n\\n \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\\n for Venus. And they are fun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\\n Leonard Walsh.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\\n well, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\\n\\n\\n Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\\n that I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\\n just my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\\n employee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\\n began to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\\n the people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\\n tests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\\n sympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\\n\\n\\n And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\\n friendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\\n grinding pace to find what we were looking for.\\n\\n\\n Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\\n greenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\\n gleaming in his belt. I\\'d seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\\n vines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\\n through them like strips of silk.\\n\\n\\n \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\\n\\n\\n I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are more villages,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll never find him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\\n\\n\\n \"A wild goose chase. A fool\\'s errand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'d better get started,\" Joe said simply.\\n\\n\\n I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\\n brilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\\n feeling I\\'d had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\\n friends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\\n own house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\\n reminded me of that friend.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\\n now, his eyes shining.\\nSomething was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\\n to greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the story?\" I whispered.\\n\\n\\n He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\\n\\n\\n And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\\n the sun like a great silver bullet.\\n\\n\\n \"What...?\" I started.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\\n\\n\\n The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\\n the nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\\n standing near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn\\'t look\\n cheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\\n\\n\\n \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\\n joviality. Somehow it didn\\'t quite come off.\\n\\n\\n Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\\n happiness.\\n\\n\\n \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\\n\\n\\n I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\\n was getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\\n\\n\\n I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what\\'s it all about, pal?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn\\'t forget to say Colonel,\\nMajor\\n.\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\\n finality.\\n\\n\\n I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he\\'d\\n been. Besides, there wasn\\'t much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\\n pointing the stun gun at my middle.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve come a long way since the Academy, haven\\'t we, Major?\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\\n have.\"\\n\\n\\n Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\\n smile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I\\'m\\n going to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\\n it\\'ll rain tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\\n this. Another of those funny Terran games.\\n\\n\\n \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\\n should thank you, really.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re welcome,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"It wasn\\'t easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\\n when you decided to cork off.\"\\n\\n\\n Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t have to report me,\" Walsh said.\\n\\n\\n \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\\n nudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\\n sometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\\n\\n\\n Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\\n audible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\\n little spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\\n unimportant drama.\\n\\n\\n I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\\n\\n\\n \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\\n\\n\\n Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe\\'s face. Apparently he couldn\\'t\\n understand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\\n game, the fun?\\n\\n\\n \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\\n never any trouble before you took command.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\\n\\n\\n Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\\n say about the natives. Apparently he\\'d realized that Joe was a native.\\n Or maybe Joe\\'s knife had something to do with it.\\n\\n\\n \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\\n\\n\\n \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\\n savages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\\n The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe\\'s face. He looked at the\\n colonel in puzzlement.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Not even forever\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, April 1958.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.\\n\\n\\n The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly\\n hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in\\n the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always\\n seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what\\n they sought.\\nThe horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would\\n be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,\\n and when they reached the water\\'s edge, he dismounted and unsaddled\\n the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting\\n torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it\\n into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more\\n through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,\\n and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.\\n\\n\\n When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red\\n light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet\\n shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered\\n driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of\\n the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water\\n from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he\\n waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his\\n mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy\\n slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.\\n\\n\\n In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding\\n coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the\\n dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching\\n at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but\\n ashes.\\n\\n\\n Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill\\n his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.\\n\\n\\n He slept. His brain slept.\\n\\n\\n But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;\\n all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible\\n files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....\\nIt was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been\\n declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He\\n was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the\\n children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the\\n blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got something to tell you, and something to show you.\"\\n\\n\\n He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry\\n of surprised joy.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, a ring, and it\\'s a diamond, too!\" she cried in her rich, happy\\n voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s for you; so long as you wear it, I\\'ll come back, even from the\\n dead, if need be. Read the inscription.\"\\n\\n\\n She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, \"It is forever.\"\\n\\n\\n Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.\\n He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into\\n his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in\\n his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where\\n he had been many times before but each time found something new and\\n unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait!\" she cried. \"I\\'ve something for you, too.\"\\n\\n\\n She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the\\n shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught\\n the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the\\n room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one\\n large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her\\n in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in\\n his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in\\n it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into\\n the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.\\n\\n\\n The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,\\n sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off\\n in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch\\n until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house\\n and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a\\n little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the\\n blood in his veins.\\n\\n\\n Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another\\n division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris\\n where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,\\n littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been\\n great.\\n\\n\\n Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand\\n miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory\\n was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of\\n annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.\\n\\n\\n He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for\\n bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the\\n air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return\\n to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary\\n soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It\\n grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.\\n\\n\\n \"Heavy bombers!\" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for\\n their foxholes.\\n\\n\\n But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,\\n reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important\\n targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their\\n shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which\\n covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....\\n\\n\\n Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers\\n flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high\\n screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.\\n The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing\\n bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,\\n victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked\\n across the sky which none could escape.\\n\\n\\n But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the\\n helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had\\n stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted\\n buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud\\n filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other\\n cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted\\n away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where\\n they had crawled.\\n\\n\\n The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,\\n if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.\\n Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown\\n of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful\\n sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and\\n merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.\\n\\n\\n The war had ended.\\n\\n\\n To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority\\n of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their\\n governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that\\n remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what\\n they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.\\n\\n\\n They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held\\n nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to\\n dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.\\n\\n\\n Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their\\n exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the\\n few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that\\n she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to\\n return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.\\n\\n\\n They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He\\n and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they\\n reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he\\n had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.\\n\\n\\n After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked\\n somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,\\n and had been found by a fisherman\\'s family. Many months he had spent\\n swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the\\n United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the\\n Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had\\n been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across\\n the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,\\n and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by\\n the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into \"El Mundo gris\\n de Noviembre\"—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.\\n\\n\\n In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had\\n waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In\\n the November world.\\n\\n\\n It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,\\n leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,\\n temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the\\n ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,\\n and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he\\n had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what\\n might have been dead leaves, but wasn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly\\n exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food\\n there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had\\n found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice\\n as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like\\n glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,\\n straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were\\n the animal\\'s eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which\\n he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and\\n seemed to say: \"Follow me.\"\\n\\n\\n And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and\\n finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it\\n empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had\\n remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could\\n only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he\\n had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again\\n started the long journey home.\\n\\n\\n The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He\\n had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the\\n plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen\\n no human beings.\\n\\n\\n But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.\\n How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of\\n what it had once been. He could not be more than two days\\' ride away.\\n Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with\\n her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.\\nThe images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and\\n mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.\\n\\n\\n He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of\\n the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling\\n mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the\\n length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,\\n separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his\\n body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his\\n lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in\\n every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long\\n grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.\\n He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.\\n\\n\\n Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun\\n was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a\\n burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and\\n the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with\\n streaming hair called stars.\\n\\n\\n In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its\\n very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse\\n stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,\\n slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard\\n voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.\\n He turned quickly away and did not look back.\\n\\n\\n Night paled into day; day burned into night.\\n\\n\\n There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat\\n from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible\\n through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.\\n\\n\\n Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the\\n window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged\\n gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed\\n to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that\\n he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even\\n better than it had been before.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw her.\\n\\n\\n She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the\\n fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve\\n shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred\\n like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile\\n of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught\\n quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of\\n light around her.\\n\\n\\n His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a\\n monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was\\n no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,\\n mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were\\n empty of life.\\n\\n\\n \"No, no!\" he cried soundlessly.\\n\\n\\n This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had\\n found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.\\n He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the\\n creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from\\n one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if\\n trying to decipher some inscription inside it.\\n\\n\\n He knew then. He had come home.\\n\\n\\n Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His\\n feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,\\n shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking\\n up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that\\n passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a\\n kind of fear he had never known.\\n\\n\\n He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around\\n his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it\\n safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp\\n and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened\\n it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer\\n faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby\\n had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob\\n of darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing is forever!\" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a\\n thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.\\n\\n\\n He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the\\n doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.\\n \"Forever—forever. Only death is forever.\" He could have sworn he heard\\n the words.\\n\\n\\n He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the\\n center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt\\n of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his\\n chest.\\n\\n\\n Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the\\n vast emptiness.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited\\n men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,\\n were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian\\n features, and talked foreign languages.\\n\\n\\n They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn\\'t were scurrying\\n individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.\\n\\n\\n Chess sets were everywhere—big ones on tables, still bigger\\n diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from\\n side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational\\n ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny\\n magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.\\n\\n\\n There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:\\n FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about\\n the last three.\\n\\n\\n The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar\\n note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over\\n their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That\\n Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck\\n Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance.\\nHer last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the\\n first American manned circum-lunar satellite—and the five alternate\\n pairs who hadn\\'t made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra\\n much further out of the world.\\n\\n\\n Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English\\n were not particularly helpful. Samples:\\n\\n\\n \"They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure\\n Barcza System and Indian Defenses—and the Dragon Formation if anyone\\n pushes the King Pawn.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah! In that case....\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and\\n they\\'ll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey\\n computer do against four Russian grandmasters?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I heard the Russians have been programmed—with hypnotic cramming and\\n somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, the Machine hasn\\'t even a\\nHaupturnier\\nor an intercollegiate\\n won. It\\'ll over its head be playing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler\\n at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and\\n Circum-Terra?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra\\'s chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about\\n the game of chess—a point that she had slid over in conferring with\\n the powers at the\\nSpace Mirror\\n, but that now had begun to weigh on\\n her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,\\n find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way.\\n\"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re durn tootin\\' she would!\" Sandra replied in a rush, and then\\n looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.\\n\\n\\n It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat\\n thinned down Peter Lorre—there was that same impression of the happy\\n Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,\\n making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in\\n sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing\\n a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra\\'s—a\\n circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow\\n conspirators.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, wait a minute,\" she protested just the same. He had already taken\\n her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide\\n stairs. \"How did you know I wanted a drink?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,\" he\\n replied, keeping them moving. \"Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your\\n lovely throat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t suppose they\\'d serve drinks here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But of course.\" They were already mounting the stairs. \"What would\\n chess be without coffee or schnapps?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, lead on,\" Sandra said. \"You\\'re the doctor.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor?\" He smiled widely. \"You know, I like being called that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then the name is yours as long as you want it—Doc.\"\\nMeanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small\\n cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.\\n He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned\\n waiter materialized.\\n\\n\\n \"For myself black coffee,\" he said. \"For mademoiselle rhine wine and\\n seltzer?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'d go fine.\" Sandra leaned back. \"Confidentially, Doc, I was\\n having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded. \"You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by\\n chess,\" he assured her. \"It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game\\n for lunatics—or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and\\n beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they\\n were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.\\n\\n\\n \"You have one great advantage,\" he told her. \"You know nothing\\n whatsoever of chess—so you will be able to write about it\\n understandably for your readers.\" He swallowed half his demitasse and\\n smacked his lips. \"As for the Machine—you\\ndo\\nknow, I suppose, that\\n it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking\\n like a late medieval knight in armor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Doc, but....\" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait.\" He lifted a finger. \"I think I know what you\\'re going to ask.\\n You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn\\'t work\\n perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc\\'s ability to interpret her mind was as\\n comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.\\n\\n\\n He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced\\n them.\\n\\n\\n \"If you had,\" he said, \"a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,\\n it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just\\n to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the\\n time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for\\n White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to\\n trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine\\n can\\'t play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the\\n likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead—that is, four moves\\n each for White and Black—and then decide which is the best move on the\\n basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing\\n a powerful central position and so on.\"\\n\"That sounds like the way a man would play a game,\" Sandra observed.\\n \"Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting\\n out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly!\" Doc beamed at her approvingly. \"The Machine\\nis\\nlike a\\n man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always\\n abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of\\n genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human\\n interest already, even in the Machine.\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra nodded. \"Does a human chess player—a grandmaster, I mean—ever\\n look eight moves ahead in a game?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there\\'s a\\n chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines\\n many more moves ahead than that—thirty or forty even. The Machine\\n is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something\\n of the same sort, though we can\\'t be sure from the information World\\n Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the\\n possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can\\n only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and\\n experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the\\n directions fed into it before it plays a game.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean the programming?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the\\n chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by\\n Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves\\n ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab\\n at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It\\n had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub—a\\n dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing\\n material—but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.\\n The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as\\n fast. Don\\'t ask me how, I\\'m no physicist, but it depends on the new\\n transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn\\n depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute\\n zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead\\n and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it\\n only sees twice as many moves ahead?\" Sandra objected.\\n\\n\\n \"There is a geometrical progression involved there,\" he told her\\n with a smile. \"Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when\\n you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of\\n thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games\\n by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves\\n ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,\\n you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!\"\\n\\n\\n A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,\\n gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc\\n and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue.\\nSandra\\'s gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look\\n down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the\\n middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely\\n apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set\\n out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,\\n about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people\\n still wandering about.\\n\\n\\n On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the\\n corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White\\n squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.\\n\\n\\n One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other\\n four—the one above the Machine.\\n\\n\\n Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine—a\\n bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny\\n telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on\\n little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about\\n ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of\\n them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were\\n attaching it to the Siamese clock.\\n\\n\\n Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but\\n only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who\\n never made a mistake....\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.\"\\n\\n\\n She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.\\n\\n\\n \"I should tell you, Igor,\" Doc continued, \"that Miss Grayling\\n represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you\\n have a message for her readers.\"\\n\\n\\n The shock-headed man\\'s eyes flashed. \"I most certainly do!\" At that\\n moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.\\n Jandorf seized Doc\\'s new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray\\n with a flourish and drew himself up.\\n\"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,\" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his\\n eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, \"that I, Igor Jandorf,\\n will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!\\n Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold—I, who\\n have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I\\n have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit—an offer no\\n true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict\\n that the Machine will play like a great oaf—at least against\\nme\\n.\\n Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,\\n will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" Sandra assured him, \"but there are some other questions I\\n very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten\\n minutes they start the clocks.\"\\n\\n\\n While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day\\'s\\n playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.\\n\\n\\n \"One expects it of Jandorf,\" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic\\n shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. \"At least he didn\\'t take your\\n wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don\\'t call a chess\\n master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gee, Doc, I don\\'t know how to thank you for everything. I hope I\\n haven\\'t offended Mis—Master Jandorf so that he doesn\\'t—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry about that. Wild horses couldn\\'t keep Jandorf away from a\\n press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.\\n That\\'s a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds\\n to make a move. Which I don\\'t suppose would give the Machine time to\\n look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a\\n very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the\\n usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that why they\\'ve got all those crazy clocks?\" Sandra interrupted.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his\\n moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his\\n clock off and turns his opponent\\'s on. If a player uses too much time,\\n he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine\\n will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time\\n on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4\\n minutes a move—and it will need every second of them! Incidentally\\n it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold\\n challenge—just as if the Machine weren\\'t playing blindfold itself. Or\\nis\\nthe Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gosh, I don\\'t know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf\\n has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can\\'t believe that.\"\\n\"Of course not!\" Doc assured her. \"It was only 49 and he lost two of\\n those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It\\'s in his blood.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s one of the Russians, isn\\'t he?\" Sandra asked. \"Igor?\"\\n\\n\\n Doc chuckled. \"Not exactly,\" he said gently. \"He is originally a Pole\\n and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists\\n of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard.\\nTHE PLAYERS\\nWilliam Angler, USA\\n\\n Bela Grabo, Hungary\\n\\n Ivan Jal, USSR\\n\\n Igor Jandorf, Argentina\\n\\n Dr. S.

Waiter! I\\'m here, not there!\" And he went\\n charging off.\\n\\n\\n Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.\\n\\n\\n \"Chess masters aren\\'t exactly humble people, are they?\" she said.\\n\\n\\n Doc\\'s smile became tinged with sad understanding. \"You must excuse\\n them, though,\" he said. \"They really get so little recognition or\\n recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal\\n of ego to play greatly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this\\n tournament?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.\\n They want to score a point over their great rival.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,\"\\n Sandra pointed out.\\n\\n\\n \"True,\" Doc agreed thoughtfully. \"WBM must feel very sure.... It\\'s\\n the prize money they\\'ve put up, of course, that\\'s brought the world\\'s\\n greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off\\n in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize\\n money is fabulous—$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all\\n expenses paid for all players. There\\'s never been anything like it.\\n Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded\\n her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players\\n are here because UNESCO and FIDE \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthat\\'s\\nFederation Internationale\\n des Echecs\\n—the international chess organization\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m are also backing\\n the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little\\n prestige now that its space program is sagging.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But if a Russian doesn\\'t take first place it will be a black eye for\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n Doc frowned. \"True, in a sense.\\nThey\\nmust feel very sure.... Here\\n they are now.\"\\nFour men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,\\n toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be\\n going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of\\n a phalanx.\\n\\n\\n \"The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,\" Doc told her. \"It isn\\'t often\\n that you see the current champion of the world—Votbinnik—and an\\n ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament\\n who have held that honor—Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh no. That\\'s decided by two-player matches—a very long\\n business—after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.\\n This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every\\n other player. That means nine rounds.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anyway there\\nare\\nan awful lot of Russians in the tournament,\"\\n Sandra said, consulting her program. \"Four out of ten have USSR after\\n them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary—that\\'s a satellite. And Sherevsky and\\n Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament\\n represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength\\n between the two countries,\" Doc said judiciously. \"Chess mastery\\n moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems\\n and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a\\n hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria\\n and the New World. Now it\\'s Russia—including of course the Russians\\n who have run away from Russia. But don\\'t think there aren\\'t a lot of\\n good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,\\n there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don\\'t\\n think so. It\\'s just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking\\n Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short\\n bald-headed man?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Now that\\'s one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.\\n Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox\\n Jew. Can\\'t play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown.\" He\\n chuckled. \"Why, there\\'s even a story going around that one rabbi told\\n Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine\\n because it is technically a\\ngolem\\n—the clay Frankenstein\\'s monster of\\n Hebrew legend.\"\\n\\n\\n Sandra asked, \"What about Grabo and Krakatower?\"\\nDoc gave a short scornful laugh. \"Krakatower! Don\\'t pay any attention\\n to\\nhim\\n. A senile has-been, it\\'s a scandal he\\'s been allowed to play\\n in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them\\n that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they\\n had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down\\n on his knees and cried—and all the time his eyes on that expense money\\n and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically\\n of beating them all! Please, don\\'t get me started on Dirty Old\\n Krakatower.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting\\n article? Can you point him out to me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don\\'t\\n see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he\\'s shaved it off for the occasion.\\n It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of\\n youthfulness.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Grabo?\" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of\\n Doc\\'s animosity.\\n\\n\\n Doc\\'s eyes grew thoughtful. \"About Bela Grabo \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mwhy are three out of\\n four Hungarians named Bela?\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m I will tell you only this: That he is a\\n very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn\\n him as its first opponent.\"\\n\\n\\n He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.\\n\\n\\n \"This Simon Great who\\'s down as programming the Machine. He\\'s a famous\\n physicist, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\\n \"By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing\\n machines—they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a\\n psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world\\'s\\n chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him\\n for the programming job. Let me tell you—No, better yet—\"\\n\\n\\n Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,\\n \"Simon!\"\\n\\n\\n A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it, Savilly?\" he asked. \"There\\'s hardly any time, you know.\"\\nThe newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with\\n graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.\\n\\n\\n Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.\\n\\n\\n Simon Great smiled thinly. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"But I am making no\\n predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the\\n programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the\\n Players\\' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that\\n and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the\\n Machine at adjournments—only between games \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mI did insist on that and\\n get it!\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps\\n running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs—if they can work\\n fast enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That makes it very tough on you,\" Sandra put in. \"The Machine isn\\'t\\n allowed any weaknesses.\"\\n\\n\\n Great nodded soberly. \"And now I must go. They\\'ve almost finished the\\n count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased\\n to have met you, Miss Grayling—I\\'ll check with our PR man on that\\n interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.\"\\n\\n\\n The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.\\n Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the\\n grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.\\n Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards\\n lit up with the pieces in the opening position—white for White and red\\n for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash\\n bulbs went off.\\n\\n\\n \"You know, Doc,\" Sandra said, \"I\\'m a dog to suggest this, but what\\n if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really\\n playing the Machine\\'s moves? There would surely be some way for his\\n electricians to rig—\"\\n\\n\\n Doc laughed happily—and so loudly that some people at the adjoining\\n tables frowned.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for\\n a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.\\n No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such\\n a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament\\n play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between\\n a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great\\'s own style\\n is remembered and would be recognized—though, come to think of it, his\\n style was often described as being machinelike....\" For a moment Doc\\'s\\n eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. \"But no, the idea is\\n impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three\\n games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately\\n and has grandmaster skill.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did the Machine beat him?\" Sandra asked.\\nDoc shrugged. \"The scores weren\\'t released. It was very hush-hush.\\n But about your idea, Miss Grayling—did you ever read about Maelzel\\'s\\n famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was\\n supposed to work by machinery \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mcogs and gears, not electricity\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m but\\n actually it had a man hidden inside it—your Edgar Poe exposed the\\n fraud in a famous article. In\\nmy\\nstory I think the chess robot will\\n break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser\\n and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up\\n and swing the deal. Only the millionaire\\'s daughter, who is really a\\n better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce\\n too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr\\n kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear\\n when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find\\n yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle\\n its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can\\n imagine....\"\\n\\n\\n While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess\\n stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort\\n evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical\\n doctor. She\\'d read something about two or three coming over with the\\n Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn\\'t sound like a Soviet citizen.\\n\\n\\n He was older than she\\'d first assumed. She could see that now that\\n she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.\\n Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old\\n guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she\\'d been sure she was going to muff\\n this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the\\n umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought\\n that she wasn\\'t a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used\\n dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32myoung,\\n old, American, Russian\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m and pick his brain....\\n\\n\\n She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.\\n\\n\\n Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at\\n them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed\\n position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on\\n four of them, including the Machine\\'s. The central space between\\n the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man\\n hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost\\n tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials.\\nLike morticians\\'\\n assistants\\n, she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at\\n the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,\\n his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if\\n she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.\\n\\n\\n The official laid a hand on Doc\\'s shoulder. \"Sir!\" he said agitatedly.\\n \"Do you realize that they\\'ve started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Giles made the expected\\n comments, smiled the proper\\n smiles and greeted his staff by\\n the right names, but it was purely\\n automatic. Somehow, thinking\\n had grown difficult in the mornings\\n recently.\\nInside his private office, he\\n dropped all pretense and slumped\\n into the padding of his chair, gasping\\n for breath and feeling his\\n heart hammering in his chest.\\n He’d been a fool to come to work,\\n he realized. But with the Procyon\\n shuttle arriving yesterday, there\\n was no telling what might turn\\n up. Besides, that fool of a medicist\\n had sworn the shot would\\n cure any allergy or asthma.\\nGiles heard his secretary come\\n in, but it wasn’t until the smell\\n of the coffee reached his nose\\n that he looked up. She handed\\n him a filled cup and set the carafe\\n down on the age-polished surface\\n of the big desk. She watched\\n solicitously as he drank.\\n“That bad, Arthur?” she asked.\\n“Just a little tired,” he told\\n her, refilling the cup. She’d made\\n the coffee stronger than usual\\n and it seemed to cut through\\n some of the thickness in his head.\\n “I guess I’m getting old, Amanda.”\\nShe smiled dutifully at the\\n time-worn joke, but he knew she\\n wasn’t fooled. She’d cycled to\\n middle age four times in her\\n job and she probably knew him\\n better than he knew himself—which\\n wouldn’t be hard, he\\n thought. He’d hardly recognized\\n the stranger in the mirror as he\\n tried to shave. His normal thinness\\n had looked almost gaunt\\n and there were hollows in his\\n face and circles under his eyes.\\n Even his hair had seemed thinner,\\n though that, of course, was\\n impossible.\\n“Anything urgent on the Procyon\\n shuttle?” he asked as she\\n continue staring at him with worried\\n eyes.\\nSHE JERKED her gaze away\\n guiltily and turned to the incoming\\n basket. “Mostly drugs for\\n experimenting. A personal letter\\n for you, relayed from some place\\n I never heard of. And one of the\\n super-light missiles! They found\\n it drifting half a light-year out\\n and captured it. Jordan’s got a\\n report on it and he’s going crazy.\\n But if you don’t feel well—”\\n“I’m all right!” he told her\\n sharply. Then he steadied himself\\n and managed to smile. “Thanks\\n for the coffee, Amanda.”\\nShe accepted dismissal reluctantly.\\n When she was gone, he\\n sat gazing at the report from Jordan\\n at Research.\\nFor eighty years now, they’d\\n been sending out the little ships\\n that vanished at greater than the\\n speed of light, equipped with\\n every conceivable device to make\\n them return automatically after\\n taking pictures of wherever they\\n arrived. So far, none had ever returned\\n or been located. This was\\n the first hope they’d found that\\n the century-long trips between\\n stars in the ponderous shuttles\\n might be ended and he should\\n have been filled with excitement\\n at Jordan’s hasty preliminary report.\\nHe leafed through it. The little\\n ship apparently had been picked\\n up by accident when it almost\\n collided with a Sirius-local ship.\\n Scientists there had puzzled over\\n it, reset it and sent it back. The\\n two white rats on it had still been\\n alive.\\nGiles dropped the report wearily\\n and picked up the personal\\n message that had come on the\\n shuttle. He fingered the microstrip\\n inside while he drank another\\n coffee, and finally pulled\\n out the microviewer. There were\\n three frames to the message, he\\n saw with some surprise.\\nHe didn’t need to see the signature\\n on the first projection.\\n Only his youngest son would have\\n sent an elaborate tercentenary\\n greeting verse—one that would\\n arrive ninety years too late! Harry\\n had been born just before Earth\\n passed the drastic birth limitation\\n act and his mother had\\n spoiled him. He’d even tried to\\n avoid the compulsory emigration\\n draft and stay on with his mother.\\n It had been the bitter quarrels\\n over that which had finally\\n broken Giles’ fifth marriage.\\nOddly enough, the message in\\n the next frame showed none of\\n that. Harry had nothing but\\n praise for the solar system where\\n he’d been sent. He barely mentioned\\n being married on the way\\n or his dozen children, but filled\\n most of the frame with glowing\\n description and a plea for his\\n father to join him there!\\nGILES SNORTED and turned\\n to the third frame, which\\n showed a group picture of the\\n family in some sort of vehicle,\\n against the background of an alien\\n but attractive world.\\nHe had no desire to spend\\n ninety years cooped up with a\\n bunch of callow young emigrants,\\n even in one of the improved Exodus\\n shuttles. And even if Exodus\\n ever got the super-light\\n drive working, there was no reason\\n he should give up his work.\\n The discovery that men could\\n live practically forever had put\\n an end to most family ties; sentiment\\n wore thin in half a century—which\\n wasn’t much time\\n now, though it had once seemed\\n long enough.\\nStrange how the years seemed\\n to get shorter as their number increased.\\n There’d been a song\\n once—something about the years\\n dwindling down. He groped for\\n the lines and couldn’t remember.\\n Drat it! Now he’d probably lie\\n awake most of the night again,\\n trying to recall them.\\nThe outside line buzzed musically,\\n flashing Research’s number.\\n Giles grunted in irritation. He\\n wasn’t ready to face Jordan yet.\\n But he shrugged and pressed the\\n button.\\nThe intense face that looked\\n from the screen was frowning as\\n Jordan’s eyes seemed to sweep\\n around the room. He was still\\n young—one of the few under\\n a hundred who’d escaped deportation\\n because of special ability—and\\n patience was still foreign to\\n him.\\nThen the frown vanished as\\n an expression of shock replaced\\n it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.\\n If he looked\\nthat\\nbad—\\nBut Jordan wasn’t looking at\\n him; the man’s interest lay in the\\n projected picture from Harry, across\\n the desk from the communicator.\\n“Antigravity!” His voice was\\n unbelieving as he turned his head\\n to face the older man. “What\\n world is that?”\\nGiles forced his attention on\\n the picture again and this time\\n he noticed the vehicle shown. It\\n was enough like an old model\\n Earth conveyance to pass casual\\n inspection, but it floated wheellessly\\n above the ground. Faint\\n blur lines indicated it had been\\n moving when the picture was\\n taken.\\n“One of my sons—” Giles\\n started to answer. “I could find\\n the star’s designation....”\\nJordan cursed harshly. “So we\\n can send a message on the shuttle,\\n begging for their secret in a\\n couple of hundred years! While\\n a hundred other worlds make a\\n thousand major discoveries they\\n don’t bother reporting! Can’t the\\n Council see\\nanything\\n?”\\nGiles had heard it all before.\\n Earth was becoming a backwater\\n world; no real progress had been\\n made in two centuries; the young\\n men were sent out as soon as\\n their first fifty years of education\\n were finished, and the older men\\n were too conservative for really\\n new thinking. There was a measure\\n of truth in it, unfortunately.\\n“They’ll slow up when their\\n populations fill,” Giles repeated\\n his old answers. “We’re still ahead\\n in medicine and we’ll get the\\n other discoveries eventually, without\\n interrupting the work of making\\n the Earth fit for our longevity.\\n We can wait. We’ll have to.”\\nTHE YOUNGER man stared\\n at him with the strange puzzled\\n look Giles had seen too often\\n lately. “Damn it, haven’t you read\\n my report? We know the super-light\\n drive works! That missile\\n reached Sirius in less than ten\\n days. We can have the secret of\\n this antigravity in less than a\\n year! We—”\\n“Wait a minute.” Giles felt the\\n thickness pushing back at his\\n mind and tried to fight it off. He’d\\n only skimmed the report, but this\\n made no sense. “You mean you\\n can calibrate your guiding devices\\n accurately enough to get a\\n missile where you want it and\\n back?”\\n“\\nWhat?\\n” Jordan’s voice rattled\\n the speaker. “Of course not! It\\n took two accidents to get the\\n thing back to us—and with a\\n half-light-year miss that delayed\\n it about twenty years before the\\n Procyon shuttle heard its signal.\\n Pre-setting a course may take\\n centuries, if we can ever master\\n it. Even with Sirius expecting the\\n missiles and ready to cooperate.\\n I mean the big ship. We’ve had it\\n drafted for building long enough;\\n now we can finish it in three\\n months. We know the drive works.\\n We know it’s fast enough to reach\\n Procyon in two weeks. We even\\n know life can stand the trip. The\\n rats were unharmed.”\\nGiles shook his head at what\\n the other was proposing, only\\n partly believing it. “Rats don’t\\n have minds that could show any\\n real damage such as the loss of\\n power to rejuvenate. We can’t put\\n human pilots into a ship with our\\n drive until we’ve tested it more\\n thoroughly, Bill, even if they\\n could correct for errors on arrival.\\n Maybe if we put in stronger signaling\\n transmitters....”\\n“Yeah. Maybe in two centuries\\n we’d have a through route charted\\n to Sirius. And we still wouldn’t\\n have proved it safe for human\\n pilots. Mr. Giles, we’ve got to\\n have the big ship. All we need is\\none\\nvolunteer!”\\nIt occurred to Giles then that\\n the man had been too fired with\\n the idea to think. He leaned back,\\n shaking his head again wearily.\\n “All right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.\\n Or how about you? Do\\n you really want to risk losing the\\n rest of your life rather than waiting\\n a couple more centuries until\\n we know it’s safe? If you do, I’ll\\n order the big ship.”\\nJordan opened his mouth and\\n for a second Giles’ heart caught\\n in a flux of emotions as the\\n man’s offer hovered on his lips.\\n Then the engineer shut his mouth\\n slowly. The belligerence ran out\\n of him.\\nHe looked sick, for he had no\\n answer.\\nNO SANE man would risk a\\n chance for near eternity\\n against such a relatively short\\n wait. Heroism had belonged to\\n those who knew their days were\\n numbered, anyhow.\\n“Forget it, Bill,” Giles advised.\\n “It may take longer, but eventually\\n we’ll find a way. With time\\n enough, we’re bound to. And\\n when we do, the ship will be\\n ready.”\\nThe engineer nodded miserably\\n and clicked off. Giles turned\\n from the blank screen to stare\\n out of the windows, while his\\n hand came up to twist at the lock\\n of hair over his forehead. Eternity!\\n They had to plan and build\\n for it. They couldn’t risk that\\n plan for short-term benefits. Usually\\n it was too easy to realize that,\\n and the sight of the solid, time-enduring\\n buildings outside should\\n have given him a sense of security.\\nToday, though, nothing seemed\\n to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\\n somehow lost; the city beyond\\n the window blurred as he\\n studied it, and he swung the chair\\n back so violently that his hand\\n jerked painfully on the forelock\\n he’d been twisting.\\nThen he was staring unbelievingly\\n at the single white hair that\\n was twisted with the dark ones\\n between his fingers.\\nLike an automaton, he bent\\n forward, his other hand groping\\n for the mirror that should be in\\n one of the drawers. The dull pain\\n in his chest sharpened and his\\n breath was hoarse in his throat,\\n but he hardly noticed as he found\\n the mirror and brought it up. His\\n eyes focused reluctantly. There\\n were other white strands in his\\n dark hair.\\nThe mirror crashed to the floor\\n as he staggered out of the office.\\nIt was only two blocks to Giles’\\n residence club, but he had to\\n stop twice to catch his breath\\n and fight against the pain that\\n clawed at his chest. When he\\n reached the wood-paneled lobby,\\n he was barely able to stand.\\nDubbins was at his side almost\\n at once, with a hand under\\n his arm to guide him toward his\\n suite.\\n“Let me help you, sir,” Dubbins\\n suggested, in the tones\\n Giles hadn’t heard since the man\\n had been his valet, back when\\n it was still possible to find personal\\n servants. Now he managed\\n the club on a level of quasi-equality\\n with the members. For the\\n moment, though, he’d slipped\\n back into the old ways.\\nGILES FOUND himself lying\\n on his couch, partially undressed,\\n with the pillows just right\\n and a long drink in his hand. The\\n alcohol combined with the reaction\\n from his panic to leave him\\n almost himself again. After all,\\n there was nothing to worry about;\\n Earth’s doctors could cure anything.\\n“I guess you’d better call Dr.\\n Vincenti,” he decided. Vincenti\\n was a member and would probably\\n be the quickest to get.\\nDubbins shook his head. “Dr.\\n Vincenti isn’t with us, sir. He\\n left a year ago to visit a son in\\n the Centauri system. There’s a\\n Dr. Cobb whose reputation is\\n very good, sir.”\\nGiles puzzled over it doubtfully.\\n Vincenti had been an oddly\\n morose man the last few times\\n he’d seen him, but that could\\n hardly explain his taking a twenty-year\\n shuttle trip for such a\\n slim reason. It was no concern of\\n his, though. “Dr. Cobb, then,” he\\n said.\\nGiles heard the other man’s\\n voice on the study phone, too low\\n for the words to be distinguishable.\\n He finished the drink, feeling\\n still better, and was sitting\\n up when Dubbins came back.\\n“Dr. Cobb wants you to come\\n to his office at once, sir,” he said,\\n dropping to his knee to help\\n Giles with his shoes. “I’d be\\n pleased to drive you there.”\\nGiles frowned. He’d expected\\n Cobb to come to him. Then he\\n grimaced at his own thoughts.\\n Dubbins’ manners must have carried\\n him back into the past; doctors\\n didn’t go in for home visits\\n now—they preferred to see their\\n patients in the laboratories that\\n housed their offices. If this kept\\n on, he’d be missing the old days\\n when he’d had a mansion and\\n counted his wealth in possessions,\\n instead of the treasures he could\\n build inside himself for the future\\n ahead. He was getting positively\\n childish!\\nYet he relished the feeling of\\n having Dubbins drive his car.\\n More than anything else, he’d\\n loved being driven. Even after\\n chauffeurs were a thing of the\\n past, Harry had driven him\\n around. Now he’d taken to walking,\\n as so many others had, for\\n even with modern safety measures\\n so strict, there was always\\n a small chance of some accident\\n and nobody had any desire to\\n spend the long future as a cripple.\\n“I’ll wait for you, sir,” Dubbins\\n offered as they stopped beside\\n the low, massive medical building.\\nIt was almost too much consideration.\\n Giles nodded, got out\\n and headed down the hall uncertainly.\\n Just how bad did he\\n look? Well, he’d soon find out.\\nHe located the directory and\\n finally found the right office, its\\n reception room wall covered\\n with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had\\n picked up in some three hundred\\n years of practice. Giles felt\\n better, realizing it wouldn’t be\\n one of the younger men.\\nCOBB APPEARED himself,\\n before the nurse could take\\n over, and led Giles into a room\\n with an old-fashioned desk and\\n chairs that almost concealed the\\n cabinets of equipment beyond.\\nHe listened as Giles stumbled\\n out his story. Halfway through,\\n the nurse took a blood sample\\n with one of the little mosquito\\n needles and the machinery behind\\n the doctor began working on\\n it.\\n“Your friend told me about the\\n gray hair, of course,” Cobb said.\\n At Giles’ look, he smiled faintly.\\n “Surely you didn’t think people\\n could miss that in this day and\\n age? Let’s see it.”\\nHe inspected it and began\\n making tests. Some were older\\n than Giles could remember—knee\\n reflex, blood pressure, pulse\\n and fluoroscope. Others involved\\n complicated little gadgets that\\n ran over his body, while meters\\n bobbed and wiggled. The blood\\n check came through and Cobb\\n studied it, to go back and make\\n further inspections of his own.\\nAt last he nodded slowly.\\n “Hyper-catabolism, of course. I\\n thought it might be. How long\\n since you had your last rejuvenation?\\n And who gave it?”\\n“About ten years ago,” Giles\\n answered. He found his identity\\n card and passed it over, while\\n the doctor studied it. “My sixteenth.”\\nIt wasn’t going right. He could\\n feel it. Some of the panic symptoms\\n were returning; the pulse in\\n his neck was pounding and his\\n breath was growing difficult.\\n Sweat ran down his sides from\\n his armpit and he wiped his palms\\n against his coat.\\n“Any particular emotional\\n strain when you were treated—some\\n major upset in your life?”\\n Cobb asked.\\nGiles thought as carefully as\\n he could, but he remembered\\n nothing like that. “You mean—it\\n didn’t take? But I never had\\n any trouble, Doctor. I was one of\\n the first million cases, when a\\n lot of people couldn’t rejuvenate\\n at all, and I had no trouble even\\n then.”\\nCobb considered it, hesitated as\\n if making up his mind to be frank\\n against his better judgment. “I\\n can’t see any other explanation.\\n You’ve got a slight case of angina—nothing\\n serious, but quite definite—as\\n well as other signs\\n of aging. I’m afraid the treatment\\n didn’t take fully. It might have\\n been some unconscious block\\n on your part, some infection not\\n diagnosed at the time, or even a\\n fault in the treatment. That’s\\n pretty rare, but we can’t neglect\\n the possibility.”\\nHE STUDIED his charts again\\n and then smiled. “So we’ll\\n give you another treatment. Any\\n reason you can’t begin immediately?”\\nGiles remembered that Dubbins\\n was waiting for him, but this\\n was more important. It hadn’t\\n been a joke about his growing old,\\n after all. But now, in a few days,\\n he’d be his old—no, of course\\n not—his young self again!\\nThey went down the hall to\\n another office, where Giles waited\\n outside while Cobb conferred\\n with another doctor and technician,\\n with much waving of charts.\\n He resented every second of it.\\n It was as if the almost forgotten\\n specter of age stood beside him,\\n counting the seconds. But at last\\n they were through and he was led\\n into the quiet rejuvenation room,\\n where the clamps were adjusted\\n about his head and the earpieces\\n were fitted. The drugs were shot\\n painlessly into his arm and the\\n light-pulser was adjusted to his\\n brain-wave pattern.\\nIt had been nothing like this his\\n first time. Then it had required\\n months of mental training, followed\\n by crude mechanical and\\n drug hypnosis for other months.\\n Somewhere in every human brain\\n lay the memory of what his cells\\n had been like when he was young.\\n Or perhaps it lay in the cells\\n themselves, with the brain as only\\n a linkage to it. They’d discovered\\n that, and the fact that the mind\\n could effect physical changes in\\n the body. Even such things as\\n cancer could be willed out of existence—provided\\n the brain\\n could be reached far below the\\n conscious level and forced to\\n operate.\\nThere had been impossible\\n faith cures for millenia—cataracts\\n removed from blinded eyes\\n within minutes, even—but finding\\n the mechanism in the brain\\n that worked those miracles had\\n taken an incredible amount of\\n study and finding a means of\\n bringing it under control had\\n taken even longer.\\nNow they did it with dozens of\\n mechanical aids in addition to\\n the hypnotic instructions—and\\n did it usually in a single sitting,\\n with the full transformation of\\n the body taking less than a week\\n after the treatment!\\nBut with all the equipment, it\\n wasn’t impossible for a mistake\\n to happen. It had been no fault of\\n his ... he was sure of that ... his\\n mind was easy to reach ... he\\n could relax so easily....\\nHe came out of it without\\n even a headache, while they were\\n removing the probes, but the\\n fatigue on the operator’s face told\\n him it had been a long and difficult\\n job. He stretched experimentally,\\n with the eternal unconscious\\n expectation that he would\\n find himself suddenly young\\n again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.\\n It took days for the mind\\n to work on all the cells and to\\n repair the damage of time.\\nCOBB LED him back to the\\n first office, where he was given\\n an injection of some kind and\\n another sample of his blood was\\n taken, while the earlier tests were\\n repeated. But finally the doctor\\n nodded.\\n“That’s all for now, Mr. Giles.\\n You might drop in tomorrow\\n morning, after I’ve had a chance\\n to complete my study of all this.\\n We’ll know by then whether you’ll\\n need more treatment. Ten o’clock\\n okay?”\\n“But I’ll be all right?”\\nCobb smiled the automatic reassurance\\n of his profession. “We\\n haven’t lost a patient in two hundred\\n years, to my knowledge.”\\n“Thanks,” said Giles. “Ten\\n o’clock is fine.”\\nDubbins was still waiting, reading\\n a paper whose headlined feature\\n carried a glowing account of\\n the discovery of the super-light\\n missile and what it might mean.\\n He took a quick look at Giles and\\n pointed to it. “Great work, Mr.\\n Giles. Maybe we’ll all get to see\\n some of those other worlds yet.”\\n Then he studied Giles more carefully.\\n “Everything’s in good shape\\n now, sir?”\\n“The doctor says everything’s\\n going to be fine,” Giles answered.\\nIt was then he realized for the\\n first time that Cobb had said no\\n such thing. A statement that\\n lightning had never struck a\\n house was no guarantee that it\\n never would. It was an evasion\\n meant to give such an impression.\\nThe worry nagged at him all\\n the way back. Word had already\\n gone around the club that he’d\\n had some kind of attack and\\n there were endless questions that\\n kept it on his mind. And even\\n when it had been covered and\\n recovered, he could still sense the\\n glances of the others, as if he\\n were Vincenti in one of the man’s\\n more morose moods.\\nHe found a single table in the\\n dining room and picked his way\\n through the meal, listening to\\n the conversation about him only\\n when it was necessary because\\n someone called across to him.\\n Ordinarily, he was quick to support\\n the idea of clubs in place\\n of private families. A man here\\n could choose his group and grow\\n into them. Yet he wasn’t swallowed\\n by them, as he might be by\\n a family. Giles had been living\\n here for nearly a century now and\\n he’d never regretted it. But tonight\\n his own group irritated him.\\nHe puzzled over it, finding no\\n real reason. Certainly they weren’t\\n forcing themselves on him. He\\n remembered once when he’d had\\n a cold, before they finally licked\\n that; Harry had been a complete\\n nuisance, running around with\\n various nostrums, giving him no\\n peace. Constant questions about\\n how he felt, constant little looks\\n of worry—until he’d been ready\\n to yell at the boy. In fact, he\\n had.\\nFunny, he couldn’t picture really\\n losing his temper here. Families\\n did odd things to a man.\\nHE LISTENED to a few of\\n the discussions after the dinner,\\n but he’d heard them all before,\\n except for one about the\\n super-speed drive, and there he\\n had no wish to talk until he could\\n study the final report. He gave up\\n at last and went to his own suite.\\n What he needed was a good\\n night’s sleep after a little relaxation.\\nEven that failed him, though.\\n He’d developed one of the finest\\n chess collections in the world, but\\n tonight it held no interest. And\\n when he drew out his tools and\\n tried working on the delicate,\\n lovely jade for the set he was\\n carving his hands seemed to be\\n all thumbs. None of the other interests\\n he’d developed through\\n the years helped to add to the\\n richness of living now.\\nHe gave it up and went to bed—to\\n have the fragment of that\\n song pop into his head. Now there\\n was no escaping it. Something\\n about the years—or was it days—dwindling\\n down to something\\n or other.\\nCould they really dwindle\\n down? Suppose he couldn’t rejuvenate\\n all the way? He knew\\n that there were some people who\\n didn’t respond as well as others.\\n Sol Graves, for instance. He’d\\n been fifty when he finally learned\\n how to work with the doctors and\\n they could only bring him back to\\n about thirty, instead of the normal\\n early twenties. Would that\\n reduce the slice of eternity that\\n rejuvenation meant? And what\\n had happened to Sol?\\nOr suppose it wasn’t rejuvenation,\\n after all; suppose something\\n had gone wrong with him\\n permanently?\\nHe fought that off, but he\\n couldn’t escape the nagging\\n doubts at the doctor’s words.\\nHe got up once to stare at himself\\n in the mirror. Ten hours had\\n gone by and there should have\\n been some signs of improvement.\\n He couldn’t be sure, though,\\n whether there were or not.\\nHe looked no better the next\\n morning when he finally dragged\\n himself up from the little sleep\\n he’d managed to get. The hollows\\n were still there and the circles\\n under his eyes. He searched for\\n the gray in his hair, but the traitorous\\n strands had been removed\\n at the doctor’s office and he could\\n find no new ones.\\nHe looked into the dining room\\n and then went by hastily. He\\n wanted no solicitous glances this\\n morning. Drat it, maybe he\\n should move out. Maybe trying\\n family life again would give him\\n some new interests. Amanda probably\\n would be willing to marry\\n him; she’d hinted at a date once.\\nHe stopped, shocked by the\\n awareness that he hadn’t been out\\n with a woman for....\\nHe couldn’t remember how\\n long it had been. Nor why.\\n“In the spring, a young man’s\\n fancy,” he quoted to himself, and\\n then shuddered.\\nIt hadn’t been that kind of\\n spring for him—not this rejuvenation\\n nor the last, nor the one\\n before that.\\nGILES TRIED to stop scaring\\n himself and partially succeeded,\\n until he reached the doctor’s\\n office. Then it was no longer necessary\\n to frighten himself. The\\n wrongness was too strong, no matter\\n how professional Cobb’s smile!\\nHe didn’t hear the preliminary\\n words. He watched the smile vanish\\n as the stack of reports came\\n out. There was no nurse here\\n now. The machines were quiet—and\\n all the doors were shut.\\nGiles shook his head, interrupting\\n the doctor’s technical jargon.\\n Now that he knew there was reason\\n for his fear, it seemed to\\n vanish, leaving a coldness that\\n numbed him.\\n“I’d rather know the whole\\n truth,” he said. His voice sounded\\n dead in his ears. “The worst first.\\n The rejuvenation...?”\\nCobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.\\n “Failed.” He stopped, and\\n his hands touched the reports on\\n his desk. “Completely,” he added\\n in a low, defeated tone.\\n“But I thought that was impossible!”\\n“So did I. I wouldn’t believe\\n it even yet—but now I find it\\n isn’t the first case. I spent the\\n night at Medical Center going up\\n the ranks until I found men who\\n really know about it. And now I\\n wish I hadn’t.” His voice ran\\n down and he gathered himself together\\n by an effort. “It’s a shock\\n to me, too, Mr. Giles. But—well,\\n to simplify it, no memory is perfect—even\\n cellular memory. It\\n loses a little each time. And the\\n effect is cumulative. It’s like an\\n asymptotic curve—the further it\\n goes, the steeper the curve. And—well,\\n you’ve passed too far.”\\nHe faced away from Giles,\\n dropping the reports into a\\n drawer and locking it. “I wasn’t\\n supposed to tell you, of course.\\n It’s going to be tough enough\\n when they’re ready to let people\\n know. But you aren’t the first and\\n you won’t be the last, if that’s any\\n consolation. We’ve got a longer\\n time scale than we used to have—but\\n it’s in centuries, not in\\n eons. For everybody, not just\\n you.”\\nIt was no consolation. Giles\\n nodded mechanically. “I won’t\\n talk, of course. How—how long?”\\nCobb spread his hands unhappily.\\n “Thirty years, maybe. But\\n we can make them better. Geriatric\\n knowledge is still on record.\\n We can fix the heart and all the\\n rest. You’ll be in good physical\\n condition, better than your grandfather—”\\n“And then....” Giles couldn’t\\n pronounce the words. He’d grown\\n old and he’d grow older. And\\n eventually he’d die!\\nAn immortal man had suddenly\\n found death hovering on his\\n trail. The years had dwindled and\\n gone, and only a few were left.\\nHe stood up, holding out his\\n hand. “Thank you, Doctor,” he\\n said, and was surprised to find\\n he meant it. The man had done\\n all he could and had at least\\n saved him the suspense of growing\\n doubt and horrible eventual\\n discovery.\\nOUTSIDE ON the street, he\\n looked up at the Sun and\\n then at the buildings built to last\\n for thousands of years. Their\\n eternity was no longer a part of\\n him.\\nEven his car would outlast him.\\nHe climbed into it, still partly\\n numbed, and began driving mechanically,\\n no longer wondering\\n about the dangers that might possibly\\n arise. Those wouldn’t matter\\n much now. For a man who\\n had thought of living almost forever,\\n thirty years was too short\\n a time to count.\\nHe was passing near the club\\n and started to slow. Then he\\n went on without stopping. He\\n wanted no chance to have them\\n asking questions he couldn’t answer.\\n It was none of their business.\\n Dubbins had been kind—but\\n now Giles wanted no kindness.\\nThe street led to the office\\n and he drove on. What else was\\n there for him? There, at least, he\\n could still fill his time with work—work\\n that might even be useful.\\n In the future, men would\\n need the super-light drive if they\\n were to span much more of the\\n Universe than now. And he could\\n speed up the work in some ways\\n still, even if he could never see\\n its finish.\\nIt would be cold comfort but it\\n was something. And he might\\n keep busy enough to forget sometimes\\n that the years were gone\\n for him.\\nAutomatic habit carried him\\n through the office again, to Amanda’s\\n desk, where her worry was\\n still riding her. He managed a\\n grin and somehow the right words\\n came to his lips. “I saw the doctor,\\n Amanda, so you can stop\\n figuring ways to get me there.”\\nShe smiled back suddenly, without\\n feigning it. “Then you’re all\\n right?”\\n“As all right as I’ll ever be,”\\n he told her. “They tell me I’m just\\n growing old.”\\nThis time her laugh was heartier.\\n He caught himself before he\\n could echo her mirth in a different\\n voice and went inside where she\\n had the coffee waiting for him.\\nOddly, it still tasted good to\\n him.\\nThe projection was off, he saw,\\n wondering whether he’d left it on\\n or not. He snapped the switch and\\n saw the screen light up, with the\\n people still in the odd, wheelless\\n vehicle on the alien planet.\\nFOR A long moment, he stared\\n at the picture without thinking,\\n and then bent closer. Harry’s\\n face hadn’t changed much. Giles\\n had almost forgotten it, but there\\n was still the same grin there. And\\n his grandchildren had a touch\\n of it, too. And of their grandfather’s\\n nose, he thought. Funny,\\n he’d never seen even pictures of\\n his other grandchildren. Family\\n ties melted away too fast for interstellar\\n travel.\\nYet there seemed to be no\\n slackening of them in Harry’s\\n case, and somehow it looked like\\n a family, rather than a mere\\n group. A very pleasant family in\\n a very pleasant world.\\nHe read Harry’s note again,\\n with its praise for the planet and\\n its invitation. He wondered if\\n Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation\\n like that, before he left.\\n Or had he even been one of those\\n to whom the same report had\\n been delivered by some doctor?\\n It didn’t matter, but it would explain\\n things, at least.\\nTwenty years to Centaurus,\\n while the years dwindled down—\\nThen abruptly the line finished\\n itself. “The years dwindle down\\n to a precious few....” he remembered.\\n “A precious few.”\\nThose dwindling years had\\n been precious once. He unexpectedly\\n recalled his own grandfather\\n holding him on an old\\n knee and slipping him candy\\n that was forbidden. The years\\n seemed precious to the old man\\n then.\\nAmanda’s voice came abruptly\\n over the intercom. “Jordan wants\\n to talk to you,” she said, and the\\n irritation was sharp in her voice.\\n “He won’t take no!”\\nGiles shrugged and reached for\\n the projector, to cut it off. Then,\\n on impulse, he set it back to the\\n picture, studying the group again\\n as he switched on Jordan’s wire.\\nBut he didn’t wait for the hot\\n words about whatever was the\\n trouble.\\n“Bill,” he said, “start getting\\n the big ship into production. I’ve\\n found a volunteer.”\\nHe’d been driven to it, he knew,\\n as he watched the man’s amazed\\n face snap from the screen. From\\n the first suspicion of his trouble,\\n something inside him had been\\n forcing him to make this decision.\\n And maybe it would do no good.\\n Maybe the ship would fail. But\\n thirty years was a number a man\\n could risk.\\nIf he made it, though....\\nWell, he’d see those grandchildren\\n of his this year—and\\n Harry. Maybe he’d even tell\\n Harry the truth, once they got\\n done celebrating the reunion. And\\n there’d be other grandchildren.\\n With the ship, he’d have time\\n enough to look them up. Plenty\\n of time!\\nThirty years was a long time,\\n when he stopped to think of it.\\n—LESTER DEL REY\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

That was when I did it.\\n\\n\\n Why couldn\\'t what he said have been \"The best things in life are free,\\n buddy\" or \"Every dog has his day, fellow\" or \"If at first you don\\'t\\n succeed, man\"? No, he had to use that one line. You wouldn\\'t blame me.\\n Not if you believe me.\\n\\n\\n The first thing I can remember, the start of all this, was when I was\\n four or five somebody was soiling my bed for me. I absolutely was not\\n doing it. I took long naps morning and evening so I could lie awake all\\n night to see that it wouldn\\'t happen. It couldn\\'t happen. But in the\\n morning the bed would sit there dispassionately soiled and convict me\\n on circumstantial evidence. My punishment was as sure as the tide.\\n\\n\\n Dad was a compact man, small eyes, small mouth, tight clothes. He was\\n narrow but not mean. For punishment, he locked me in a windowless\\n room and told me to sit still until he came back. It wasn\\'t so bad a\\n punishment, except that when Dad closed the door, the light turned off\\n and I was left there in the dark.\\n\\n\\n Being four or five, I didn\\'t know any better, so I thought Dad made it\\n dark to add to my punishment. But I learned he didn\\'t know the light\\n went out. It came back on when he unlocked the door. Every time I told\\n him about the light as soon as I could talk again, but he said I was\\n lying.\\nOne day, to prove me a liar, he opened and closed the door a few times\\n from outside. The light winked off and on, off and on, always shining\\n when Dad stuck his head inside. He tried using the door from the\\n inside, and the light stayed on, no matter how hard he slammed the\\n door.\\n\\n\\n I stayed in the dark longer for lying about the light.\\n\\n\\n Alone in the dark, I wouldn\\'t have had it so bad if it wasn\\'t for the\\n things that came to me.\\n\\n\\n They were real to me. They never touched me, but they had a little boy.\\n He looked the way I did in the mirror. They did unpleasant things to\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Because they were real, I talked about them as if they were real, and\\n I almost earned a bunk in the home for retarded children until I got\\n smart enough to keep the beasts to myself.\\n\\n\\n My mother hated me. I loved her, of course. I remember her smell mixed\\n up with flowers and cookies and winter fires. I remember she hugged me\\n on my ninth birthday. The trouble came from the notes written in my\\n awkward hand that she found, calling her names I didn\\'t understand.\\n Sometimes there were drawings. I didn\\'t write those notes or make those\\n drawings.\\n\\n\\n My mother and father must have been glad when I was sent away to reform\\n school after my thirteenth birthday party, the one no one came to.\\n\\n\\n The reform school was nicer. There were others there who\\'d had it about\\n like me. We got along. I didn\\'t watch their shifty eyes too much, or\\n ask them what they shifted to see. They didn\\'t talk about my screams\\n at night.\\n\\n\\n It was home.\\n\\n\\n My trouble there was that I was always being framed for stealing. I\\n didn\\'t take any of those things they located in my bunk. Stealing\\n wasn\\'t in my line. If you believe any of this at all, you\\'ll see why it\\n couldn\\'t be me who did the stealing.\\n\\n\\n There was reason for me to steal, if I could have got away with it. The\\n others got money from home to buy the things they needed—razor blades,\\n candy, sticks of tea. I got a letter from Mom or Dad every now and then\\n before they were killed, saying they had sent money or that it was\\n enclosed, but somehow I never got a dime of it.\\n\\n\\n When I was expelled from reform school, I left with just one idea in\\n mind—to get all the money I could ever use for the things I needed and\\n the things I wanted.\\nIt was two or three years later that I skulked into Brother Partridge\\'s\\n mission on Durbin Street.\\n\\n\\n The preacher and half a dozen men were singing\\nOnward Christian\\n Soldiers\\nin the meeting room. It was a drafty hall with varnished\\n camp chairs. I shuffled in at the back with my suitcoat collar turned\\n up around my stubbled jaw. I made my hand shaky as I ran it through my\\n knotted hair. Partridge was supposed to think I was just a bum. As\\n an inspiration, I hugged my chest to make him think I was some wino\\n nursing a flask full of Sneaky Pete. All I had there was a piece of\\n copper alloy tubing inside a slice of plastic hose for taking care of\\n myself, rolling sailors and the like. Who had the price of a bottle?\\nPartridge didn\\'t seem to notice me, but I knew that was an act. I knew\\n people were always watching every move I made. He braced his red-furred\\n hands on the sides of his auctioneer\\'s stand and leaned his splotched\\n eagle beak toward us. \"Brothers, this being Thanksgiving, I pray the\\n good Lord that we all are truly thankful for all that we have received.\\n Amen.\"\\n\\n\\n Some skin-and-bones character I didn\\'t know struggled out of his seat,\\n amening. I could see he had a lot to be thankful for—somewhere he had\\n received a fix.\\n\\n\\n \"Brothers,\" Partridge went on after enjoying the interruption with a\\n beaming smile, \"you shall all be entitled to a bowl of turkey soup\\n prepared by Sister Partridge, a generous supply of sweet rolls and\\n dinner rolls contributed by the Early Morning Bakery of this city,\\n and all the coffee you can drink. Let us march out to\\nThe Stars and\\n Stripes Forever\\n, John Philip Sousa\\'s grand old patriotic song.\"\\n\\n\\n I had to laugh at all those bums clattering the chairs in front of me,\\n scampering after water soup and stale bread. As soon as I got cleaned\\n up, I was going to have dinner in a good restaurant, and I was going to\\n order such expensive food and leave such a large tip for the waiter and\\n send one to the chef that they were going to think I was rich, and some\\n executive with some brokerage firm would see me and say to himself,\\n \"Hmm, executive material. Just the type we need. I beg your pardon,\\n sir—\" just like the razor-blade comic-strip ads in the old magazines\\n that Frankie the Pig sells three for a quarter.\\n\\n\\n I was marching. Man, was I ever marching, but the secret of it was I\\n was only marking time the way we did in fire drills at the school.\\n\\n\\n They passed me, every one of them, and marched out of the meeting\\n room into the kitchen. Even Partridge made his way down from the\\n auctioneer\\'s stand like a vulture with a busted wing and darted through\\n his private door.\\n\\n\\n I was alone, marking time behind the closed half of double doors. One\\n good breath and I raced past the open door and flattened myself to the\\n wall. Crockery was ringing and men were slurping inside. No one had\\n paid any attention to me. That was pretty odd. People usually watch my\\n every move, but a man\\'s luck has to change sometime, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\n Following the wallboard, I went down the side of the room and behind\\n the last row of chairs, closer, closer, and halfway up the room again\\n to the entrance—the entrance and the little wooden box fastened to the\\n wall beside it.\\n\\n\\n The box was old and made out of some varnished wood. There was a slot\\n in the top. There wasn\\'t any sign anywhere around it, but you knew it\\n wasn\\'t a mailbox.\\n\\n\\n My hand went flat on the top of the box. One finger at a time drew up\\n and slipped into the slot. Index, fore, third, little. I put my thumb\\n in my palm and shoved. My hand went in.\\n\\n\\n There were coins inside. I scooped them up with two fingers and held\\n them fast with the other two. Once I dropped a dime—not a penny,\\n milled edge—and I started to reach for it. No, don\\'t be greedy. I knew\\n I would probably lose my hold on all the coins if I tried for that one.\\n I had all the rest. It felt like about two dollars, or close to it.\\n\\n\\n Then I found the bill. A neatly folded bill in the box. Somehow I knew\\n all along it would be there.\\nI tried to read the numbers on the bill with my fingertips, but I\\n couldn\\'t. It had to be a one. Who drops anything but a one into a Skid\\n Row collection box? But still there were tourists, slummers. They might\\n leave a fifty or even a hundred. A hundred!\\n\\n\\n Yes, it felt new, crisp. It had to be a hundred. A single would be\\n creased or worn.\\n\\n\\n I pulled my hand out of the box. I\\ntried\\nto pull my hand out of the\\n box.\\n\\n\\n I knew what the trouble was, of course. I was in a monkey trap. The\\n monkey reaches through the hole for the bait, and when he gets it in\\n his hot little fist, he can\\'t get his hand out. He\\'s too greedy to let\\n go, so he stays there, caught as securely as if he were caged.\\n\\n\\n I was a man, not a monkey. I knew why I couldn\\'t get my hand out. But I\\n couldn\\'t lose that money, especially that century bill. Calm, I ordered\\n myself.\\nCalm.\\nThe box was fastened to the vertical tongue-and-groove laths of the\\n woodwork, not the wall. It was old lumber, stiffened by a hundred\\n layers of paint since 1908. The paint was as thick and strong as the\\n boards. The box was fastened fast. Six-inch spike nails, I guessed.\\n\\n\\n Calmly, I flung my whole weight away from the wall. My wrist almost\\n cracked, but there wasn\\'t even a bend in the box. Carefully, I tried to\\n jerk my fist straight up, to pry off the top of the box. It was as if\\n the box had been carved out of one solid piece of timber. It wouldn\\'t\\n go up, down, left or right.\\n\\n\\n But I kept trying.\\n\\n\\n While keeping a lookout for Partridge and somebody stepping out of the\\n kitchen for a pull on a bottle, I spotted the clock for the first\\n time, a Western Union clock high up at the back of the hall. Just as\\n I seen it for the first time, the electricity wound the spring motor\\n inside like a chicken having its neck wrung.\\n\\n\\n The next time I glanced at the clock, it said ten minutes had gone by.\\n My hand still wasn\\'t free and I hadn\\'t budged the box.\\n\\n\\n \"This,\" Brother Partridge said, \"is one of the most profound\\n experiences of my life.\"\\n\\n\\n My head hinged until it lined my eyes up with Brother Partridge. The\\n pipe hung heavy in my pocket, but he was too far from me.\\n\\n\\n \"A vision of you at the box projected itself on the crest of my soup,\"\\n the preacher explained in wonderment.\\n\\n\\n I nodded. \"Swimming right in there with the dead duck.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Cold turkey,\" he corrected. \"Are you scoffing at a miracle?\"\\n\\n\\n \"People are always watching me, Brother,\" I said. \"So now they do it\\n even when they aren\\'t around. I should have known it would come to\\n that.\"\\n\\n\\n The pipe was suddenly a weight I wanted off me. I would try robbing\\n a collection box, knowing positively that I would get caught, but I\\n wasn\\'t dumb enough to murder. Somebody, somewhere, would be a witness\\n to it. I had never got away with anything in my life. I was too smart\\n to even try anything but the little things.\\n\\n\\n \"I may be able to help you,\" Brother Partridge said, \"if you have faith\\n and a conscience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got something better than a conscience,\" I told him.\\nBrother Partridge regarded me solemnly. \"There must be something\\n special about you, for your apprehension to come through miraculous\\n intervention. But I can\\'t imagine what.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\nalways\\nget apprehended somehow, Brother,\" I said. \"I\\'m pretty\\n special.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"William Hagle.\" No sense lying. I had been booked and printed before.\\n\\n\\n Partridge prodded me with his bony fingers as if making sure I was\\n substantial. \"Come. Let\\'s sit down, if you can remove your fist from\\n the money box.\"\\n\\n\\n I opened up my fingers and let the coins ring inside the box and I drew\\n out my hand. The bill stuck to the sweat on my fingers and slid out\\n along with the digits. A one, I decided. I had got into trouble for a\\n grubby single. It wasn\\'t any century. I had been kidding myself.\\n\\n\\n I unfolded the note. Sure enough, it wasn\\'t a hundred-dollar bill, but\\n it was a twenty, and that was almost the same thing to me. I creased it\\n and put it back into the slot.\\n\\n\\n As long as it stalled off the cops, I\\'d talk to Partridge.\\n\\n\\n We took a couple of camp chairs and I told him the story of my life, or\\n most of it. It was hard work on an empty stomach; I wished I\\'d had some\\n of that turkey soup. Then again I was glad I hadn\\'t. Something always\\n happened to me when I thought back over my life. The same thing.\\n\\n\\n The men filed out of the kitchen, wiping their chins, and I went right\\n on talking.\\n\\n\\n After some time Sister Partridge bustled in and snapped on the overhead\\n lights and I kept talking. The brother still hadn\\'t used the phone to\\n call the cops.\\n\\n\\n \"Remarkable,\" Partridge finally said when I got so hoarse I had to take\\n a break. \"One is almost—\\nalmost\\n—reminded of Job. William, you are\\n being punished for some great sin. Of that, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Punished for a sin? But, Brother, I\\'ve always had it like this, as\\n long as I can remember. What kind of a sin could I have committed when\\n I was fresh out of my crib?\"\\n\\n\\n \"William, all I can tell you is that time means nothing in Heaven. Do\\n you deny the transmigration of souls?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said, \"I\\'ve had no personal experience—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course you have, William! Say you don\\'t remember. Say you don\\'t\\n want to remember. But don\\'t say you have no personal experience!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you think I\\'m being punished for something I did in a previous\\n life?\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me in disbelief. \"What else could it be?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know,\" I confessed. \"I certainly haven\\'t done anything that\\n bad in\\nthis\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\\n \"William, if you atone for this sin, perhaps the horde of locusts will\\n lift from you.\"\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t much of a chance, but I was unused to having any at all. I\\n shook off the dizziness of it. \"By the Lord Harry, Brother, I\\'m going\\n to give it a try!\" I cried.\\n\\n\\n \"I believe you,\" Partridge said, surprised at himself.\\n\\n\\n He ambled over to the money box on the wall. He tapped the bottom\\n lightly and a box with no top slid out of the slightly larger box. He\\n reached in, fished out the bill and presented it to me.\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps this will help in your atonement,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I crumpled it into my pocket fast. Not meaning to sound ungrateful, I\\'m\\n pretty sure he hadn\\'t noticed it was a twenty.\\n\\n\\n And then the bill seemed to lie there, heavy, a lead weight. It would\\n have been different if I had managed to get it out of the box myself.\\n You know how it is.\\n\\n\\n Money you haven\\'t earned doesn\\'t seem real to you.\\nThere was something I forgot to mention so far. During the year between\\n when I got out of the reformatory and the one when I tried to steal\\n Brother Partridge\\'s money, I killed a man.\\n\\n\\n It was all an accident, but killing somebody is reason enough to get\\n punished. It didn\\'t have to be a sin in some previous life, you see.\\n\\n\\n I had gotten my first job in too long, stacking boxes at the freight\\n door of Baysinger\\'s. The drivers unloaded the stuff, but they just\\n dumped it off the truck. An empty rear end was all they wanted. The\\n freight boss told me to stack the boxes inside, neat and not too close\\n together.\\n\\n\\n I stacked boxes the first day. I stacked more the second. The third day\\n I went outside with my baloney and crackers. It was warm enough even\\n for November.\\n\\n\\n Two of them, dressed like Harvard seniors, caps and striped duffer\\n jackets, came up to the crate I was dining off.\\n\\n\\n \"Work inside, Jack?\" the taller one asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said, chewing.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you do, Jack?\" the fatter one asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Stack boxes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Got a union card?\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n\\n \"Application?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I\\'m just helping out during Christmas.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a scab, buddy,\" Long-legs said. \"Don\\'t you read the papers?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t like comic strips,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n They sighed. I think they hated to do it, but I was bucking the system.\\n\\n\\n Fats hit me high. Long-legs hit me low. I blew cracker crumbs into\\n their faces. After that, I just let them go. I know how to take a\\n beating. That\\'s one thing I knew.\\n\\n\\n Then lying there, bleeding to myself, I heard them talking. I heard\\n noises like\\nmake an example of him\\nand\\ndo something permanent\\nand I\\n squirmed away across the rubbish like a polite mouse.\\n\\n\\n I made it around a corner of brick and stood up, hurting my knee on a\\n piece of brown-splotched pipe. There were noises on the other angle of\\n the corner and so I tested if the pipe was loose and it was. I closed\\n my eyes and brought the pipe up and then down.\\n\\n\\n It felt as if I connected, but I was so numb, I wasn\\'t sure until I\\n unscrewed my eyes.\\n\\n\\n There was a big man in a heavy wool overcoat and gray homburg spread on\\n a damp centerfold from the\\nNews\\n. There was a pick-up slip from the\\n warehouse under the fingers of one hand, and somebody had beaten his\\n brains out.\\n\\n\\n The police figured it was part of some labor dispute, I guess, and they\\n never got to me.\\n\\n\\n I suppose I was to blame anyway. If I hadn\\'t been alive, if I hadn\\'t\\n been there to get beaten up, it wouldn\\'t have happened. I could see\\n the point in making me suffer for it. There was a lot to be said for\\n looking at it like that. But there was nothing to be said for telling\\n Brother Partridge about the accident, or murder, or whatever had\\n happened that day.\\nSearching myself after I left Brother Partridge, I finally found a\\n strip of gray adhesive tape on my side, out of the fuzzy area. Making\\n the twenty the size of a thick postage stamp, I peeled back the tape\\n and put the folded bill on the white skin and smoothed the tape back.\\n\\n\\n There was only one place for me to go now. I headed for the public\\n library. It was only about twenty blocks, but not having had anything\\n to eat since the day before, it enervated me.\\n\\n\\n The downstairs washroom was where I went first. There was nobody\\n there but an old guy talking urgently to a kid with thick glasses,\\n and somebody building a fix in one of the booths. I could see charred\\n matches dropping down on the floor next to his tennis shoes, and even a\\n few grains of white stuff. But he managed to hold still enough to keep\\n from spilling more from the spoon.\\n\\n\\n I washed my hands and face, smoothed my hair down, combing it with my\\n fingers. Going over my suit with damp toweling got off a lot of the\\n dirt. I put my collar on the outside of my jacket and creased the\\n wings with my thumbnail so it would look more like a sports shirt.\\n It didn\\'t really. I still looked like a bum, but sort of a neat,\\n non-objectionable bum.\\n\\n\\n The librarian at the main desk looked sympathetically hostile, or\\n hostilely sympathetic.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d like to get into the stacks, miss,\" I said, \"and see some of the\\n old newspapers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Which newspapers?\" the old girl asked stiffly.\\n\\n\\n I thought back. I couldn\\'t remember the exact date. \"Ones for the first\\n week in November last year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We have the\\nTimes\\nmicrofilmed. I would have to project them for you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t want to see the\\nTimes\\n,\" I said, fast. \"Don\\'t you have any\\n newspapers on paper?\" I didn\\'t want her to see what I wanted to read up\\n on.\\n\\n\\n \"We have the\\nNews\\n, bound, for last year.\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. \"That\\'s the one I wanted to see.\"\\n\\n\\n She sniffed and told me to follow her. I didn\\'t rate a cart to my\\n table, I guess, or else the bound papers weren\\'t supposed to come out\\n of the stacks.\\n\\n\\n The cases of books, row after row, smelled good. Like old leather and\\n good pipe tobacco. I had been here before. In this world, it\\'s the man\\n with education who makes the money. I had been reading the Funk &amp;\\n Wagnalls Encyclopedia. So far I knew a lot about Mark Antony, Atomic\\n Energy, Boron, Brussels, Catapults, Demons, and Divans.\\n\\n\\n I guess I had stopped to look around at some of the titles, because the\\n busy librarian said sharply, \"Follow me.\"\\n\\n\\n I heard my voice say, \"A pleasure. What about after work?\"\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t say it, but I was used to my voice independently saying\\n things. Her neck got to flaming, but she walked stiffly ahead. She\\n didn\\'t say anything. She must be awful mad, I decided. But then I got\\n the idea she was flushed with pleasure. I\\'m pretty ugly and I looked\\n like a bum, but I was young. You had to grant me that.\\n\\n\\n She waved a hand at the rows of bound\\nNews\\nand left me alone with\\n them. I wasn\\'t sure if I was allowed to hunt up a table to lay the\\n books on or not, so I took the volume for last year and laid it on the\\n floor. That was the cleanest floor I ever saw.\\n\\n\\n It didn\\'t take me long to find the story. The victim was a big man,\\n because the story was on the second page of the Nov. 4 edition.\\n\\n\\n I started to tear the page out, then only memorized the name and home\\n address. Somebody was sure to see me and I couldn\\'t risk trouble just\\n now.\\n\\n\\n I stuck the book back in line and left by the side door.\\nI went to a dry-cleaner, not the cheapest place I knew, because I\\n wouldn\\'t be safe with the change from a twenty in that neighborhood.\\n My suit was cleaned while I waited. I paid a little extra and had\\n it mended. Funny thing about a suit—it\\'s almost never completely\\n shot unless you just have it ripped off you or burned up. It wasn\\'t\\n exactly in style, but some rich executives wore suits out of style\\n that they had paid a lot of money for. I remembered Fredric March\\'s\\n double-breasted in\\nExecutive Suite\\nwhile Walter Pidgeon and the rest\\n wore Ivy Leagues. Maybe I would look like an eccentric executive.\\n\\n\\n I bought a new shirt, a good used pair of shoes, and a dime pack of\\n single-edged razor blades. I didn\\'t have a razor, but anybody with\\n nerve can shave with a single-edge blade and soap and water.\\n\\n\\n The clerk took my two bucks in advance and I went up to my room.\\n\\n\\n I washed out my socks and underwear, took a bath, shaved and trimmed\\n my hair and nails with the razor blade. With some soap on my finger, I\\n scrubbed my teeth. Finally I got dressed.\\n\\n\\n Everything was all right except that I didn\\'t have a tie. They had\\n them, a quarter a piece, where I got the shoes. It was only six\\n blocks—I could go back. But I didn\\'t want to wait. I wanted to\\n complete the picture.\\n\\n\\n The razor blade sliced through the pink bath towel evenly. I cut out a\\n nice modern-style tie, narrow, with some horizontal stripes down at the\\n bottom. I made a tight, thin knot. It looked pretty good.\\n\\n\\n I was ready to leave, so I started for the door. I went back. I had\\n almost forgotten my luggage. The box still had three unwrapped blades\\n in it. I pocketed it. I hefted the used blade, dulled by all the work\\n it had done. You can run being economical into stinginess. I tossed it\\n into the wastebasket.\\n\\n\\n I had five hamburgers and five cups of coffee. I couldn\\'t finish all of\\n the French fries.\\n\\n\\n \"Mac,\" I said to the fat counterman, who looked like all fat\\n countermen, \"give me a Milwaukee beer.\"\\n\\n\\n He stopped polishing the counter in front of his friend. \"Milwaukee,\\n Wisconsin, or Milwaukee, Oregon?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wisconsin.\"\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t argue.\\n\\n\\n It was cold and bitter. All beer is bitter, no matter what they say on\\n TV. I like beer. I like the bitterness of it.\\n\\n\\n It felt like another, but I checked myself. I needed a clear head.\\n I thought about going back to the hotel for some sleep; I still had\\n the key in my pocket \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mI wasn\\'t trusting it to any clerk\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. No, I had\\n had sleep on Thanksgiving, bracing up for trying the lift at Brother\\n Partridge\\'s. Let\\'s see, it was daylight outside again, so this was the\\n day after Thanksgiving. But it had only been sixteen or twenty hours\\n since I had slept. That was enough.\\n\\n\\n I left the money on the counter for the hamburgers and coffee and the\\n beer. There was $7.68 left.\\n\\n\\n As I passed the counterman\\'s friend on his stool, my voice said, \"I\\n think you\\'re yellow.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned slowly, his jaw moving further away from his brain.\\n\\n\\n I winked. \"It was just a bet for me to say that to you. I won two\\n bucks. Half of it is yours.\" I held out the bill to him.\\n\\n\\n His paw closed over the money and punched me on the biceps. Too hard.\\n He winked back. \"It\\'s okay.\"\\n\\n\\n I rubbed my shoulder, marching off fast, and I counted my money. With\\n my luck, I might have given the counterman\\'s friend the five instead of\\n one of the singles. But I hadn\\'t. I now had $6.68 left.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\nstill\\nthink you\\'re yellow,\" my voice said.\\n\\n\\n It was my voice, but it didn\\'t come from me. There were no words, no\\n feeling of words in my throat. It just came out of the air the way it\\n always did.\\n\\n\\n I ran.\\nHarold R. Thompkins, 49, vice-president of Baysinger\\'s, was found\\n dead behind the store last night. His skull had been crushed by a\\n vicious beating with a heavy implement, Coroner McClain announced in\\n preliminary verdict. Tompkins, who resided at 1467 Claremont, Edgeway,\\n had been active in seeking labor-management peace in the recent\\n difficulties....\\n\\n\\n I had read that a year before. The car cards on the clanking subway and\\n the rumbling bus didn\\'t seem nearly so interesting to me. Outside the\\n van, a tasteful sign announced the limits of the village of Edgeway,\\n and back inside, the monsters of my boyhood went\\nbloomp\\nat me.\\n\\n\\n I hadn\\'t seen anything like them in years.\\n\\n\\n The slimy, scaly beasts were slithering over the newspaper holders,\\n the ad card readers, the girl watchers as the neat little carbon-copy\\n modern homes breezed past the windows.\\nI ignored the devils and concentrated on reading the withered,\\n washed-out political posters on the telephone poles. My neck ached from\\n holding it so stiff, staring out through the glass. More than that, I\\n could feel the jabberwocks staring at me. You know how it is. You can\\n feel a stare with the back of your neck and between your eyes. They got\\n one brush of a gaze out of me.\\n\\n\\n The things abruptly started their business, trying to act casually as\\n if they hadn\\'t been waiting for me to look at them at all. They had a\\n little human being of some sort.\\n\\n\\n It was the size of a small boy, like the small boy who looked like me\\n that they used to destroy when I was locked up with them in the dark.\\n Except this was a man, scaled down to child\\'s size. He had sort of an\\n ugly, worried, tired, stupid look and he wore a shiny suit with a piece\\n of a welcome mat or something for a necktie. Yeah, it was me. I really\\n knew it all the time.\\n\\n\\n They began doing things to the midget me. I didn\\'t even lift an\\n eyebrow. They couldn\\'t do anything worse to the small man than they\\n had done to the young boy. It was sort of nostalgic watching them, but\\n I really got bored with all that violence and killing and killing the\\n same kill over and over. Like watching the Saturday night string of\\n westerns in a bar.\\n\\n\\n The sunlight through the window was yellow and hot. After a time, I\\n began to dose.\\n\\n\\n The shrieks woke me up.\\n\\n\\n For the first time, I could hear the shrieks of the monster\\'s victim\\n and listen to their obscene droolings. For the very first time in my\\n life. Always before it had been all pantomime, like Charlie Chaplin.\\n Now I heard the sounds of it all.\\n\\n\\n They say it\\'s a bad sign when you start hearing voices.\\n\\n\\n I nearly panicked, but I held myself in the seat and forced myself\\n to be rational about it. My own voice was always saying things\\neverybody\\ncould hear but which I didn\\'t say. It wasn\\'t any worse to\\n be the\\nonly\\none who could hear other things I never said. I was as\\n sane as I ever was. There was no doubt about that.\\n\\n\\n But a new thought suddenly impressed itself on me.\\n\\n\\n Whatever was punishing me for my sin was determined that I turn back\\n before reaching 1467 Claremont.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the\\n humidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in\\n a cloudless blue sky.\\n\\n\\n His pockets were picked eleven times.\\n\\n\\n It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a\\n masterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey\\n Fownes\\' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He\\n was strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses,\\n one after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions.\\n But he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to\\n begin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so\\n deeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many\\n people were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome\\n Conditions \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32ma crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m when a bogus\\n postman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the\\n confusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman\\n rifled Fownes\\'s handkerchief and inside jacket pockets.\\nHe was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl\\n happened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his\\n right and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence.\\n The sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time.\\n He should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a\\n heated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his\\n rear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the\\nhandkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put\\n and take—the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he\\n was playing.\\n\\n\\n There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.\\n\\n\\n It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist,\\n hitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of\\n a celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light\\n fragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome\\n weevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the\\n huge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.\\n\\n\\n Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still\\n intrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity\\n that was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this\\n rather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight\\n surveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting\\n his fingerprints off the postman\\'s bag, and which photographed, X-rayed\\n and chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning\\n them. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a\\n five-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of\\n Paris. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and\\n handedness behind.\\n\\n\\n By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete\\n with photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an\\n orange patrol car parked down the street.\\nLanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job.\\n\\n\\n Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes\\n approach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an\\n odd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar\\n to that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and\\n particularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope.\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre\\'s job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn\\'t be tolerated\\n within the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social\\n force; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it,\\n Lanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that\\n genuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own\\n small efforts, rarer.\\n\\n\\n Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable.\\n Lanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes.\\n\\n\\n \"Sometimes his house\\nshakes\\n,\" Lanfierre said.\\n\\n\\n \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he\\n stopped and frowned. He reread what he\\'d just written.\\n\\n\\n \"You heard right. The house\\nshakes\\n,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it.\\n\\n\\n MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of\\n the windshield. \"Like from ...\\nside to side\\n?\" he asked in a somewhat\\n patronizing tone of voice.\\n\\n\\n \"And up and down.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange\\n uniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed\\n the dossier carelessly on the back seat.\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride\\n couldn\\'t really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride\\n was a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He\\n had even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly\\n absurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was\\n only with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes\\n to MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had\\n seen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly\\n resounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke\\n in an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably\\n trite.\\n\\n\\n Then a fine robust freak came along and the others—the echoes—refused\\n to believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a\\n vacation.\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A\\n zephyr?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve heard some.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong\\n winds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can\\'t imagine. And if there was\\n a house sitting on such a mountain and if winds\\ndid\\nblow, it would\\n shake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the\\n whole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down\\n the avenue.\"\\nLieutenant MacBride pursed his lips.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll tell you something else,\" Lanfierre went on. \"The\\nwindows\\nall\\n close at the same time. You\\'ll be watching and all of a sudden every\\n single window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned\\n back in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think\\n there\\'s a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal—as if\\n they all had something important to say but had to close the windows\\n first so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city?\\n And then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into\\n conversation—and that\\'s why the house shakes.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride whistled.\\n\\n\\n \"No, I don\\'t need a vacation.\"\\n\\n\\n A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the\\n windshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\\n\\n\\n \"No, you don\\'t need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You\\'re starting to see\\n flying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You\\'ve got winds in your\\n brain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality—\"\\n\\n\\n At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed\\n shut.\\n\\n\\n The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound.\\n MacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the\\n ghostly babble of voices to commence.\\n\\n\\n The house began to shake.\\n\\n\\n It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and\\n dipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The\\n house could have been preparing to take off and sail down the....\\n\\n\\n MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then\\n they both looked back at the dancing house.\\n\\n\\n \"And the\\nwater\\n,\" Lanfierre said. \"The\\nwater\\nhe uses! He could be\\n the thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole\\n family of thirsty and clean kids, and he\\nstill\\nwouldn\\'t need all that\\n water.\"\\n\\n\\n The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages\\n now in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did\\n you see what he carries in his pockets?\"\\n\\n\\n \"And compasses won\\'t work on this street.\"\\n\\n\\n The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\\n\\n\\n He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It\\n expressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\\n neurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\\n was something implacable about his sighs.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\\n with a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\\n the widow\\'s next door and then the library.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride\\'s eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\\n said. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t wait to see what he\\'s got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\\n watching the house with a consuming interest.\\n\\n\\n They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\\n widened as the house danced a new step.\\nFownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off his\\n shoes. He hadn\\'t seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation\\n of his was also responsible for the dancing house—he simply hadn\\'t\\n noticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He\\n had a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the\\n high-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the\\n house. At least, he called it buffeting; he\\'d never thought to watch\\n from outside.\\n\\n\\n He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room\\n left in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a\\n draw-pull.\\n\\n\\n Every window slammed shut.\\n\\n\\n \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the\\n closet at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that\\n right? No,\\nsnug as a hug in a rug\\n. He went on, thinking:\\nThe old\\n devils.\\nThe downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of\\n wheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw\\n that went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had a\\n curious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from\\n grandfather\\'s clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful\\n circles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there\\n was one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He\\n watched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for\\n seven o\\'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.\\n\\n\\n Outside, the domed city vanished.\\n\\n\\n It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,\\n the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more\\n satisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.\\n Looking through the window he saw only a garden.\\n\\n\\n Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun\\n setting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left\\n the smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a\\n huge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a\\n garden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.\\n\\n\\n Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.\\nAnd cocktails for\\n two.\\nBlast, he\\'d never be able to figure that one out! He watched as\\n the moon played,\\nOh, You Beautiful Doll\\nand the neon roses flashed\\n slowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on\\n the scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated rose\\n as the moon shifted to\\nPeople Will Say We\\'re In Love\\n.\\nHe rubbed his chin critically. It\\nseemed\\nall right. A dreamy sunset,\\n an enchanted moon, flowers, scent.\\n\\n\\n They were all purely speculative of course. He had no idea how a rose\\n really smelled—or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. But\\n then, neither did the widow. He\\'d have to be confident, assertive.\\nInsist\\non it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic\\n romantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy\\n fingers marching up and down your spine?\\n\\n\\n His own spine didn\\'t seem to be affected. But then he hadn\\'t read that\\n book on ancient mores and courtship customs.\\n\\n\\n How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly\\n long and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount\\n of falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\"\\n meant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the\\n circumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later on\\n this evening.\\n\\n\\n He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker,\\n thinking roguishly:\\nThou shalt not inundate.\\nThe risks he was taking!\\n A shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant\\nSinging in the Rain\\n. Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red sun\\n continued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over and\\n demolished several of the neon roses.\\n\\n\\n The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steering\\n wheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; he\\n gingerly turned it.\\n\\n\\n Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle of\\n winds came to him.\\n\\n\\n He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This was\\n important; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents.\\n The neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose and\\n the moon shook a trifle as it whispered\\nCuddle Up a Little Closer\\n.\\n\\n\\n He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start.\\nMy dear\\n Mrs. Deshazaway.\\nToo formal. They\\'d be looking out at the romantic\\n garden; time to be a bit forward.\\nMy very dear Mrs. Deshazaway.\\nNo.\\n Contrived. How about a simple,\\nDear Mrs. Deshazaway\\n. That might be\\n it.\\nI was wondering, seeing as how it\\'s so late, if you wouldn\\'t\\n rather stay over instead of going home....\\nPreoccupied, he hadn\\'t noticed the winds building up, didn\\'t hear the\\n shaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected\\n to wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made\\n one gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as\\n high-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the\\n Studebaker valve wider and wider....\\n\\n\\n The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sun\\n shot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moon\\n fell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning\\nWhen the\\n Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\\n.\\n\\n\\n The shaking house finally woke him up. He scrambled upstairs to the\\n Studebaker wheel and shut it off.\\n\\n\\n At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn\\'t\\n the first time the winds got out of line.\\n\\n\\n Why didn\\'t she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all down\\n and went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months,\\n about stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April.\\n Its days were thirty and it followed September.\\nAnd all the rest have\\n thirty-one.\\nWhat a strange people, the ancients!\\n\\n\\n He still didn\\'t see the orange car parked down the street.\\n\"Men are too perishable,\" Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. \"For all\\n practical purposes I\\'m never going to marry again. All my husbands die.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said.\\n\\n\\n She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don\\'t look at me\\n that way,\" she said. \"I\\'m\\nnot\\ngoing to marry you and if you want\\n reasons I\\'ll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\"\\n\\n\\n The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything\\n passionately—talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately\\n red. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry\\n tinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had\\n never known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\"\\n she said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for\\n her to be, to explain why she couldn\\'t marry him. \"Do you have any\\n idea what people are saying? They\\'re all saying I\\'m a cannibal! I rob\\n my husbands of their life force and when they\\'re empty I carry their\\n bodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there\\'ll be\\n talk.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s the air! Why don\\'t they talk about that? The air is stale,\\n I\\'m positive. It\\'s not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt,\\n Norman and Alphonse couldn\\'t stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so\\n healthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily\\n worse for him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t seem to mind the air.\"\\n\\n\\n She threw up her hands. \"You\\'d be the worst of the lot!\" She left the\\n table, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try\\n some of the asparagus.\\nFive.\\nThat\\'s what they\\'d say. That woman did\\n it again. And the plain fact is I don\\'t want you on my record.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\"\\n\\n\\n He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his\\n shoulders. \"And what about those\\nvery\\nelaborate plans you\\'ve been\\n making to seduce me?\"\\n\\n\\n Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you think\\nthey\\'ll\\nfind out?\\nI\\nfound out and you can bet\\nthey\\nwill. It\\'s my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don\\'t\\n always tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it\\n wasn\\'t the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can\\'t\\n have another man die on me, it\\'s bad for my self-esteem. And now you\\'ve\\n gone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\"\\nFownes put his fork down. \"Dear Mrs. Deshazaway,\" he started to say.\\n\\n\\n \"And of course when they do find out and they ask you why, Mr. Fownes,\\n you\\'ll tell them. No, no heroics, please! When they ask a man a\\n question he always answers and you will too. You\\'ll tell them I wanted\\n to be courted and when they hear that they\\'ll be around to ask\\nme\\na\\n few questions. You see, we\\'re both a bit queer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hadn\\'t thought of that,\" Fownes said quietly.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, it doesn\\'t really matter. I\\'ll join Andrew, Curt, Norman—\"\\n\\n\\n \"That won\\'t be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all\\n due respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state\\n here and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We\\'re\\n lost, you and I.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s impossible! How?\"\\n\\n\\n In no hurry, now that he had the widow\\'s complete attention, Fownes\\n leaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway?\\n Space? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has\\n no control whatever? Where the\\nwind\\nblows across\\nprairies\\n; or is\\n it the other way around? No matter. How would you like\\nthat\\n, Mrs.\\n Deshazaway?\"\\n\\n\\n Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her\\n two hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.\\n And June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is\\n supposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond\\n the dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAnd\\n,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say\\n that somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,\\n the sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it\\'s\\nvernal\\nand that\\'s when it roams the Open Country where geigers no\\n longer scintillate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMy.\\n\" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came\\n back to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us\\n outside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays\\nwarm\\nlong enough\\n for his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...\\n you may call me Agnes.\"\\nWhen Humphrey Fownes stepped out of the widow\\'s house, there was a\\n look of such intense abstraction on his features that Lanfierre felt a\\n wistful desire to get out of the car and walk along with the man. It\\n would be such a\\ndeliciously\\ninsane experience. \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\"April has thirty\\n days,\" Fownes mumbled, passing them, \"because thirty is the largest\\n number such that all smaller numbers not having a common divisor\\n with it are\\nprimes\\n.\" MacBride frowned and added it to the dossier.\\n Lanfierre sighed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n Pinning his hopes on the Movement, Fownes went straight to the\\n library several blocks away, a shattered depressing place given over\\n to government publications and censored old books with holes in\\n them. It was used so infrequently that the Movement was able to meet\\n there undisturbed. The librarian was a yellowed, dog-eared woman of\\n eighty. She spent her days reading ancient library cards and, like the\\n books around her, had been rendered by time\\'s own censor into near\\n unintelligibility.\\n\\n\\n \"Here\\'s one,\" she said to him as he entered. \"\\nGulliver\\'s Travels.\\nLoaned to John Wesley Davidson on March 14, 1979 for\\nfive\\ndays. What\\n do you make of it?\"\\n\\n\\n In the litter of books and cards and dried out ink pads that surrounded\\n the librarian, Fownes noticed a torn dust jacket with a curious\\n illustration. \"What\\'s that?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"A twister,\" she replied quickly. \"Now listen to\\nthis\\n. Seven years\\n later on March 21, 1986, Ella Marshall Davidson took out the same book.\\n What do you make of\\nthat\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d say,\" Humphrey Fownes said, \"that he ... that he recommended it\\n to her, that one day they met in the street and he told her about\\n this book and then they ... they went to the library together and she\\n borrowed it and eventually, why eventually they got married.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah! They were brother and sister!\" the librarian shouted in her\\n parched voice, her old buckram eyes laughing with cunning.\\n\\n\\n Fownes smiled weakly and looked again at the dust jacket. The twister\\n was unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like\\n a malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying\\n a Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn\\'t help wondering if twisters did anything\\n to feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit\\n night, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket\\n in his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling\\n after him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though\\n reading inscriptions on a tombstone.\\nThe Movement met in what had been the children\\'s room, where unpaid\\n ladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other\\n people\\'s offspring. The members sat around at the miniature tables\\n looking oddly like giants fled from their fairy tales, protesting.\\n\\n\\n \"Where did the old society fail?\" the leader was demanding of them. He\\n stood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. He\\n glanced around at the group almost complacently, and waited as Humphrey\\n Fownes squeezed into an empty chair. \"We live in a dome,\" the leader\\n said, \"for lack of something. An invention! What is the one thing\\n that the great technological societies before ours could not invent,\\n notwithstanding their various giant brains, electronic and otherwise?\"\\n\\n\\n Fownes was the kind of man who never answered a rhetorical question. He\\n waited, uncomfortable in the tight chair, while the others struggled\\n with this problem in revolutionary dialectics.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nA sound foreign policy\\n,\" the leader said, aware that no one else had\\n obtained the insight. \"If a sound foreign policy can\\'t be created the\\n only alternative is not to have any foreign policy at all. Thus the\\n movement into domes began—\\nby common consent of the governments\\n. This\\n is known as self-containment.\"\\n\\n\\n Dialectically out in left field, Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull\\n in the ensuing discussion and then politely inquired how it might be\\n arranged for him to get out.\\n\\n\\n \"Out?\" the leader said, frowning. \"Out? Out where?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Outside the dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh. All in good time, my friend. One day we shall all pick up and\\n leave.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And that day I\\'ll await impatiently,\" Fownes replied with marvelous\\n tact, \"because it will be lonely out there for the two of us. My future\\n wife and I have to leave\\nnow\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense. Ridiculous! You have to be prepared for the Open Country.\\n You can\\'t just up and leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. And\\n dialectically very poor.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you\\nhave\\ndiscussed preparations, the practical necessities of\\n life in the Open Country. Food, clothing, a weapon perhaps? What else?\\n Have I left anything out?\"\\n\\n\\n The leader sighed. \"The gentleman wants to know if he\\'s left anything\\n out,\" he said to the group.\\n\\n\\n Fownes looked around at them, at some dozen pained expressions.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell the man what he\\'s forgotten,\" the leader said, walking to the far\\n window and turning his back quite pointedly on them.\\n\\n\\n Everyone spoke at the same moment. \"\\nA sound foreign policy\\n,\" they all\\n said, it being almost too obvious for words.\\nOn his way out the librarian shouted at him: \"\\nA Tale of a Tub\\n,\\n thirty-five years overdue!\" She was calculating the fine as he closed\\n the door.\\n\\n\\n Humphrey Fownes\\' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was one\\n block away from his house. It was then that he realized something\\n unusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police\\n was parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.\\n\\n\\n His house was dancing.\\n\\n\\n It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one\\'s\\n residence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight\\n that for the moment he didn\\'t give a thought to what might be causing\\n it. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its\\n own independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense\\n curiosity.\\n\\n\\n The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.\\n\\n\\n From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as\\n his favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of\\n cold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A\\n wild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs,\\n suits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa\\n cushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an\\n old, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his\\n ancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.\\n\\n\\n He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying\\n with his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his\\n cheeks. He got hit by a shoe.\\n\\n\\n As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over\\n his face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.\\n\\n\\n \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called.\\n\\n\\n Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his\\n dripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the\\n distance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWinds\\n,\" he said in a whisper.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMarch\\nwinds,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What?!\"\\n\\n\\n \"April showers!\"\\n\\n\\n The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride\\'s lost voice emerged\\n from the blackness of the living room. \"These are\\nnot\\nOptimum Dome\\n Conditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is\\nnot\\n59 degrees.\\n The humidity is\\nnot\\n47%!\"\\nFownes held his face up to let the rain fall on it. \"Moonlight!\" he\\n shouted. \"Roses! My\\nsoul\\nfor a cocktail for two!\" He grasped the\\n doorway to keep from being blown out of the house.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you going to make it stop or aren\\'t you!\" MacBride yelled.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll have to tell me what you did first!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\ntold\\nhim not to touch that wheel! Lanfierre. He\\'s in the upstairs\\n bedroom!\"\\n\\n\\n When he heard this Fownes plunged into the house and fought his way\\n up the stairs. He found Lanfierre standing outside the bedroom with a\\n wheel in his hand.\\n\"What have I done?\" Lanfierre asked in the monotone of shock.\\n\\n\\n Fownes took the wheel. It was off a 1995 Studebaker.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not sure what\\'s going to come of this,\" he said to Lanfierre with\\n an astonishing amount of objectivity, \"but the entire dome air supply\\n is now coming through my bedroom.\"\\n\\n\\n The wind screamed.\\n\\n\\n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not any more there isn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n They started down the stairs carefully, but the wind caught them and\\n they quickly reached the bottom in a wet heap.\\n\\n\\n Recruiting Lieutenant MacBride from behind his sofa, the men carefully\\n edged out of the house and forced the front door shut.\\n\\n\\n The wind died. The fog dispersed. They stood dripping in the Optimum\\n Dome Conditions of the bright avenue.\\n\\n\\n \"I never figured on\\nthis\\n,\" Lanfierre said, shaking his head.\\n\\n\\n With the front door closed the wind quickly built up inside the house.\\n They could see the furnishing whirl past the windows. The house did a\\n wild, elated jig.\\n\\n\\n \"What kind of a place\\nis\\nthis?\" MacBride said, his courage beginning\\n to return. He took out his notebook but it was a soggy mess. He tossed\\n it away.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, he was\\ndifferent\\n,\" Lanfierre murmured. \"I knew that much.\"\\n\\n\\n When the roof blew off they weren\\'t really surprised. With a certain\\n amount of equanimity they watched it lift off almost gracefully,\\n standing on end for a moment before toppling to the ground. It was\\n strangely slow motion, as was the black twirling cloud that now rose\\n out of the master bedroom, spewing shorts and socks and cases every\\n which way.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nNow\\nwhat?\" MacBride said, thoroughly exasperated, as this strange\\n black cloud began to accelerate, whirling about like some malevolent\\n top....\\nHumphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he\\'d found in the library. He\\n held it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom\\n with the illustration. The cloud rose and spun, assuming the identical\\n shape of the illustration.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a twister,\" he said softly. \"A Kansas twister!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What,\" MacBride asked, his bravado slipping away again, \"what ... is a\\n twister?\"\\n\\n\\n The twister roared and moved out of the bedroom, out over the rear of\\n the house toward the side of the dome. \"It says here,\" Fownes shouted\\n over the roaring, \"that Dorothy traveled from Kansas to Oz in a twister\\n and that ... and that Oz is a wonderful and mysterious land\\nbeyond the\\n confines of everyday living\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride\\'s eyes and mouth were great zeros.\\n\\n\\n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\\n\\n\\n Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them.\\n\\n\\n \"Fownes!\" MacBride shouted. \"This is a direct order! Make it go back!\"\\n\\n\\n But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging\\n mountainous puffs of glass as he went. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\" he shouted.\\n \"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!\"\\n\\n\\n The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the\\n precipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then,\\n emptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly\\n emptied and then rushed about empty-handed. \"Yoo-hoo!\" he yelled,\\n running. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister.\\n Optimum temperature collapsed. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\\nAgnes\\n, will you\\n marry me? Yoo-hoo!\"\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited,\\n dazed.\\n\\n\\n There was quite a large fall of glass.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\\n delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\\n ocean at last.\\n\\n\\n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\\n sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\\n of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\\n to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\\n\\n\\n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\\n whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\\n some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\\n the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\\n He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\\n clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\\n how tall the trees really were.\\n\\n\\n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\\n the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\\n had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\\n its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\\n heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\\n nimbi.\\n\\n\\n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\\n hurried toward the ocean.\\n\\n\\n If only the days weren\\'t so short! he thought. There was so much to\\n see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\\n the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\\n brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\\n remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\\n as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\\n were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\\n play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\\n three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\\n kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\\n\\n\\n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\\n day just for him. And who could say it wasn\\'t? he thought. Wasn\\'t this\\n his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\\n even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\\n wouldn\\'t dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\\n the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\\n care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When\\n Purnie had stopped time, the bees—like all the other creatures he\\n met—had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as\\n soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.\\nWhen he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\\n off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\\n clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\\n had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\\n far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\\n hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\\n He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\\n time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\\n\\n\\n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\\n when they learned of his brave journey.\\n\\n\\n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\\n gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\\n during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\\n dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\\n\\n\\n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\\n\\n\\n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\\n out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\\n awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\\n the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\\n exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\\n orange curls waiting to start that action.\\n\\n\\n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\\n frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\\n heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\\n in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\\n beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\\n the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\\n more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\\n animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\\n nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\\n tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\\n of munching seaweed.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\\n he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\\n time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\\n continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\\n\"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he\\n expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\\n activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\\n the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\\n continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\\n\\n\\n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\\n picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\\n their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\\n pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\\n delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\\n interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\\n with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\\n not the world around him.\\n\\n\\n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\\n tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\\n\\n\\n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\\n bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\\n position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\\n done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\\n mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\\n\\n\\n The tripon thought Purnie\\'s feat was superb. It stopped munching long\\n enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\\n repast.\\n\\n\\n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\\n once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\\n to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\\n the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\\n there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\\n\\n\\n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes\\n seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\\n\\n\\n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are\\n you going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in\\n San Diego?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie\\'s invitation got nothing more than\\n startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.\\n He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,\\n tagging along at their heels. \"I\\'ve got my lunch, want some?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, you\\'d better tell your men back there to stop gawking at\\n the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn\\'t pay for this\\n expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\\nThe animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\\n their heels.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it\\'s\\n your money that put us here; it\\'s your expedition all the way. But you\\n hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that\\'s just\\n what I\\'ve done. My job isn\\'t over yet. I\\'m responsible for the safety\\n of the men while we\\'re here, and for the safe trip home.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Precisely. And since you\\'re responsible, get \\'em working. Tell \\'em to\\n bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the\\n ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good God, man, aren\\'t you human? We\\'ve only been on this planet twenty\\n minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find\\n wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little\\n creatures that run up to us like we\\'re long-lost brothers. Let the men\\n look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\\n\\n\\n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\\n will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\\n joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\\n he got an upside down view of them walking away.\\n\\n\\n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\\n What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\\n more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\\n trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\\n his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\\n\\n\\n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\\n went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\\n\\n\\n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\\n vicinity. He\\'s trying to locate it now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make\\n you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That\\'ll make eighteen, I\\n believe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Radiation, bah! We\\'ve found low-grade ore on every planet I\\'ve\\n discovered so far, and this one\\'ll be no different. Now how about that\\n flag? Let\\'s get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes\\'s pennant raised and his\\n claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\\n now!\"\\nWhen the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\\n first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Benson, you won\\'t have to look far for materials to use for the\\n base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t use them. They\\'re petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\\n to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\\n slide down on top of us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well—that\\'s your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\\n solid. It\\'s got to stand at least—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, Forbes, we\\'ll get your monument erected. What\\'s this with\\n the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\\n flag.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There is, there is. Much more. I\\'ve taken care of all requirements set\\n down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\\n represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\\n is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\\n sentiment if you will.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, I won\\'t. I\\'ve seen real-estate flags before.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\\n What I\\'m doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. And if I\\'m not mistaken, you\\'ve set up a neat little escrow\\n system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\\n the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\\n It\\'s people like me who pay your way. It\\'s people like me who give your\\n space ships some place to go. It\\'s people like me who pour good money\\n into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\\n thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I imagine you\\'ll triple your money in six months.\"\\n\\n\\n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\\n the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\\n as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\\n himself, content to be in their company.\\n\\n\\n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\\n the remainder of the group running toward them.\\n\\n\\n \"Captain Benson! Here\\'s the flag, sir. And here\\'s Miles with the\\n scintillometer. He says the radiation\\'s getting stronger over this way!\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about that, Miles?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This thing\\'s going wild, Captain. It\\'s almost off scale.\"\\nPurnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.\\n Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"\\n He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful\\n noises, and he felt most satisfied.\\n\\n\\n \"Stand back, Captain! Here\\'s the source right here! This little\\n chuck-walla\\'s hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I\\'ll be damned! Now what do you\\n suppose—\"\\n\\n\\n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard\\n put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he\\n stood on one leg.\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\\n\\n\\n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,\\n they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of\\n these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools\\n on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I\\'ll have investors\\nflocking\\nto me. How about it, Benson—does pioneering pay off or\\n doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be\\n great danger to the crew—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now look here! You had planned to put\\nmineral\\nspecimens in a lead\\n box, so what\\'s the difference? Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll die.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and\\n what\\'s more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day\\n had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,\\n the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle\\n happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their\\n own tricks.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped\\n back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.\\n Purnie sat up to watch the show.\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Captain, why don\\'t I just pick him up? Looks like he has no\\n intention of running away.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you\\'re shielded, no telling what\\n powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I swear he knows what we\\'re saying. Look at those eyes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That\\'s a boy!\"\\nPurnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\\n imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn\\'t know\\n what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\\n wiggled in anticipation.\\n\\n\\n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\\n it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\\n surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\\n Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\\n protect himself.\\n\\n\\n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\\n attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\\n had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\\n into the little crowd. \"I\\'ve got my lunch, want some?\"\\n\\n\\n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\\n and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\\n He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\\n few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\\n to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\\n deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\\n\\n\\n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\\n\\n\\n \"There you are, boys. It\\'s all in knowing how. Just winged him, that\\'s\\n all. Now pick him up.\"\\n\\n\\n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie\\'s misery lay in his confusion.\\n What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\\n again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\\n power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\\n following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\\n directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\\n ordered the stoppage of time.\\n\\n\\n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\\n motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\\n transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\\n himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\\n understand.\\n\\n\\n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\\n to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\\n wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\\n he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\\n in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\\n end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal\\'s head.\\n He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\\n hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\\n Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\\n to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\\n explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\\n stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\\n three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\\n\\n\\n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\\n torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\\n country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\\n animals.\\n\\n\\n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\\n with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\\n with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn\\'t fit\\n into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\\n long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\\n didn\\'t dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\\n fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\\n abused this faculty.\\nWhen Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\\n open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the\\n spot where Purnie had been standing.\\n\\n\\n \"My God, he\\'s—he\\'s gone.\"\\n\\n\\n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\\n hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\\n \"All right, you people, what\\'s going on here? Get him in that box. What\\n did you do with him?\"\\n\\n\\n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\\n to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\\n was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\\n in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\\n\\n\\n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn\\'t that him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'ll be damned!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, I\\'m holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\\n you\\'ve botched it up, I\\'ll bring him down my own way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There\\'s something about that\\n fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\\n gun!\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\\n friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\\n Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\\n distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\\n the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\\n filled him with hysteria.\\n\\n\\n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\\n Others were pinned down on the sand.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I\\'m sorry! Can\\'t you hear?\" He\\n hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\\n shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\\n his ears from the beach. \"You\\'re getting all wet! Did you hear me?\\n Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\\n done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\\n tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\\n about.\\n\\n\\n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\\nPurnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.\\n The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of\\n death.\\n\\n\\n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I—I can\\'t move, Captain. My leg, it\\'s.... My God, we\\'re going to\\n drown!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us\\n here in the water—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he\\'s—\" His sounds were cut off by a\\n wavelet gently rolling over his head.\\n\\n\\n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the\\n animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding\\n the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\\n\\n\\n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\\n tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\\n slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far\\n as his friends\\' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\\n of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\\n he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,\\n where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The\\n hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the\\n logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\\n\\n\\n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\\n\\n\\n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after\\n another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he\\n started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\\n He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\\n position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\\n Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\\n a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\\n chaotic scene before him.\\n\\n\\n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\\n him.\\n\\n\\n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\\n time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\\n him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\\n he knew he must first resume time.\\n\\n\\n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\\n to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\\n late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\\n knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\\n\\n\\n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\\n time to resume, nothing happened.\\n\\n\\n His heart sank. He wasn\\'t afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\\n the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\\n wanted to see them safe.\\n\\n\\n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no\\nurging\\ntime to start. He knew he couldn\\'t persuade it by bits and pieces,\\n first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn\\'t. He\\n had to take one viewpoint or the other.\\n\\n\\n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took\\n command....\\nHis friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\\n and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\\n Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\\n What\\'s happening?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too. We\\'re either\\n crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not the logs. How about us? How\\'d we get out of the water? Miles,\\n we\\'re both cracking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m telling you, man, it\\'s the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.\\n I was looking right at them. First they\\'re on top of me, then they\\'re\\n piled up over there!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damnit, the logs didn\\'t pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain\\n Benson!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you men all right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes sir, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid we\\'re not seeing right, Captain. Those logs—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We\\'ve got to round up the\\n others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Rhodes, don\\'t you think I\\'d like to know? Those logs are so old\\n they\\'re petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn\\'t lift one. It would\\n take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so\\n busy eating seaweed—\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, let\\'s bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can\\'t\\n walk. Where\\'s Forbes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or\\n laughing. I can\\'t tell which.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all\\n right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they\\'ll\\n do anything I say! This one\\'s got a mind of its own. Did you see that\\n little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\\n\\n\\n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he\\'ll either kill himself or one\\n of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We\\'ll be along\\n shortly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I\\'m holding you personally responsible\\n for this. Hee-hee!\"\\nPurnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\\n\\n\\n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,\\n where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons\\n he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\\n three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\\n curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\\n behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\\n\\n\\n \"Is it possible that we\\'re all crazy, Captain?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s possible, but we\\'re not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I still can\\'t believe it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll never be the same.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back\\n there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us\\n suddenly—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But didn\\'t you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, him. I\\'m afraid not, Captain. I—I guess I was thinking mostly of\\n myself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him\\n too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t follow you, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got\\n him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil\\n come back to his tormentors—back to us—when we were trapped under\\n those logs?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn\\'t do\\n him any more harm.... I\\'m sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I\\'m\\n still a little shaky.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.\\n I\\'ll join you in a few minutes. I think I\\'ll go back and look around.\\n You know. Make sure we haven\\'t left anyone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No need to do that. They\\'re all ahead of us. I\\'ve checked.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\"\\nAs Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through\\n glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was\\n nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\\n had become familiar.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\\n beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\\n returned.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve made a terrible mistake. We—\" The sounds faded in and out on\\n Purnie\\'s ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\\n directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\\n logs and peer around and under them.\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'re hurt I\\'d like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\\n now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\\n shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\\n the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\\n the others.\\n\\n\\n Purnie\\'s eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\\n beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\\n white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\\n ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

She had the right curves in\\n the right places and would have been beautiful if her nose had been\\n smaller, if her mouth had been larger and if her hair had been wavy\\n instead of straight.\\n\\n\\n \"Hank said you wanted to see me,\" she said when she stopped beside\\n Joe\\'s table.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Joe nodded at the other chair. \"Have a seat.\" He reached into a\\n pocket, withdrew five ten-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"I want\\n you to do a job for me. It\\'ll only take a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl counted the money, then placed it in her purse. Joe noticed\\n a small counterfeit-detector inside the purse before she closed it.\\n \"What\\'s the job?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tell you later.\" He gulped the remainder of his drink, almost pouring\\n it down his throat.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey. You trying to make yourself sick?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to get drunk all afternoon.\" As the\\n liquor settled in his stomach, he waited for the warm glow. But the\\n glow didn\\'t come ... the bartender had watered his drink again.\\n\\n\\n \"Trying to get drunk?\" the girl inquired. \"Are you crazy?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. It\\'s simple. If I get drunk, I can join the AAA and get free room\\n and board for a month while they give me a treatment.\"\\n\\n\\n It was easy enough to understand, he reflected, but a lot harder to do.\\n The CPA robot bartenders saw to it that anyone got high if they wanted,\\n but comparatively few got drunk. Each bartender could not only mix\\n drinks but could also judge by a man\\'s actions and speech when he was\\n on the verge of drunkenness. At the proper time—since drunkenness was\\n illegal—a bartender always watered the drinks.\\n\\n\\n Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but\\n had always failed. And in all of New York\\'s millions, there had been\\n only a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year.\\n\\n\\n The girl laughed. \"If you\\'re that hard up, I don\\'t know if I should\\n take this fifty or not. Why don\\'t you go out and get a job like\\n everyone else?\"\\n\\n\\n As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she\\n saw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal\\n Tendencies.\\nWhen she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to\\n pieces. He\\'d done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to\\n get another—everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and\\n show it upon request.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry,\" the girl said. \"I didn\\'t know you were a DCT.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And who\\'ll hire a guy with criminal tendencies? You know the score.\\n When you try to get a job, they ask to see your ID before they even\\n tell you if there\\'s an opening or not. If your CPA ID says you\\'re a\\n DCT, you\\'re SOL and they tell you there\\'s no openings. Oh, I\\'ve had\\n several jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I\\'ve been a garbage man,\\n street-cleaner, ditch-digger—\"\\n\\n\\n On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and\\n a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.\\n\\n\\n Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned\\n across the table and whispered in the girl\\'s ear, \"That\\'s what I\\n want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get\\n convicted of a crime, I\\'ll be able to get a good job!\"\\n\\n\\n The girl\\'s lips formed a bright red circle. \"Say! You really got big\\n plans, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n He smiled at her admiration. It\\nwas\\nsomething big to plan a crime.\\n A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting,\\n blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA—Crime\\n Prevention Association. There were no longer any prisons—CPA officials\\n had declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent\\n crime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of\\n ingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime\\n almost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men\\n in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.\\n\\n\\n No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill\\n someone, for instance, he wasn\\'t sent to prison to be punished; he\\n wasn\\'t punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all\\n criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock\\n treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and\\n a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few\\n criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city could\\n afford the CPA hospitals.\\n\\n\\n The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because\\n it did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with\\n prisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.\\n\\n\\n And, ironically, a man who\\ndid\\ncommit a crime was a sort of hero. He\\n was a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses\\n to kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a\\n hero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was—when he left one of the\\n CPA hospitals—a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a\\n man who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.\\n And therefore, an EX \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32ma convicted criminal who received the treatment\\n was commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the\\n word an Ex-criminal\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the girl said. \"I\\'m honored. Really. But I got a date at ten.\\n Let\\'s get it over with. You said it\\'d only take a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay. Let\\'s go.\"\\nThe girl followed him across the room, around tables, through a door,\\n down a hall, through a back door and into the alley.\\n\\n\\n She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped\\n her blouse and skirt.\\n\\n\\n He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away,\\n her body poised like a wrestler\\'s. \"What\\'s the big idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Scream,\" Joe said. \"Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get\\n here, tell \\'em I tried to rape you.\"\\n\\n\\n The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the\\n few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime\\n because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the\\n intended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a\\n crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc.,\\n were not crimes. They weren\\'t crimes because the DCT didn\\'t complete\\n the act, and if he didn\\'t complete the act, that meant simply that the\\n CPA had once again functioned properly.\\n\\n\\n The girl shook her head vigorously. \"Sorry, buddy. Can\\'t help you that\\n way. Why didn\\'t you tell me what you wanted?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter?\" Joe complained. \"I\\'m not asking you to do anything\\n wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You stupid jerk. What do you think this is—the Middle Ages? Don\\'t you\\n know almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I\\'m a sergeant in\\n the WSDA!\"\\n\\n\\n Joe groaned. The WSDA—Women\\'s Self-Defense Association—a branch of\\n the CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even\\n developed new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in\\n those new techniques.\\n\\n\\n The girl was still shaking her head. \"Can\\'t do it, buddy. I\\'d lose my\\n rank if you were convicted of—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do I have to\\nmake\\nyou scream?\" Joe inquired tiredly and advanced\\n toward the girl.\\n\\n\\n \"—and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey!\\nStop it!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when\\n she said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body,\\n and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.\\nThe alley\\'s concrete floor was hard—it had always been hard, but he\\n became acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it.\\n There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful\\n stars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police\\n sirens. But the wonderful moment didn\\'t last long and darkness closed\\n in on him.\\nWhen he awoke, a rough voice was saying, \"Okay. Snap out of it.\"\\n\\n\\n He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner\\'s office. It\\n would be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture\\n except for a desk and chairs, but the walls were lined with the\\n controls of television screens, electronic calculators and a hundred\\n other machines that formed New York\\'s mechanical police force.\\n\\n\\n Commissioner Hendricks was a remarkable character. There was something\\n wrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with\\n bushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something\\n of his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate\\n hadn\\'t made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men\\n to high political positions were women.\\n\\n\\n Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly,\\n likable person. But the millions of women voters who saw his face on\\n posters and on their TV screens saw only the ugly face and heard only\\n the harsh voice. The President of the United States was a capable\\n man, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked\\n something like a bulldog had been elected as New York\\'s police\\n commissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s the girl?\" Joe asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I processed her while you were out cold. She left. Joe, you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"I\\'ll save you the trouble. I admit it. Attempted\\n rape. I confess.\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks smiled. \"Sorry, Joe. You missed the boat again.\" He reached\\n out and turned a dial on his desk top. \"We had a microphone hidden in\\n that alley. We have a lot of microphones hidden in a lot of alleys.\\n You\\'d be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in\\n alleys!\"\\n\\n\\n Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of\\n machines on the walls, \"\\nScream. Scream as loud as you can, and when\\n the cops get here, tell \\'em I tried to rape you.\\n\" And then the girl\\'s\\n voice, \"\\nSorry, buddy. Can\\'t help—\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\"\\nHendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was\\n slouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world\\n had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn\\'t a crime.\\n Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from\\n committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly\\n once again. That meant the CPA had once again\\nprevented\\ncrime, and\\n the CPA didn\\'t punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn\\'t attempt\\n to prevent crimes\\nby\\npunishment. If it did, that would be a violation\\n of the New Civil Rights.\\n\\n\\n Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a\\n button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.\\n\\n\\n When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words\\n DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before.\\n And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a\\n DCT First Class.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do\\n you? Now you\\'re a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know\\n what that means?\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face.\\n \"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers.\\n You\\'ll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it\\n works? It\\'s like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night\\n and they\\'re bored. Then Mr. Jones says, \\'Let\\'s go watch this Joe\\n Harper.\\' So they look up your record—amateur cops always keep records\\n of First Classes in scrapbooks—and they see that you stop frequently\\n at Walt\\'s Tavern.\\n\\n\\n \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not\\n to let you know they\\'re watching you. They watch you all night, just\\n hoping you\\'ll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone,\\n so they can be the first ones to yell \\'\\nPolice!\\n\\' They\\'ll watch you\\n because it\\'s exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever\\ndid\\nprevent you from committing a crime, they\\'d get a nice reward and\\n they\\'d be famous.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl—\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is\\n interesting. You see, it doesn\\'t stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There\\'s\\n thousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from\\n reading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because\\n it\\'s rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down\\n the street, there\\'ll be at least a dozen of \\'em following you, and no\\n matter where you go, you can bet there\\'ll be some of \\'em sitting next\\n to you, standing next to you.\\n\\n\\n \"During the day, they\\'ll take your picture with their spy cameras that\\n look like buttons on their coats. At night, they\\'ll peep at you through\\n your keyhole. Your neighbors across the street will watch you through\\n binoculars and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Lay off!\"\\nJoe squirmed in the chair. He\\'d been lectured by Hendricks before and\\n it was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talking\\n machine once he got started, a machine that couldn\\'t be stopped.\\n\\n\\n \"And the kids are the worst,\" Hendricks continued. \"They have Junior\\n CPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard\\n boxes. They\\'ll stare at you on the street and stare at you through\\n restaurant windows while you\\'re eating meals. They\\'ll follow you in\\n public rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes\\n while they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look\\n back, you\\'ll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a\\n block behind, giggling and gaping at you. They\\'ll follow you until the\\n day you die, because you\\'re a freak!\"\\n\\n\\n Joe couldn\\'t stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced\\n the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"And it doesn\\'t end\\nthere\\n, Joe. It goes on and on. You\\'ll be the\\n object of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop\\n you on the street and say, \\'I\\'d like to help you, friend.\\' Then they\\'ll\\n ask you queer questions like, \\'Did your father reject you when you were\\n a child?\\' \\'Do you like girls?\\' \\'How does it feel to be a DCT First\\n Class?\\' And then there\\'ll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They\\'ll stop\\n you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, goddam it!\\nStop it!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief\\n and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m doing you a favor, Joe. I\\'m trying to explain something you\\'re too\\n dumb to realize by yourself. We\\'ve taught everyone to hate crime and\\n criminals ... to\\nhate\\nthem as nothing has ever been hated before.\\n Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell\\n if you don\\'t leave New York. You should go to some small town where\\n there aren\\'t many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or—\"\\n\\n\\n Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \"\\nFavor\\n, did you say? The day you\\n do\\nme\\na favor—\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I\\n want to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read\\n books. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I couldn\\'t leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I\\'m flat broke. Thanks to\\n your CPA system, a DCT can\\'t get a decent job.\"\\nHendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extended\\n them. \"I\\'ll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back a\\n little at a time.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don\\'t you do me a favor? Why\\n don\\'t you frame me? If I\\'m such a nuisance, pin a crime on me—any\\n crime.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn\\'t commit is a\\n violation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Umm.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn\\'t\\nhave\\nto\\n be a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your\\n criminal tendencies and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go to those\\nhead-shrinkers\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can\\'t you\\nmake\\nme go?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Violation of Civil Rights.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same\\n thing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks\\n walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.\\n \"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New\\n York who aren\\'t properly protected. Every week we find people who\\n aren\\'t protected properly—blind spots in our protection devices. As\\n soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,\\n but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.\\n\\n\\n \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can\\n I do? I can\\'t hold this book in front of your nose and say, \\'Here, Joe,\\n pick a name and go out and rob him.\\'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did\\n that, I\\'d be committing a crime myself!\"\\n\\n\\n He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket\\n again and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I\\'m dying of\\n thirst. There\\'s a water cooler in the next room.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the\\n big man. Hendricks was—unbelievably—offering him a victim, offering\\n him a crime!\\n\\n\\n Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and\\n address and memorized it:\\nJohn Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.\\nWhen Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn\\'t do anything.\"\\nWhen Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a\\n child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn\\'t afraid\\n of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\\n at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\\n own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn\\'t shrug the\\n feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\\n him to make a mistake.\\n\\n\\n Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\\n Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\\n alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\\n for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\\n up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\\n\\n\\n If the words \"Let\\'s see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\\n were discarded. But if the words \"Let\\'s roll this guy\" were received,\\n the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\\n in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\\n microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\\n to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\\n someone\\'s pocket at forty yards.\\n\\n\\n Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\\n store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\\n of business for years.\\n\\n\\n Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors—devices\\n placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\\n heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\\n made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\\n poison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\\n of it would kill a human.\\n\\n\\n The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\\n supervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\\n of kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\\n pointless. A counterfeiter\\'s career was always short-lived: every place\\n of business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\\n that could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\\n\\n\\n And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\\n of the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\\n that he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\\n different: they weren\\'t flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\\n their aim was infallible.\\nIt was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn\\'t\\n fantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered across\\n the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously\\n low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power\\n required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of\\n four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of\\n the devices had cost even less.\\n\\n\\n And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at\\n the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked\\n subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio\\n or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he\\n invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.\\n If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters\\n declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he\\n always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn\\'t fit\\n anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.\\n\\n\\n It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and\\n heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his\\n subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime\\n was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.\\n\\n\\n Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands\\n of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment\\n 204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he\\'d inherited a gold mine.\\n\\n\\n The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204,\\n he could see that the wall on either side of it was\\nnew\\n. That is,\\n instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls\\n were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and\\n the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating\\n another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by\\n law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but\\n evidently he didn\\'t want to pay for installation.\\n\\n\\n When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to\\n close the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the\\n bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at\\n night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.\\n\\n\\n Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the\\n crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.\\nHe broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old\\n magazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a\\n crime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of\\n being respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.\\n\\n\\n He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear.\\n The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn\\'t run,\\n but—perfection itself—engraved on the back was the inscription,\\nTo\\n John with Love\\n. His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy\\n for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.\\n\\n\\n Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \"\\nThief! Police!\\n Help!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a\\n police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him;\\n cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.\\n\\n\\n When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the\\n metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who\\n reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.\\nHe was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, \"Hey. Wake up. Hey!\"\\n\\n\\n He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks\\' ugly face and thought for a minute\\n he was still having the nightmare.\\n\\n\\n \"I just saw your doctor,\" Hendricks said. \"He says your treatment is\\n over. You can go home now. I thought I\\'d give you a lift.\"\\n\\n\\n As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.\\n\\n\\n During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to\\n think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in\\n himself.\\n\\n\\n He felt more relaxed than he\\'d ever felt before, but that could be an\\n after-effect of all the sedatives he\\'d been given. And, he noticed when\\n he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months\\n and he had, between operations, been locked in his room.\\n\\n\\n Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back.\\n Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change:\\n Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now,\\n even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred.\\n They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it\\n altogether.\\n\\n\\n \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks.\\n\\n\\n Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered\\n on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks,\\n cameramen and autograph hunters. He\\'d waited a long time for this day.\\n But now—another change in him—\\n\\n\\n He put the emotion into words: \"I don\\'t feel like a hero. Funny, but I\\n don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded\\n like a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You\\n stupid—\"\\n\\n\\n He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think\\n those people are down there because they admire what you did? They\\'re\\n down there waiting for you because they\\'re curious, because they\\'re\\n glad the CPA caught you, and because they\\'re glad you\\'re an Ex. You\\'re\\n an\\nex\\n-criminal now, and because of your treatment, you\\'ll never be\\n able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that\\'s the kind\\n of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get\\n your autograph.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe didn\\'t understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did\\n understand he didn\\'t believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see\\n the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they\\'d cheer\\n and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn\\'t a hero,\\nwhat was\\n he\\n?\\nIt took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all\\n around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at\\n once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered\\n some more.\\n\\n\\n Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired\\n old lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a\\n watch. Thank heaven you didn\\'t kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And\\n then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total\\n confusion.\\n\\n\\n What she said didn\\'t make sense. If he had killed someone rather\\n than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd\\n would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA\\n hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an\\n ex-murderer came out.\\n\\n\\n In Hendricks\\' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled\\n himself with the thought,\\nPeople are funny. Who can understand \\'em?\\nFeeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward\\n Hendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I\\'ll\\n be able to get a good job now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to\\n explain some things. I\\'ve known you for a long time and I know you\\'re\\n spectacularly dumb. You can\\'t figure out some things for yourself and\\n I don\\'t want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did\\n you a favor.\"\\n\\n\\n Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely\\n thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who\\'d\\n done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!\\n\\n\\n \"You robbed Gralewski\\'s apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA\\n employee and he doesn\\'t live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays\\n the rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places\\n like that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you\\n before they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First\\n Class won\\'t take the free psycho treatment or—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, it\\'s still a favor.\"\\n\\n\\n Hendricks\\' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn\\'t know a favor if you\\n stumbled over one. I did it because it\\'s standard procedure for your\\n type of case. Anyone can—free of charge—have treatment by the best\\n psychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the\\n treatment and taking it. But you wouldn\\'t do that. You wanted to commit\\n a crime, get caught and be a hero ... an\\nEx\\n.\"\\nThe car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages\\n were laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA\\n psychologists to relieve tension. And—despite the treatment, Joe\\n shuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly\\n watching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees\\n and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly\\n watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies,\\n it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply\\n until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it\\n wanted you to be.\\n\\n\\n \"Being an Ex, you\\'ll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks\\n continued. \"You\\'ll get a good-paying job, but you\\'ll work for it.\\n You\\'ll work eight hours a day, work harder than you\\'ve ever worked\\n before in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in\\n your head is going to say,\\nWork! Work!\\nExes always get good jobs\\n because employers know they\\'re good workers.\\n\\n\\n \"But during these next few days, you\\'ll discover what being an Ex\\n is like. You see, Joe, the treatment can\\'t possibly take all the\\n criminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best\\n thing—you\\'ll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might\\nwant\\nto break one now and then, but you won\\'t be able. I\\'ll give you an\\n illustration....\"\\n\\n\\n Joe\\'s face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of\\n names. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in\\n his arm froze before it moved it an inch.\\n\\n\\n And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so\\n intense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in\\n agony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head,\\nUnlawful to\\n strike someone except in self-defense\\n.\\n\\n\\n He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him,\\n the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain\\n returned, and the mental voice whispered,\\nUnlawful to curse\\n.\\n\\n\\n He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a\\n crime. And now that he knew, it didn\\'t seem fair. He decided to tell\\n the whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon as\\n that decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and\\n the voice,\\nUnlawful to divulge CPA procedure\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"See what I mean?\" Hendricks asked. \"A century ago, you would have been\\n locked in a prison and taxpayers\\' money would have supported you until\\n the day you died. With the CPA system, you\\'re returned to society, a\\n useful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you\\'ve got a\\n big hand in your dirty little mind that\\'s going to slap it every time\\n you get the wrong kind of thought. It\\'ll keep slapping you until you\\n learn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you\\'ll learn sooner\\n or later to not even think about doing anything wrong.\"\\nHe lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car\\'s plush ceiling.\\n \"It\\'s a great system, isn\\'t it, Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk like\\n you is free to do what he wants, as long as it\\'s legal.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think it\\'s a lousy, filthy system.\" Joe\\'s head was still tingling\\n with pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it\\n was also inside his head, telling him he couldn\\'t do this, couldn\\'t do\\n that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn\\'t do things he\\n wanted to do and\\nnow\\n....\\n\\n\\n Hendricks laughed. \"You\\'ll change your opinion. We live in a clean,\\n wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for\\n freaks like yourself, criminals are—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me out!\" Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming\\n the door behind him before the car stopped completely.\\n\\n\\n He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into\\n the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a\\n prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated\\n him back.\\n\\n\\n He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and\\n voice prevented him.\\n\\n\\n It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Mothers had a way\\n of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better\\n off without them. Martin was no exception. He\\'d never had it this\\n good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin\\n had never had one. He\\'d been a war baby, born of one of the tides of\\n soldiers—enemies and allies, both—that had engulfed the country in\\n successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble\\n that way.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story\\n about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really\\n was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell\\n him to call her \"\\nAunt Ninian\\n\"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he\\'d\\n been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he\\'d thought\\n maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little\\n too crazy for that.\\n\\n\\n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer\\n with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry\\n instead of mopping up the floor with him.\\n\\n\\n \"But I can\\'t understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why\\n do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin\\n Conrad?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because he\\'s coming to kill you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why should he kill me? I ain\\'t done him nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n Ninian sighed. \"He\\'s dissatisfied with the current social order and\\n killing you is part of an elaborate plan he\\'s formulated to change it.\\n You wouldn\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re damn right. I\\ndon\\'t\\nunderstand. What\\'s it all about in\\n straight gas?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, just don\\'t ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you\\n get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\"\\nSo Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the\\n way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he\\n knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to\\n think it was disgusting.\\n\\n\\n \"So if you don\\'t like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\\n\\n\\n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\\n\\n\\n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\\n\\n\\n And darned if that dope didn\\'t go out and get a woman to come clean up\\n the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn\\'t even dare show his face in\\n the streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding\\n to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew\\n how to give them the cold shoulder.\\n\\n\\n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn\\'t been coming\\n to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very\\n regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn\\'t know that and\\n she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and\\n would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so\\n hard inside.\\n\\n\\n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and\\n hired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin\\n had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step\\n without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\\n\\n\\n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn\\'t that she cared what these people\\n thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little\\n better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There\\n were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the\\n same way, only she didn\\'t know that, either. She was really pretty\\n dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s so hard to think these things out without any prior practical\\n application to go by,\" she told him.\\n\\n\\n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out\\n wrong. But he didn\\'t try to help her; he just watched to see what\\n she\\'d do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a\\n spectator.\\n\\n\\n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,\\n Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that\\n mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where\\n intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\\n\\n\\n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she\\n declared. \"Besides, it\\'s easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\\n\\n\\n And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who\\n came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle\\n Raymond.\\n\\n\\n From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and\\n Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many\\n more—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.\\nMartin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn\\'t allowed to play\\n with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents\\n would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if\\n a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be\\n something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as\\n conspicuous as before. But he didn\\'t tip her off. She was grown up; she\\n was supposed to know better than he did.\\n\\n\\n He lived well. He had food to eat that he\\'d never dreamed of before,\\n warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by\\n more luxury than he knew what to do with.\\n\\n\\n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There\\n were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every\\n inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls\\n were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time\\n and a freezer well stocked with food—somewhat erratically chosen, for\\n Ninian didn\\'t know much about meals.\\n\\n\\n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a\\n neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\\n\\n\\n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other\\n kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn\\'t given\\n him enough to eat and she\\'d beaten him up so hard sometimes that she\\'d\\n nearly killed him—but then there had also been times when she\\'d hugged\\n and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She\\'d done all\\n she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if\\n respectable society didn\\'t like it, the hell with respectable society.\\n\\n\\n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.\\n They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry\\n out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,\\n in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a\\n world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the\\n government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to\\n think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than\\n actually doing anything with the hands.\\n\\n\\n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;\\n everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear\\n pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was\\n no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of\\n normal living.\\n\\n\\n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of\\n them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.\\n They came from the future.\\nWhen Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\\n promised five years before.\\n\\n\\n \"The whole thing\\'s all my brother Conrad\\'s fault. You see, he\\'s an\\n idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\\n\\n\\n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\\n rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\\n store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\\n and he\\'d read so much that he\\'d weakened his eyes and had to wear\\n glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\\n and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\\n carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\\n\\n\\n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\\n the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\\n continued. \"Which\\nis\\ndistressing—though, of course, it\\'s not as\\n if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\\n passing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that,\\n and I\\'m sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\\n Conrad is so impatient.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\\n snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that\\'s all.\\n But remember, our interests are identical. We\\'re virtually the same\\n people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\\n years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\\n understand that we can\\'t make machinery without metal. We need food.\\n All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\\n worlds, it\\'s far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\\n expensive machinery. After all, if we didn\\'t give the natives jobs, how\\n would they manage to live?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don\\'t work, how\\n do\\nyou\\nlive now?... I don\\'t mean in the now for me, but the now for\\n you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the\\n past and think in the future.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but\\n if you will persist in these childish interruptions—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry,\" Martin said.\\n\\n\\n But he wasn\\'t, for by now he had little respect left for any of\\n his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\\n young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\\n considerable self-confidence, but they just weren\\'t very bright. And\\n he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\\n lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more\\n frightening—his race had lost something vital.\\n\\n\\n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\\n Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\\n feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn\\'t been for\\n the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\\n might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling\\n guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\\n great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\\n accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn\\'t help asking.\\nRaymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this\\n or don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for\\n himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\\n\\n\\n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time\\n transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally\\n officious—always inventing such senseless things. It\\'s supposed to\\n be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always\\n desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\\n\\n\\n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas\\'\\n assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad\\'s idea had been to go back\\n in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,\\n there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never\\n get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\\n\\n\\n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\\n\\n\\n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It\\'s the\\nadolescent\\nway,\" he said, \"to do\\n away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole\\n society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, there\\'s your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps\\n he built it himself. One doesn\\'t inquire too closely into such\\n matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn\\'t bear the idea\\n of eliminating our great-grandfather—because our great-grandfather\\n was such a\\ngood\\nman, you know.\" Raymond\\'s expressive upper lip\\n curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of\\n his great-grandfather\\'s father—who\\'d been, by all accounts, a pretty\\n worthless character.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\\n\\n\\n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn\\'t that just go to prove you\\n mustn\\'t believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in\\n a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us—the other\\n cousins and me—held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it\\n was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He\\n beamed at Martin.\\n\\n\\n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in\\neliminating\\nme, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\\n\\n\\n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn\\'t really\\n suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer\\n altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the\\n cousins possessed to a consternating degree.\\nMartin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long\\n ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\\n\\n\\n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor\\'s\\n assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\\n \"and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\\nInduced\\n, Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the\\n use of the iron maiden.\\n\\n\\n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you\\n night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made\\n our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here\\n we are!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" Martin said.\\n\\n\\n Raymond didn\\'t seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed\\n out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good\\n thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary\\n conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don\\'t see what more you\\n could ask for. You\\'re getting the best of all possible worlds. Of\\n course Ninian\\nwas\\na ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any\\n little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our\\n era has completely disposed of the mercantiles—\"\\n\\n\\n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\\n\\n\\n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I\\'m in full charge,\\n we\\'ll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.\\n Ostentation—that\\'s the way to live here and now; the richer you are,\\n the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might\\n as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this\\n wretched historical stint.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So Ninian\\'s going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel\\n curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a\\n remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in\\n exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer\\n than yours. Besides, you\\'re getting too old now to be under petticoat\\n government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You\\'re not going to\\n go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we\\n aren\\'t very close, so it won\\'t make a real difference.\" That was the\\n sad part: he already knew it wouldn\\'t make a difference.\\n\\n\\n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren\\'t a sloppy\\n sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,\\n you know.\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring\\n of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to\\n protect me when he comes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said\\n with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child\\'s\\n combination spaceman\\'s gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no\\n doubt, was a perfectly genuine—and lethal—weapon. \"And we\\'ve got a\\n rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\\n\\n\\n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring\\n which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was\\n dubious. \"Maybe it\\'ll work on someone coming from outside this\\nhouse\\n,\\n but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this\\ntime\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never fear—it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory\\n guarantee and all that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I\\'d better have\\n one of those guns, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that\\n myself!\"\\nWhen it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at\\n her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\\n at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\\n him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\\n cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\\n that she\\'d come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\\n very last.\\n\\n\\n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\\n site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\\n dozen years later, they weren\\'t touched. Martin was never sure whether\\n this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\\n descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\\n\\n\\n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\\n Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\\n convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\\n carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\\n from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\\n Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\\n dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—\"architecturally\\n dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\\n typical\"—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\\n aquarium.\\n\\n\\n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\\n go with a castle.\"\\n\"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\\n seem safer somehow.\"\\n\\n\\n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\\n nervous. He got Raymond\\'s permission to take two suits of armor that\\n stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\\n several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\\n the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\\n until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\\n\\n\\n During those early years, Martin\\'s tutors were exchanged for the\\n higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\\n arose of what the youth\\'s vocation in that life was going to be. At\\n least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\\n their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\\n such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\\n entertainment.\\n\"This sort of problem wouldn\\'t arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond\\n commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,\\n unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one\\n just—well, drifts along happily.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we\\n could take you there. I\\'m sure you would like it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you\\n made up your mind what you want to be?\"\\n\\n\\n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\\n \"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don\\'t\\n know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.\\n Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might\\n invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from\\n particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,\\n to be perfectly frank, I can\\'t quite understand how.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over\\n again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\\n\\n\\n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.\\n Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of\\n their times.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn\\'t make much\\n difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\\n\\n\\n Martin couldn\\'t hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that\\n other time?\"\\n\\n\\n There was a chilly silence.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let\\'s just be\\n thankful we\\'ve saved you from\\nthat\\n!\"\\n\\n\\n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent\\n second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first\\n rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost\\n purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was\\n fear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and\\n walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for\\n the sake of an ideal.\\n\\n\\n But the fear did not show in Martin\\'s pictures. They were pretty\\n pictures.\\nCousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\\n descendants\\ncousin\\n—next assumed guardianship. Ives took his\\n responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\\n to have Martin\\'s work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\\n critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\\n sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\\n interested.\\n\\n\\n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they\\'ll be buying\\n your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\\n\\n\\n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\\n as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\\n man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\\n change of air and scenery.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Course you can\\'t go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn\\'t invented\\n space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What\\'s left of it.\\n Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n So he drew on the family\\'s vast future resources and bought a yacht,\\n which Martin christened\\nThe Interregnum\\n. They traveled about from sea\\n to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\\n trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the\\n nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\\n same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\\n museum; he couldn\\'t seem to identify with his own time any more.\\n\\n\\n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\\n largely because they could spend so much time far away from the\\n contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\\n they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\\nThe Interregnum\\n. He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\\n there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\\n time.\\n\\n\\n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\\n they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\\n ship, giving each other parties and playing an\\navant-garde\\nform of\\n shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\\n ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\\n having got advance information about the results.\\n\\n\\n Martin didn\\'t care much for their company and associated with them only\\n when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\\n they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn\\'t court\\n his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\\nHe rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\\n together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\\n from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\\n accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\\n proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\\n left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\\n interbred aristocracy, to which Martin\\'s descendants belonged by virtue\\n of their distinguished ancestry.\\n\\n\\n \"Rather feudal, isn\\'t it?\" Martin asked.\\n\\n\\n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\\n planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\\n Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\\n deported.\\n\\n\\n \"Not only natives livin\\' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\\n of them stood at the ship\\'s rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\\n of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\\n for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\\n regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\\n himself. \"Maybe it\\nis\\nworse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\\n for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren\\'t any more.\\n Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested,\\n even.\\n\\n\\n \"Sometimes I\\'m not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after\\n a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the\\n people—I expect you could call them people—there. Still—\" he smiled\\n shamefacedly—\"couldn\\'t stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,\\n could I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\\n\\n\\n \"Would take moral courage. I don\\'t have it. None of us does, except\\n Conrad, and even he—\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better\\n way out than Conrad\\'s,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything\\n will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything,\\n if it doesn\\'t.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\\n\\n\\n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn\\'t hope; he couldn\\'t feel; he\\n couldn\\'t even seem to care.\\n\\n\\n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin\\n had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\\n wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\\n But he didn\\'t come. And Martin got to thinking....\\n\\n\\n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\\n the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\\n been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\\n bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\\n the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\\n take a medical degree—but he wasn\\'t able to save Ives. The body was\\n buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\\n continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\\n\\n\\n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were\\n dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond\\n read the burial service, because they didn\\'t dare summon a clerical\\n cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\\n about the entire undertaking.\\n\\n\\n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\\n Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\\n\\n\\n But Martin disagreed.\\nThe ceaseless voyaging began again.\\nThe Interregnum\\nvoyaged to every\\n ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\\n a while, Martin couldn\\'t tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\\n came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\\n apart as the different oceans.\\nAll the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\\n his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\\n the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\\n their elders.\\n\\n\\n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\\n in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\\n for fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that\\n era than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore,\\n and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\\n the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and\\n sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\\n that his other work lacked.\\n\\n\\n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\\n somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\\n he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\\n journey. He\\'d come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\\n purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\\n cousin\\'s utter disgust.\\n\\n\\n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\\n do,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\\n scraping bottom now—advised.\\n\\n\\n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\\n disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\\n purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\\n However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\\n and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\\n understand.\\n\\n\\n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\\n the current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.\\n\\n\\n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad\\'s\\n a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He\\'s biding his time—waiting\\n until we\\'re off guard. And then—pow!—he\\'ll attack!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\\n\\n\\n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\\n member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\\n ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\\n conversation, anyhow.\\n\\n\\n \"When he does show up, I\\'ll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\\n his ray gun. \"You haven\\'t a thing to worry about.\"\\n\\n\\n Martin smiled with all the charm he\\'d had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\\n have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\\n given up carrying a gun long ago.\\n\\n\\n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\\nThe Interregnum\\nvoyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\\n out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel\\n and man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\\n time.\\nThe Interregnum\\nroamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\\n passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\\n bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But\\n \\npleasing  a customer should have its limits!\\nThe Christmas party at the Boston branch of Hartshorne-Logan was\\n threatening to become more legendary than usual this Christmas.\\n\\n\\n The farm machinery manager had already collapsed. When he slid under\\n the table containing the drinks, Miss Pringle, who sold millinery, had\\n screamed: \"He\\'ll drown!\"\\n\\n\\n One out of every three dirty stories started by party attendees had\\n remained unfinished, because each had reminded someone else of another\\n story.\\n\\n\\n The recently developed liquors which affected the bloodstream three\\n times faster had driven away twinges of conscience about untrimmed\\n trees and midnight church services.\\n\\n\\n The star salesman for mankies and the gentleman who was in charge of\\n the janitors were putting on a display of Burmese foot-wrestling in\\n one corner of the general office. The janitor foreman weighed fifty\\n pounds less than the Burma gentleman, who was the salesman\\'s customary\\n opponent. So the climax of one tactic did not simply overturn the\\n foreman. He glided through the air, crashing with a very loud thump\\n against the wall.\\n\\n\\n He wasn\\'t hurt. But the impact knocked the hallowed portrait of H. H.\\n Hartshorne, co-founder, from its nail. It tinkled imposingly as its\\n glass splintered against the floor.\\nThe noise caused a temporary lull in the gaiety. Several employes even\\n felt a passing suspicion that things might be getting out of hand.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s all in the spirit of good, clean fun!\" cried Mr. Hawkins, the\\n assistant general manager. Since he was the highest executive present,\\n worries vanished. Everyone felt fine. There was a scurry to shove the\\n broken glass out of sight and to turn more attention to another type of\\n glasses.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Hawkins himself, acting by reflex, attempted to return the portrait\\n to its place until new glass could be obtained. But the fall had sprung\\n the frame at one corner and it wouldn\\'t hang straight.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'d better put old H. H. away for safekeeping until after the\\n holiday,\" he told a small, blonde salesclerk who was beneath his\\n attention on any working day.\\n\\n\\n With the proper mixture of respect and bonhommie, he lifted the heavy\\n picture out of its frame. A yellowed envelope slipped to the floor as\\n the picture came free. Hawkins rolled the picture like a scroll and put\\n it into a desk drawer, for later attention. Then he looked around for a\\n drink that would make him feel even better.\\n\\n\\n A sorting clerk in the mail order department wasn\\'t used to liquor. She\\n picked up the envelope and looked around vaguely for the mail-opening\\n machine.\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Milly, you aren\\'t working!\" someone shouted at her. \"Have\\n another!\"\\n\\n\\n Milly snapped out of it. She giggled, suppressed a ladylike belch and\\n returned to reality. Looking at the envelope, she said: \"Oh, I see.\\n They must have stuck it in to tighten the frame. Gee, it\\'s old.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Hawkins had refreshed himself. He decided that he liked Milly\\'s\\n voice. To hear more of it, he said to her: \"I\\'ll bet that\\'s been in\\n there ever since the picture was framed. There\\'s a company legend that\\n that picture was put up the day this branch opened, eighty years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t know the company ever used buff envelopes like this.\" Milly\\n turned it over in her hands. The ancient glue crackled as she did so.\\n The flap popped open and an old-fashioned order blank fell out.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Hawkins\\' eyes widened. He bent, reached painfully over his potbelly\\n and picked up the order form.\\n\\n\\n \"This thing has never been processed!\" Raising his voice, he shouted\\n jovially, \"Hey, people! You\\'re all fired! Here\\'s an order that\\n Hartshorne-Logan never filled! We can\\'t have such carelessness. This\\n poor woman has waited eighty years for her merchandise!\"\\nMilly was reading aloud the scrawled words on the order form:\\n\\n\\n \"Best electric doorbell. Junior detective kit. Disposable sacks for\\n vacuum cleaner. Dress for three-year-old girl.\" She turned to the\\n assistant general manager, struck with an idea for the first time in\\n her young life. \"Let\\'s fill this order right now!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The poor woman must be dead by now,\" he objected, secretly angry\\n that he hadn\\'t thought of such a fine party stunt himself. Then he\\n brightened. \"Unless—\" he said it loud enough for the employes to scent\\n a great proposal and the room grew quiet—\"unless we broke the rules\\n just once and used the time warp on a big mission!\"\\n\\n\\n There was a silence. Finally, from an anonymous voice in one corner:\\n \"Would the warp work over eighty years? We were always told that it\\n must be used only for complaints within three days.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then let\\'s find out!\" Mr. Hawkins downed the rest of his drink and\\n pulled a batch of keys from his pocket. \"Someone scoot down to the\\n warehouse. Tell the watchman that it\\'s on my authority. Hunt up the\\n stuff that\\'s on the order. Get the best of everything. Ignore the\\n catalogue numbers—they\\'ve changed a hundred times in all these years.\"\\n\\n\\n Milly was still deciphering the form. Now she let out a little squeal\\n of excitement.\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Mr. Hawkins! The name on this order—it\\'s my great-grandmother!\\n Isn\\'t that wonderful? I was just a little girl when she died. I can\\n barely remember her as a real old woman. But I remember that my\\n grandmother never bought anything from Hartshorne-Logan because of some\\n trouble her mother had once with the firm. My mother didn\\'t want me to\\n come to work here because of that.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Hawkins put his arm around Milly in a way that he intended to\\n look fatherly. It didn\\'t. \"Well, now. Since it\\'s your relative, let\\'s\\n thrill the old girl. We wouldn\\'t have vacuum sacks any more. So we\\'ll\\n substitute a manky!\"\\nAnn Hartley was returning from mailing the letter when she found the\\n large parcel on her doorstep. She put her hands on her hips and stared\\n pugnaciously at the bundle.\\n\\n\\n \"The minute I write a letter to complain about you, you turn up!\" she\\n told the parcel. She nudged her toe peevishly against the brown paper\\n wrappings that were tied with a half-transparent twine she had never\\n seen before.\\n\\n\\n The label was addressed in a wandering scrawl, a sharp contrast to\\n the impersonal typing on the customary Hartshorne-Logan bundles. But\\n the familiar RATTLE OK sticker was pasted onto the box, indicating to\\n the delivery man that the contents would make a rattling sound and\\n therefore hadn\\'t been broken in shipment.\\n\\n\\n Ann sighed and picked up her bundle. With a last look at the lovely\\n spring afternoon and the quiet suburban landscape, she went into the\\n house.\\n\\n\\n Two-year-old Sally heard the box rattling. She waddled up on chubby\\n legs and grabbed her mother\\'s skirt. \"Want!\" she said decisively.\\n\\n\\n \"Your dress ought to be here,\" Ann said. She found scissors in her\\n sewing box, tossed a cushion onto the floor, sat on it, and began to\\n open the parcel.\\n\\n\\n \"Now I\\'ll have to write another letter to explain that they should\\n throw away my letter of complaint,\" she told her daughter. \"And by the\\n time they get my second letter, they\\'ll have answered my first letter.\\n Then they\\'ll write again.\" Out of consideration for Sally, she omitted\\n the expletives that she wanted to add.\\n\\n\\n The translucent cord was too tough for the scissors. Ann was about to\\n hunt for a razor blade when Sally clutched at an intersection of the\\n cord and yanked. The twine sprang away from the carton as if it were\\n alive. The paper wrappings flapped open.\\n\\n\\n \"There!\" Sally said.\\n\\n\\n Ann repressed an irrational urge to slap her daughter. Instead, she\\n tossed the wrappings aside and removed the lid from the carton. A\\n slightly crushed thin cardboard box lay on top. Ann pulled out the\\n dress and shook it into a freely hanging position. Then she groaned.\\n\\n\\n It was green and she had ordered blue. It didn\\'t remotely resemble\\n the dress she had admired from the Hartshorne-Logan catalogue\\n illustration. Moreover, the shoulders were lumpier than any small\\n girl\\'s dress should be.\\n\\n\\n But Sally was delighted. \"Mine!\" she shrilled, grabbing for the dress.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s probably the wrong size, too,\" Ann said, pulling off Sally\\'s\\n dress to try it on. \"Let\\'s find as many things to complain about as we\\n can.\"\\nThe dress fitted precisely, except for the absurd shoulder bumps. Sally\\n was radiant for a moment. Then her small face sobered and she started\\n to look vacantly at the distant wall.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll have to send it back,\" Ann said, \"and get the one we ordered.\"\\n\\n\\n She tried to take it off, but the child squawked violently. Ann grabbed\\n her daughter\\'s arms, held them above her head and pulled at the dress.\\n It seemed to be stuck somewhere. When Ann released the child\\'s arms to\\n loosen the dress, Sally squirmed away. She took one step forward, then\\n began to float three inches above the ground. She landed just before\\n she collided with the far wall.\\nSally looked scared until she saw her mother\\'s face. Then she squealed\\n in delight.\\n\\n\\n Ann\\'s legs were rubber. She was shaking her head and wobbling\\n uncertainly toward her daughter when the door opened behind her.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s me,\" her husband said. \"Slow day at the office, so I came home\\n early.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Les! I\\'m going crazy or something. Sally just—\"\\n\\n\\n Sally crouched to jump at her father. Before she could leap, he grabbed\\n her up bodily and hugged her. Then he saw the box.\\n\\n\\n \"Your order\\'s here? Good. What\\'s this thing?\" He was looking at a small\\n box he had pulled from the carton. Its lid contained a single word:\\n MANKY. The box rattled when he shook it.\\n\\n\\n Les pulled off the lid and found inside a circular, shiny metal object.\\n A triangular trio of jacks stuck out from one end.\\n\\n\\n \"Is this the doorbell? I\\'ve never seen a plug like this. And there\\'s no\\n wire.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know,\" Ann said. \"Les, listen. A minute ago, Sally—\"\\n\\n\\n He peered into the box for an instruction sheet, uselessly. \"They must\\n have made a mistake. It looks like some kind of farm equipment.\"\\n\\n\\n He tossed the manky onto the hassock and delved into the carton again.\\n Sally was still in his arms.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s the doorbell, I think,\" he said, looking at the next object. It\\n had a lovely, tubular shape, a half-dozen connecting rods and a plug\\n for a wall socket.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s funny,\" Ann mused, her mind distracted from Sally for a moment.\\n \"It looks terribly expensive. Maybe they sent door chimes instead of\\n the doorbell.\"\\n\\n\\n The bottom of the carton contained the detective outfit that they had\\n ordered for their son. Ann glanced at its glaringly lithographed cover\\n and said: \"Les, about Sally. Put her down a minute and watch what she\\n does.\"\\nLes stared at his wife and put the child onto the rug. Sally began to\\n walk, then rose and again floated, this time toward the hassock on\\n which the manky lay.\\n\\n\\n His jaw dropped. \"My God! Ann, what—\"\\n\\n\\n Ann was staring, too, but not at her daughter. \"Les! The hassock! It\\n used to be brown!\"\\n\\n\\n The hassock was a livid shade of green. A neon, demanding, screaming\\n green that clashed horribly with the soft browns and reds in which Ann\\n had furnished the room.\\n\\n\\n \"That round thing must be leaking,\" Les said. \"But did you see Sally\\n when she—\"\\n\\n\\n Ann\\'s frazzled nerves carried a frantic order to her muscles. She\\n jumped up, strode to the hassock and picked up the manky with two\\n fingers. She tossed it to Les. Immediately, she regretted her action.\\n\\n\\n \"Drop it!\" she yelled. \"Maybe it\\'ll turn you green, too!\"\\n\\n\\n Les kicked the hassock into the hall closet, tossed the manky in after\\n it and shut the door firmly. As the door closed, he saw the entire\\n interior of the dark closet brighten into a wet-lettuce green.\\n\\n\\n When he turned back to Ann, she was staring at her left hand. The\\n wedding band that Les had put there a dozen years ago was a brilliant\\n green, shedding its soft glow over the finger up to the first knuckle.\\n\\n\\n Ann felt the scream building up inside her. She opened her mouth to let\\n it out, then put her hand in front of her mouth to keep it in, finally\\n jerked the hand away to prevent the glowing ring from turning her front\\n teeth green.\\n\\n\\n She collapsed into Les\\'s arms, babbling incomprehensibly.\\n\\n\\n He said: \"It\\'s all right. There must be balloons or something in the\\n shoulders of that dress. I\\'ll tie a paperweight to Sally\\'s dress and\\n that\\'ll hold her down until we undress her. Don\\'t worry. And that green\\n dye or whatever it is will wash off.\"\\n\\n\\n Ann immediately felt better. She put her hands behind her back, pulled\\n off her ring and slipped it into her apron pocket. Les was sentimental\\n about her removing it.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll get dinner,\" she said, trying to keep her voice on an even keel.\\n \"Maybe you\\'d better start a letter to Hartshorne-Logan. Let\\'s go into\\n the kitchen, Sally.\"\\n\\n\\n Ann strode resolutely toward the rear of the house. She kept her eyes\\n determinedly off the tinge of green that was showing through the apron\\n pocket and didn\\'t dare look back at her daughter\\'s unsettling means of\\n propulsion.\\nA half-hour later, when the meal was almost ready, two things happened:\\n Bob came home from school through the back door and a strange voice\\n said from the front of the house, \"Don\\'t answer the front door.\"\\n\\n\\n Ann stared at her son. He stared back at her, the detective outfit\\n under his arm.\\n\\n\\n She went into the front room. Her husband was standing with fists on\\n hips, looking at the front door, chuckling. \"Neatest trick I\\'ve seen\\n in a long time. That voice you heard was the new doorbell. I put it up\\n while you were in the kitchen. Did you hear what happened when old lady\\n Burnett out there pushed the button?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh. Something like those name cards with something funny printed on\\n them, like \\'Another hour shot.\\' Well, if there\\'s a little tape in there\\n repeating that message, you\\'d better shut that part off. It might get\\n boring after a while. And it might insult someone.\"\\n\\n\\n Ann went to the door and turned the knob. The door didn\\'t open. The\\n figure of Mrs. Burnett, half-visible through the heavy curtain, shifted\\n impatiently on the porch.\\n\\n\\n Les yanked at the doorknob. It didn\\'t yield for him, either. He looked\\n up at the doorbell, which he had installed just above the upper part\\n of the door frame.\\n\\n\\n \"Queer,\" he said. \"That isn\\'t in contact with the door itself. I don\\'t\\n see how it can keep the door from opening.\"\\n\\n\\n Ann put her mouth close to the glass, shouting: \"Won\\'t you come to the\\n back door, Mrs. Burnett? This one is stuck.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I just wanted to borrow some sugar,\" the woman cried from the porch.\\n \"I realize that I\\'m a terrible bother.\" But she walked down the front\\n steps and disappeared around the side of the house.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t open the back door.\" The well-modulated voice from the small\\n doorbell box threatened to penetrate every corner of the house. Ann\\n looked doubtfully at her husband\\'s lips. They weren\\'t moving.\\n\\n\\n \"If this is ventriloquism—\" she began icily.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll have to order another doorbell just like this one, for the\\n office,\" Les said. \"But you\\'d better let the old girl in. No use\\n letting her get peeved.\"\\n\\n\\n The back door was already open, because it was a warm day. The screen\\n door had no latch, held closed by a simple spring. Ann pushed it open\\n when Mrs. Burnett waddled up the three back steps, and smiled at her\\n neighbor.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m so sorry you had to walk around the house. It\\'s been a rather\\n hectic day in an awful lot of ways.\"\\nSomething seemed to impede Mrs. Burnett as she came to the threshold.\\n She frowned and shoved her portly frame against something invisible.\\n It apparently yielded abruptly, because she staggered forward into\\n the kitchen, nearly falling. She stared grimly at Ann and looked\\n suspiciously behind her.\\n\\n\\n \"The children have some new toys,\" Ann improvised hastily. \"Sally is\\n so excited over a new dress that she\\'s positively feverish. Let\\'s see\\n now—it was sugar that you want, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I already have it,\" Bob said, handing a filled cup to his mother.\\n The boy turned back to the detective set which he had spread over the\\n kitchen table.\\n\\n\\n \"Excitement isn\\'t good for me,\" Mrs. Burnett said testily. \"I\\'ve had a\\n lot of troubles in my life. I like peace and quiet.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your husband is better?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Worse. I\\'m sure I don\\'t know why everything happens to me.\" Mrs.\\n Burnett edged toward the hall, trying to peer into the front of the\\n house. Ann stood squarely in front of the door leading to the hall.\\n Defeated, Mrs. Burnett left. A muffled volley of handclapping, mixed\\n with a few faint cheers, came from the doorbell-box when she crossed\\n the threshold.\\n\\n\\n Ann went into the hall to order Les to disconnect the doorbell. She\\n nearly collided with him, coming in the other direction.\\n\\n\\n \"Where did this come from?\" Les held a small object in the palm of\\n his hand, keeping it away from his body. A few drops of something\\n unpleasant were dripping from his fingers. The object looked remarkably\\n like a human eyeball. It was human-size, complete with pupil, iris and\\n rather bloodshot veins.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, that\\'s mine,\" Bob said. \"You know, this is a funny detective kit.\\n That was in it. But there aren\\'t instructions on how it works.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, put it away,\" Ann told Bob sharply. \"It\\'s slimy.\"\\n\\n\\n Les laid the eyeball on the table and walked away. The eyeball rolled\\n from the smooth, level table, bounced twice when it hit the floor, then\\n rolled along, six inches behind him. He turned and kicked at it. The\\n eyeball rolled nimbly out of the path of the kick.\\n\\n\\n \"Les, I think we\\'ve made poor Mrs. Burnett angry,\" Ann said. \"She\\'s so\\n upset over her poor husband\\'s health and she thinks we\\'re insulting\\n her.\"\\n\\n\\n Les didn\\'t hear her. He strode to the detective set, followed at a safe\\n distance by the eyeball, and picked up the box.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, watch out!\" Bob cried. A small flashlight fell from the box,\\n landed on its side and its bulb flashed on, throwing a pencil of light\\n across Les\\'s hands.\\nBob retrieved the flashlight and turned it off while Les glanced\\n through an instruction booklet, frowning.\\n\\n\\n \"This toy is too complicated for a ten-year-old boy,\" Les told his\\n wife. \"I don\\'t know why you ordered such a thing.\" He tossed the\\n booklet into the empty box.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to return it, if you don\\'t smudge it up,\" she replied. \"Look\\n at the marks you made on the instructions.\" The black finger-marks\\n stood out clearly against the shiny, coated paper.\\n\\n\\n Les looked at his hands. \"I didn\\'t do it,\" he said, pressing his clean\\n fingertips against the kitchen table.\\n\\n\\n Black fingerprints, a full set of them, stood out against the sparkling\\n polished table\\'s surface.\\n\\n\\n \"I think the Detectolite did it,\" Bob said. \"The instructions say\\n you\\'ve got to be very careful with it, because its effects last for a\\n long time.\"\\n\\n\\n Les began scrubbing his hands vigorously at the sink. Ann watched him\\n silently, until she saw his fingerprints appear on the faucet, the soap\\n and the towel. She began to yell at him for making such a mess, when\\n Sally floated into the kitchen. The girl was wearing a nightgown.\\n\\n\\n \"My God!\" Ann forgot her tongue before the children. \"She got out of\\n that dress herself. Where did she get that nightgown?\"\\n\\n\\n Ann fingered the garment. She didn\\'t recognize it as a nightgown. But\\n in cut and fold, it was suspiciously like the dress that had arrived in\\n the parcel. Her heart sank.\\n\\n\\n She picked up the child, felt the hot forehead, and said: \"Les, I think\\n it\\'s the same dress. It must change color or something when it\\'s time\\n for a nap. It seems impossible, but—\" She shrugged mutely. \"And I\\n think Sally\\'s running a temperature. I\\'m going to put her to bed.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked worriedly into the reddened eyes of the small girl, who\\n whimpered on the way to the bedroom. Ann carried her up the stairs,\\n keeping her balance with difficulty, as Sally threatened to pop upward\\n out of her arms.\\n\\n\\n The whole family decided that bed might be a good idea, soon after\\n dinner. When the lights went out, the house seemed to be nearly normal.\\n Les put on a pair of gloves and threw a pillowcase over the eyeball.\\n Bob rigged up trestles to warn visitors from the front porch. Ann\\n put small wads of cotton into her ears, because she didn\\'t like the\\n rhythmic rattle, soft but persistent, that emerged from the hall\\n closet where the manky sat. Sally was whining occasionally in her sleep.\\nWhen daylight entered her room, Sally\\'s nightgown had turned back into\\n the new dress. But the little girl was too sick to get out of bed.\\n She wasn\\'t hungry, her nose was running, and she had a dry cough. Les\\n called the doctor before going to work.\\n\\n\\n The only good thing about the morning for Ann was the fact that the\\n manky had quieted down some time in the night. After she got Bob to\\n school, she gingerly opened the closet door. The manky was now glowing\\n a bright pink and seemed slightly larger. Deep violet lettering stood\\n out on its side:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nToday is Wednesday. For obvious reasons, the manky will not operate\\n today.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n The mailman brought a letter from Hartshorne-Logan. Ann stared stupidly\\n at the envelope, until she realized that this wasn\\'t an impossibly\\n quick answer to the letter she had written yesterday. It must have\\n crossed in the mail her complaint about the non-arrival of the order.\\n She tore open the envelope and read:\\n\\n\\n \"We regret to inform you that your order cannot be filled until the\\n balance you owe us has been reduced. From the attached form, you will\\n readily ascertain that the payment of $87.56 will enable you to resume\\n the purchasing of merchandise on credit. We shall fill your recent\\n order as soon....\"\\n\\n\\n Ann crumpled the letter and threw it into the imitation fireplace,\\n knowing perfectly well that it would need to be retrieved for Les after\\n work tonight. She had just decided to call Hartshorne-Logan\\'s complaint\\n department when the phone rang.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid I must ask you to come down to the school, Mrs. Morris,\" a\\n voice said. \"Your son is in trouble. He claims that it\\'s connected with\\n something that his parents gave him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My son?\" Ann asked incredulously. \"Bob?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. It\\'s a little gadget that looks like a water pistol. Your son\\n insists that he didn\\'t know it would make clothing transparent. He\\n claims it was just accident that he tried it out when he was walking\\n by the gym during calisthenics. We\\'ve had to call upon every family\\n in the neighborhood for blankets. Bob has always been a good boy and\\n we believe that we can expel him quietly without newspaper publicity\\n involving his name, if you\\'ll—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be right down,\" Ann said. \"I mean I won\\'t be right down. I\\'ve got\\n a sick baby here. Don\\'t do anything till I telephone my husband. And\\n I\\'m sorry for Bob. I mean I\\'m sorry for the girls, and for the boys,\\n too. I\\'m sorry for—for everything. Good-by.\"\\nJust as she hung up the telephone, the doorbell rang. It rang with a\\n normal buzz, then began to play soft music. Ann opened the door without\\n difficulty, to admit Dr. Schwartz.\\n\\n\\n \"You aren\\'t going to believe me, Doctor,\" Ann said while he took the\\n child\\'s temperature, \"but we can\\'t get that dress off Sally.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kids are stubborn sometimes.\" Dr. Schwartz whistled softly when he\\n looked at the thermometer. \"She\\'s pretty sick. I want a blood count\\n before I try to move her. Let me undress her.\"\\n\\n\\n Sally had been mumbling half-deliriously. She made no effort to resist\\n as the doctor picked her up. But when he raised a fold of the dress and\\n began to pull it back, she screamed.\\n\\n\\n The doctor dropped the dress and looked in perplexity at the point\\n where it touched Sally\\'s skin.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s apparently an allergy to some new kind of material. But I don\\'t\\n understand why the dress won\\'t come off. It\\'s not stuck tight.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bother trying,\" Ann said miserably. \"Just cut it off.\"\\n\\n\\n Dr. Schwartz pulled scissors from his bag and clipped at a sleeve. When\\n he had cut it to the shoulder, he gently began to peel back the edges\\n of the cloth. Sally writhed and kicked, then collapsed in a faint. The\\n physician smoothed the folds hastily back into place.\\n\\n\\n He looked helpless as he said to Ann: \"I don\\'t know quite what to do.\\n The flesh starts to hemorrhage when I pull at the cloth. She\\'d bleed to\\n death if I yanked it off. But it\\'s such an extreme allergy that it may\\n kill her, if we leave it in contact with the skin.\"\\n\\n\\n The manky\\'s rattle suddenly began rhythmically from the lower part of\\n the house. Ann clutched the side of the chair, trying to keep herself\\n under control. A siren wailed somewhere down the street, grew louder\\n rapidly, suddenly going silent at the peak of its crescendo.\\n\\n\\n Dr. Schwartz glanced outside the window. \"An ambulance. Looks as if\\n they\\'re stopping here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" Ann breathed. \"Something\\'s happened to Les.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It sure will,\" Les said grimly, walking into the bedroom. \"I won\\'t\\n have a job if I can\\'t get this stuff off my fingers. Big black\\n fingerprints on everything I touch. I can\\'t handle correspondence or\\n shake hands with customers. How\\'s the kid? What\\'s the ambulance doing\\n out front?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re going to the next house down the street,\" the physician said.\\n \"Has there been sickness there?\"\\n\\n\\n Les held up his hands, palms toward the doctor. \"What\\'s wrong with me?\\n My fingers look all right. But they leave black marks on everything I\\n touch.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor looked closely at the fingertips. \"Every human has natural\\n oil on the skin. That\\'s how detectives get results with their\\n fingerprint powder. But I\\'ve never heard of nigrification, in this\\n sense. Better not try to commit any crimes until you\\'ve seen a skin\\n specialist.\"\\nAnn was peering through the window, curious about the ambulance despite\\n her own troubles. She saw two attendants carry Mr. Burnett, motionless\\n and white, on a stretcher from the house next door into the ambulance.\\n A third member of the crew was struggling with a disheveled Mrs.\\n Burnett at the door. Shrieks that sounded like \"Murder!\" came sharply\\n through the window.\\n\\n\\n \"I know those bearers,\" Dr. Schwartz said. He yanked the window open.\\n \"Hey, Pete! What\\'s wrong?\"\\n\\n\\n The front man with the stretcher looked up. \"I don\\'t know. This guy\\'s\\n awful sick. I think his wife is nuts.\"\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Burnett had broken free. She dashed halfway down the sidewalk,\\n gesticulating wildly to nobody in particular.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s murder!\" she screamed. \"Murder again! He\\'s been poisoned! He\\'s\\n going to die! It means the electric chair!\"\\n\\n\\n The orderly grabbed her again. This time he stuffed a handkerchief into\\n her mouth to quiet her.\\n\\n\\n \"Come back to this house as soon as you deliver him,\" Dr. Schwartz\\n shouted to the men. \"We\\'ve got a very sick child up here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was afraid this would happen,\" Les said. \"The poor woman already has\\n lost three husbands. If this one is sick, it\\'s no wonder she thinks\\n that somebody is poisoning him.\"\\n\\n\\n Bob stuck his head around the bedroom door. His mother stared\\n unbelievingly for a moment, then advanced on him threateningly.\\n Something in his face restrained her, just as she was about to start\\n shaking him.\\n\\n\\n \"I got something important to tell you,\" Bob said rapidly, ready to\\n duck. \"I snuck out of the principal\\'s office and came home. I got to\\n tell you what I did.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I heard all about what you did,\" Ann said, advancing again. \"And\\n you\\'re not going to slip away from me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Give me a chance to explain something. Downstairs. So he won\\'t hear,\"\\n Bob ended in a whisper, nodding toward the doctor.\\nAnn looked doubtfully at Les, then followed Bob down the stairs. The\\n doorbell was monotonously saying in a monotone: \"Don\\'t answer me,\\n don\\'t answer me, don\\'t go to the door.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did you do it?\" Ann asked Bob, her anger suddenly slumping into\\n weary sadness. \"People will suspect you of being a sex maniac for the\\n rest of your life. You can\\'t possibly explain—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bother about the girls\\' clothing,\" Bob said, \"because it was\\n only an accident. The really important thing is something else I did\\n before I left the house.\"\\n\\n\\n Les, cursing softly, hurried past them on the way to answer the\\n knocking. He ignored the doorbell\\'s pleas.\\n\\n\\n \"I forgot about it,\" Bob continued, \"when that ray gun accidentally\\n went off. Then when they put me in the principal\\'s office, I had time\\n to think, and I remembered. I put some white stuff from the detective\\n kit into that sugar we lent Mrs. Burnett last night. I just wanted to\\n see what would happen. I don\\'t know exactly what effect—\"\\n\\n\\n \"He put stuff in the sugar?\" A deep, booming voice came from the front\\n of the house. Mother and son looked through the hall. A policeman stood\\n on the threshold of the front door. \"I heard that! The woman next door\\n claims that her husband is poisoned. Young man, I\\'m going to put you\\n under arrest.\"\\n\\n\\n The policeman stepped over the threshold. A blue flash darted from\\n the doorbell box, striking him squarely on the chest. The policeman\\n staggered back, sitting down abruptly on the porch. A scent of ozone\\n drifted through the house.\\n\\n\\n \"Close the door, close the door,\" the doorbell was chanting urgently.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s that ambulance?\" Dr. Schwartz yelled from the top of the\\n steps. \"The child\\'s getting worse.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Then why was a non-suicidal\\n\\n man driven to suicide there? Yet it made sense.\\nWhy do people commit suicide?\\nTemplin tightened his safety belt and lay back on the acceleration\\n bunk. The lights in the cabin dimmed to a dull, red glow that meant the\\n time for takeoff was nearing. He could hear noises from deep within\\n the ship and the tiny whir of the ventilator fan, filling the air with\\n the sweetish smell of sleeping gas. To sleep the trip away was better\\n than to face the dull monotony of the stars for days on end.\\nOh, they kill themselves for lots of reasons. Maybe ill health or\\n financial messes or family difficulties. An unhappy love affair. Or\\n more complex ones, if you went into it deeper. The failure to achieve\\n an ambition, failure to live up to one\\'s own ideals. Weltschmerz,\\n perhaps.\\nHe could smell the bitter fragrance of tobacco smoke mingling with\\n the gas. Eckert had lit a cigarette and was calmly blowing the smoke\\n at the neon \"No Smoking\" sign, which winked on and off in mechanical\\n disapproval.\\n\\n\\n He turned his head slightly so he could just see Eckert in the bank\\n facing him. Eckert, one of the good gray men in the Service. The old\\n reliables, the ones who could take almost anything in their stride\\n because, at one time or another, they had had to.\\nIt was Eckert who had come into his office several days ago and told\\n him that Don Pendleton had killed himself.\\nOnly Pendleton wasn\\'t the type. He was the kind who have everything\\n to live for, the kind you instinctively know will amount to something\\n someday. And that was a lousy way to remember him. The clichés always\\n come first. Your memory plays traitor and boils friendship down to the\\n status of a breakfast food testimonial.\\nThe soft red lights seemed to be dancing in the darkness of the cabin.\\n Eckert was just a dull, formless blur opposite him. His cigarette was\\n out.\\n\\n\\n Eckert had come into his office without saying a word and had watched\\n his scenery-window. It had been snowing in the window, the white flakes\\n making a simple pattern drifting past the glass. Eckert had fiddled\\n with the controls and changed it to sunshine, then to a weird mixture\\n of hail amid the brassy, golden sunlight.\\n\\n\\n And then Eckert had told him that Pendleton had taken the short way out.\\nHe shouldn\\'t get sentimental. But how the hell else should he remember\\n Pendleton? Try to forget it and drink a toast to him at the next class\\n reunion? And never, never be so crude as to speculate why Pendleton\\n should have done it? If, of course, he had....\\nThe cabin was hazy in the reddish glow, the sleeping gas a heavy\\n perfume.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and he had talked it out and gone over the records. Pendleton\\n had come of good stock. There had been no mental instability in his\\n family for as far back as the genetic records went. He had been raised\\n in a middle-class neighborhood and attended a local grammar school\\n where he had achieved average grades and had given his instructors the\\n normal amount of trouble. Later, when he had made up his mind to enter\\n the Diplomatic Service, his grades had improved. He had worked hard at\\n it, though he wasn\\'t what you would call a grind. In high school and\\n later in college, he was the well-balanced type, athletic, popular,\\n hard-working.\\nHow long would it be before memories faded and all there was left\\n of Pendleton was a page of statistics? He had been on this team, he\\n had been elected president of that, he had graduated with such and\\n such honors. But try getting a picture of him by reading the records,\\n resurrect him from a page of black print. Would he be human? Would\\n he be flesh and blood? Hell, no! In the statistics Pendleton was the\\n All-Around Boy, the cold marble statue with the finely chiseled muscles\\n and the smooth, blank sockets where the eyes should be. Maybe someday\\n fate would play a trick on a hero-worshiping public and there would\\n actually be kids like that. But they wouldn\\'t be human; they wouldn\\'t\\n be born. Parents would get them by sending in so many box tops.\\nHe was drowsy; the room was filled with the gas now. It would be only a\\n matter of minutes before he would be asleep.\\n\\n\\n Pendleton had been in his second year as attache on Tunpesh, a small\\n planet with a G-type sun. The Service had stumbled across it recently\\n and decided the system was worth diplomatic recognition of some kind,\\n so Pendleton had been sent there. He had been the first attache to be\\n sent and naturally he had gone alone.\\n\\n\\n There was no need to send more. Tunpesh had been inspected and\\n certified and approved. The natives were primitive and friendly. Or\\n maybe the Service had slipped up, as it sometimes did, and Tunpesh had\\n received something less than a thorough survey.\\n\\n\\n And then an unscheduled freighter had put in for repairs, one of\\n the very few ships that ever came by Tunpesh. The captain had tried\\n to pay his respects to Pendleton. Only Pendleton wasn\\'t there. The\\n natives said he had killed himself and showed the captain the little\\n flower-covered plot where they had buried him.\\n\\n\\n Tunpesh had been Pendleton\\'s second assignment.\\nThe natives were oh-so-friendly. So friendly that he had made sure\\n that a certain box was on board, filled with shiny atomic rifles,\\n needle pistols, and the fat little gas guns. They might be needed.\\n People like Pendleton didn\\'t kill themselves, did they? No, they\\n didn\\'t. But sometimes they were murdered.\\nIt was almost black inside the cabin now; only a thin red line around\\n the ceiling told how close they were to takeoff. His head was thick\\n with drowsiness, his eyelids a heavy weight that he knew he couldn\\'t\\n keep open much longer.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and he had been chosen to go to Tunpesh and investigate. The two\\n of them, working together, should be able to find out why Pendleton had\\n killed himself.\\nBut that wasn\\'t the real reason. Maybe Eckert thought so, but he knew\\n better. The real reason they were going there was to find out why\\n Pendleton had been killed and who had killed him. That was it.\\nWho had killed Cock Robin?\\nThe thin red line was practically microscopic now and Templin could\\n feel his lashes lying gently on his cheeks. But he wasn\\'t asleep—not\\n quite. There was something buzzing about in the dim recesses of his\\n mind.\\n\\n\\n Their information on Tunpesh was limited. They knew that it had no\\n trading concessions or armed forces and that nobody from neighboring\\n systems seemed to know much about it or even visited it. But a staff\\n anthropologist must have been routinely assigned to Tunpesh to furnish\\n data and reports.\\n\\n\\n \"Ted?\" he murmured sleepily.\\n\\n\\n A faint stirring in the black bulk opposite him. \"Yes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How come our anthropologist on Tunpesh didn\\'t come across with more\\n information?\"\\n\\n\\n A drowsy mumble from the other cot: \"He wasn\\'t there long enough. He\\n committed suicide not long after landing.\"\\n\\n\\n The room was a whirling pool of blackness into which his mind was\\n slowly slipping. Takeoff was only seconds away.\\nWhy do people commit suicide?\\n\"It\\'s a nice day, isn\\'t it, Ted?\" Eckert took a deep and pleasurable\\n breath. \"It\\'s the type of day that makes you feel good just to be\\n alive.\"\\n\\n\\n Warm breezes rustled through Eckert\\'s graying hair and tugged gently\\n at his tunic. The air smelled as if it had been washed and faintly\\n perfumed with the balsamy scent of something very much like pine. A\\n few hundred yards away, a forest towered straight and slim and coolly\\n inviting, and brilliantly colored birds whirled and fluttered in the\\n foliage.\\n\\n\\n The rocketport, where they were standing surrounded by their luggage,\\n was a grassy valley where the all too infrequent ships could land and\\n discharge cargo or make repairs. There was a blackened patch on it now,\\n with little blast-ignited flames dying out around the edges.\\nIt won\\'t\\n be long before it will be green again\\n, he thought. The grass looked\\n as though it grew fast—it would certainly have plenty of time to grow\\n before the next ship landed.\\n\\n\\n He looked at the slim, dwindling shape that was the rocket, and was\\n suddenly, acutely aware that he and Templin would be stranded for six\\n months on a foreign and very possibly dangerous planet. And there would\\n be no way of calling for help or of leaving before the six months were\\n up.\\n\\n\\n He stood there for a moment, drinking in the fresh air and feeling the\\n warmth of the sun against his face. It might be a pleasant six months\\n at that, away from the din and the hustle and confusion, spending the\\n time in a place where the sun was warm and inviting.\\nI must be getting old\\n, he thought,\\nthinking about the warmth and\\n comfort. Like old dogs and octogenarians.\\nTemplin was looking at the scenery with a disappointed expression on\\n his face. Eckert stole a side glance at him and for a fleeting moment\\n felt vaguely concerned. \"Don\\'t be disappointed if it doesn\\'t look like\\n cloak-and-dagger right off, Ray. What seems innocent enough on the\\n surface can prove to be quite dangerous underneath.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s rather hard to think of danger in a setting like this.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert nodded agreement. \"It wouldn\\'t fit, would it? It would be like a\\n famous singer suddenly doing a jazz number in an opera, or having the\\n princess in a fairy tale turn out to be ugly.\" He gestured toward the\\n village. \"You could hardly class that as dangerous from its outward\\n appearance, could you?\"\\n\\n\\n The rocketport was in a small valley, surrounded by low, wooded hills.\\n The village started where the port left off and crawled and wound over\\n the wooded ridges. Small houses of sun-baked, white-washed mud crouched\\n in the shadow of huge trees and hugged the banks of a small stream.\\n\\n\\n It looked fairly primitive, Eckert thought, and yet it didn\\'t have the\\n earmarks, the characteristics of most primitive villages. It didn\\'t\\n seem cluttered or dirty and you didn\\'t feel like beating a hasty\\n retreat when the wind was blowing toward you.\\n\\n\\n A few adults were watching them curiously and the usual bunch of\\n kids that always congregated around rocketports quickly gathered.\\n Eckert stared at them for a moment, wondering what it was that seemed\\n odd about them, and they stared back with all the alert dignity of\\n childhood. They finally came out on the field and clustered around him\\n and Templin.\\n\\n\\n Templin studied them warily. \"Better watch them, Ted. Even kids can be\\n dangerous.\"\\nIt\\'s because you never suspect kids\\n, Eckert thought,\\nyou never think\\n they\\'ll do any harm. But they can be taught. They could do as much\\n damage with a knife as a man could, for instance. And they might have\\n other weapons.\\nBut the idea still didn\\'t go with the warm sun and the blue sky and the\\n piny scent of the trees.\\n\\n\\n One of the adults of the village started to walk toward them.\\n\\n\\n \"The reception committee,\" Templin said tightly. His hand went inside\\n his tunic.\\n\\n\\n He couldn\\'t be blamed for being jumpy, Eckert realized. This was his\\n first time out, his first mission like this. And, of course, Pendleton\\n had been a pretty good friend of his.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d be very careful what I did,\" Eckert said softly. \"I would hate to\\n start something merely because I misunderstood their intentions.\"\\n\\n\\n The committee of one was a middle-aged man dressed in a simple strip of\\n white cloth twisted about his waist and allowed to hang freely to his\\n knees. When he got closer, Eckert became less sure of his age. He had\\n the firm, tanned musculature of a much younger man, though a slightly\\n seamed face and white hair aged him somewhat. Eckert still had the\\n feeling that if you wanted to know his exact age, you\\'d have to look\\n at his teeth or know something about his epiphyseal closures.\\n\\n\\n \"You are\\nmenshars\\nfrom Earth?\" The voice was husky and pleasant and\\n the pronunciation was very clear. Eckert regarded him thoughtfully\\n and made a few mental notes. He wasn\\'t bowing and scraping like most\\n natives who weren\\'t too familiar with visitors from the sky, and yet he\\n was hardly either friendly or hostile.\\n\\n\\n \"You learned our language from Pendleton and Reynolds?\" Reynolds had\\n been the anthropologist.\\n\\n\\n \"We have had visitors from Earth before.\" He hesitated a moment\\n and then offered his hand, somewhat shyly, Eckert thought, in the\\n Terrestrial sign of greeting. \"You may call me\\nJathong\\nif you wish.\"\\n He paused a moment to say something in his native tongue to the kids\\n who were around. They promptly scattered and picked up the luggage.\\n \"While you are here, you will need a place to stay. There is one ready,\\n if you will follow me.\"\\n\\n\\n He was polite, Eckert thought. He didn\\'t ask what they were there\\n for or how long they were going to stay. But then again, perhaps the\\n natives were a better judge of that than he and Templin.\\n\\n\\n The town was larger than he had thought at first, stretching over a\\n wide expanse of the countryside. There wasn\\'t, so far as he could see,\\n much manufacturing above the level of handicrafts and simple weaving.\\n Colored patches on far hillsides indicated the presence of farms, and\\n practically every house in the village had its small garden.\\n\\n\\n What manufacturing there was seemed to be carried on in the central\\n square of the town, where a few adults and children squatted in the\\n warm afternoon sun and worked industriously at potter\\'s wheels and\\n weaver\\'s looms. The other part of the square was given over to the\\n native bazaar where pots and bolts of cloth were for sale, and where\\n numerous stalls were loaded with dried fruits and vegetables and the\\n cleaned and plucked carcasses of the local variety of fowl.\\n\\n\\n It was late afternoon when they followed Jathong into a small,\\n white-washed house midway up a hill.\\n\\n\\n \"You are free to use this while you are here,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and Templin took a quick tour of the few rooms. They were well\\n furnished, in a rustic sort of way, and what modern conveniences they\\n didn\\'t have they could easily do without. The youngsters who had\\n carried their luggage left it outside and quietly faded away. It was\\n getting dark; Eckert opened one of the boxes they had brought along,\\n took out an electric lantern and lighted it. He turned to Jathong.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been very kind to us and we would like to repay you. You may\\n take what you wish of anything within this box.\" He opened another of\\n the boxes and displayed the usual trade goods—brightly colored cloth\\n and finely worked jewelry and a few mechanical contrivances that Eckert\\n knew usually appealed to the primitive imagination.\\n\\n\\n Jathong ran his hand over the cloth and held some of the jewelry up to\\n the light. Eckert knew by the way he looked at it that he wasn\\'t at all\\n impressed. \"I am grateful,\" he said finally, \"but there is nothing I\\n want.\" He turned and walked away into the gathering darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"The incorruptible native.\" Templin laughed sarcastically.\\n\\n\\n Eckert shrugged. \"That\\'s one of the things you do out of habit, try\\n and buy some of the natives so you\\'ll have friends in case you need\\n them.\" He stopped for a moment, thinking. \"Did you notice the context?\\n He didn\\'t say he didn\\'t want what we showed him. He said there was\\nnothing\\nthat he wanted. Implying that everything he wanted, he\\n already had.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not very typical of a primitive society, is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I\\'m afraid it\\'s not.\" Eckert started unpacking some of the boxes.\\n \"You know, Ray, I got a kick out of the kids. They\\'re a healthy-looking\\n lot, aren\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too healthy,\" Templin said. \"There didn\\'t seem to be any sick ones or\\n ones with runny noses or cuts or black eyes or bruises. It doesn\\'t seem\\n natural.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re probably just well brought-up kids,\" Eckert said sharply.\\n \"Maybe they\\'ve been taught not to get in fights or play around in the\\n mud on the way home from school.\" He felt faintly irritated, annoyed at\\n the way Templin had put it, as if any deviation from an Earth norm was\\n potentially dangerous.\\n\\n\\n \"Ted.\" Templin\\'s voice was strained. \"This could be a trap, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n\\n The words came out slowly. \"The people are too casual, as though\\n they\\'re playing a rehearsed part. Here we are, from an entirely\\n different solar system, landed in what must be to them an unusual\\n manner. They couldn\\'t have seen rockets more than three or four\\n times before. It should still be a novelty to them. And yet how much\\n curiosity did they show? Hardly any. Was there any fear? No. And the\\n cute, harmless little kids.\" He looked at Eckert. \"Maybe that\\'s what\\n we\\'re supposed to think—just an idyllic, harmless society. Maybe\\n that\\'s what Pendleton thought, right to the very end.\"\\n\\n\\n He was keyed up, jumpy, Eckert realized. He would probably be seeing\\n things in every shadow and imagining danger to be lurking around every\\n corner.\\n\\n\\n \"It hasn\\'t been established yet that Pendleton was killed, Ray. Let\\'s\\n keep an open mind until we know for certain.\"\\n\\n\\n He flicked out the light and lay back on the cool bed, letting his\\n body relax completely. The cool night wind blew lazily through the\\n wood slat blinds, carrying the fragrance of the trees and the grass,\\n and he inhaled deeply and let his thoughts wander for a moment. It was\\n going to be pleasant to live on Tunpesh for six months—even if the six\\n months were all they had to live. The climate was superb and the people\\n seemed a cut above the usual primitive culture. If he ever retired some\\n day, he thought suddenly, he would have to remember Tunpesh. It would\\n be pleasant to spend his old age here. And the fishing was probably\\n excellent....\\n\\n\\n He turned his head a little to watch Templin get ready for bed. There\\n were advantages in taking him along that Templin probably didn\\'t\\n even realize. He wondered what Templin would do if he ever found out\\n that the actual reason he had been chosen to go was that his own\\n psychological chart was very close to Pendleton\\'s. Pendleton\\'s own\\n feelings and emotions would almost exactly be duplicated in Templin\\'s.\\n\\n\\n A few stray wisps of starlight pierced through the blinds and sparkled\\n for an instant on a small metal box strapped to Templin\\'s waist. A\\n power pack, Eckert saw grimly, probably leading to the buttons on his\\n tunic. A very convenient, portable, and hard to detect weapon.\\n\\n\\n There were disadvantages in taking Templin, too.\\n\"Just how primitive do you think the society is, Ted?\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert put down the chain he had been whittling and reached for his\\n pipe and tobacco.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think it\\'s primitive at all. There are too many disparities.\\n Their knowledge of a lot of things is a little more than empirical\\n knowledge; they associate the growth of crops with fertilizer and\\n nitrogen in the soil as well as sunlight, rather than the blessings of\\n some native god. And they differ a lot in other respects. Their art and\\n their music are advanced. Free art exists along with purely decorative\\n art, and their techniques are finely developed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m glad you agree, then. Take a look at this.\" Templin threw a shiny\\n bit of metal on the rough-hewn table. Eckert picked it up and inspected\\n it. It was heavy and one side of it was extremely sharp.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s it for?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve got a hospital set up here. Not a hospital like any we know,\\n of course, but a hospital nonetheless. It\\'s not used very much;\\n apparently the natives don\\'t get sick here. But occasionally there are\\n hunting accidents and injuries that require surgery. The strip of metal\\n there is a scalpel.\" He laughed shortly. \"Primitive little gadget, but\\n it works well—as well as any of ours.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert hefted it in his palm. \"The most important thing is that they\\n have the knowledge to use it. Surgery isn\\'t a simple science.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what do you think about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The obvious. They evidently have as much technology as they want, at\\n least in fields where they have to have it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How come they haven\\'t gone any further?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why should they? You can live without skycars and rocket ships, you\\n know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did you ever wonder what kind of weapons they might have?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The important thing,\" Eckert mused, \"is not if they have them, but if\\n they\\'d use them. And I rather doubt that they would. We\\'ve been here\\n for two weeks now and they\\'ve been very kind to us, seeing that we\\'ve\\n had food and water and what fuel we need.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s known in the livestock trade as being fattened up for the\\n slaughter,\" Templeton said.\\n\\n\\n Eckert sighed and watched a fat bug waddle across a small patch of\\n sunlight on the wooden floor. It was bad enough drawing an assignment\\n in a totally foreign culture, even if the natives were humanoid. It\\n complicated things beyond all measure when your partner in the project\\n seemed likely to turn into a vendettist. It meant that Eckert would\\n have to split his energies. He\\'d have to do what investigating he could\\n among the Tunpeshans, and he\\'d have to watch Templin to see that he\\n didn\\'t go off half-cocked and spoil everything.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin nodded. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Tunpeshans know why we\\'re here. We\\'ve dropped enough hints along\\n those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; nobody has volunteered\\n any information about him. And he was an attache here for three\\n years. Didn\\'t anybody know him during that time? We\\'ve let slip a few\\n discreet statements that we would like to talk to Pendleton\\'s friends,\\n yet nobody\\'s come around. Apparently, in all the three years he was\\n here, Pendleton didn\\'t make any friends. And that\\'s a little hard to\\n believe. It\\'s more likely that his friends have been silenced and any\\n information about him is being withheld for a reason.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What reason?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin shrugged. \"Murder. What other reason could there be?\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the\\n scenery. A hundred feet down the road, a native woman was going to\\n market, leading a species of food animal by the halter.\\n\\n\\n \"They grow their women nice, don\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Physically perfect, like the men,\" Templin grumbled. \"You could get an\\n inferiority complex just from watching the people here. Everybody\\'s so\\n damn perfect. Nobody\\'s sick, nobody\\'s unhealthy, nobody is too fat or\\n too thin, nobody\\'s unhappy. The only variation is that they don\\'t all\\n look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Does it? I hadn\\'t noticed.\" Eckert turned away from the blinds. His\\n voice was crisp. \"I knew Don Pendleton quite well, too,\" he said. \"But\\n it isn\\'t blinding me to what I\\'m here for. We came to find out what\\n happened to him, not to substantiate any preconceived notions. What\\n we find out may be vitally important to anybody serving here in the\\n future. I would hate to see our efforts spoiled because you\\'ve already\\n made up your mind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You knew Pendleton,\" Templin repeated grimly. \"Do you think it was\\n suicide?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think there\\'s such a thing as a suicide type, when you come\\n down to it. I\\'m not ruling out the possibility of murder, either. I\\'m\\n trying to keep an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What have we accomplished so far? What have we found out?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got six months,\" Eckert said quietly. \"Six months in which\\n we\\'ll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and try to\\n cultivate informants. We would get nowhere if we came barging in asking\\n all sorts of questions. And don\\'t forget, Ray, we\\'re all alone on\\n Tunpesh. If it is a case of murder, what happens when the natives find\\n out that we know it is?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin\\'s eyes dueled for a moment. Then he turned his back and walked\\n to the window. \"I suppose you\\'re right,\" he said at last. \"It\\'s nice\\n living here, Ted. Maybe I\\'ve been fighting it. But I can\\'t help\\n thinking that Don must have liked it here, too.\"\\nOne of the hardest things to learn in a foreign culture, Eckert\\n thought, is when to enjoy yourself, when to work and when to worry.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nPelache, menshar?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSharra!\\n\" He took the small bowl of\\npelache\\nnuts, helped himself\\n to a few, and passed the bowl on. This was definitely the time to\\n enjoy himself, not to work or worry. He had heard about the\\nhalera\\na\\n few days ago, and, by judicious hinting to the proper authorities, he\\n and Templin had been invited. It was a good chance to observe native\\n customs. A little anthropology—with refreshments.\\n\\n\\n The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous\\n helpings of the roasted\\nulami\\nand the broiled\\nhalunch\\nand numerous\\n dabs from the side dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course,\\n they passed around a small flagon of the hot, spiced native wine, but\\n he noticed that nobody drank to excess.\\nThe old Greek ideal\\n, he thought:\\nmoderation in everything.\\nHe looked at Templin, sitting across from him in the huge circle, and\\n shrugged mentally. Templin looked as if he was about to break down and\\n enjoy himself, but there was still a slight bulge under his tunic,\\n where he had strapped his power pack. Any fool should have known that\\n nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The only actual danger lay\\n in Templin\\'s getting excited and doing something he was bound to regret\\n later on. And even that danger was not quite as likely now.\\nThere will be hell to pay\\n, Eckert thought,\\nif Templin ever finds out\\n that I sabotaged his power pack.\\n\"You look thoughtful,\\nmenshar\\nEckert.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert took another sip of the wine and turned to the Tunpeshan on his\\n left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm chin and a\\n certain aura of authority.\\n\\n\\n \"I was wondering if my countryman Pendleton had offended your people in\\n any way, Nayova.\" Now was as good a time as any to pump him for what he\\n knew about Pendleton\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n \"So far as I know,\\nmenshar\\nPendleton offended no one. I do not know\\n what duties he had to perform here, but he was a generous and courteous\\n man.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert gnawed the dainty meat off a slender\\nulami\\nbone and tried to\\n appear casual in his questioning.\\n\\n\\n \"I am sure he was, Nayova. I am sure, too, that you were as kind to him\\n as you have been to Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to\\n you for that.\"\\n\\n\\n Nayova seemed pleased. \"We tried to do as well for\\nmenshar\\nPendleton\\n as we could. While he was here, he had the house that you have now and\\n we saw that he was supplied with food and all other necessities.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert had a sudden clammy feeling which quickly passed away. What\\n Nayova had said was something he\\'d make sure Templin never heard about.\\n He wiped his mouth on a broad, flat leaf that had been provided and\\n took another sip of the wine.\\n\\n\\n \"We were shocked to find out that\\nmenshar\\nPendleton had killed\\n himself. We knew him quite well and we could not bring ourselves to\\n believe he had done such a thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Nayova\\'s gaze slid away from him. \"Perhaps it was the will of the Great\\n One,\" he said vaguely. He didn\\'t seem anxious to talk about it.\\n\\n\\n Eckert stared bleakly at his wine glass and tried to put the pieces of\\n information together. They probably had a taboo about self-destruction\\n which would make it difficult to talk about. That would make it even\\n harder for him to find out by direct questioning.\\n\\n\\n A native fife trilled shrilly and a group of young men and women walked\\n into the room. The circle broke to let them through and they came and\\n knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands sharply, they retreated\\n to the center of the circle and began the slow motions of a native\\n dance.\\nThe sound of the fife softened and died and the slow monotonous beat of\\n drums took its place. The beat slowly increased and so did the rhythm\\n of the dancers. The small fires at the corners of the hut were allowed\\n to dwindle and the center of the circle became filled with the motions\\n of shadows intermixed with the swift, sure movements of glistening\\n limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently the dance was\\n the Tunpeshan version of the\\nrites de passage\\n. He glanced across\\n the circle at Templin. Templin\\'s face—what he could see of it by the\\n flickering light—was brick red.\\n\\n\\n A voice spoke in his ear. \"It is hard for us to imagine anybody doing\\n what\\nmenshar\\nPendleton did. It is ...\" and he used a native word that\\n Eckert translated as being roughly equivalent to \"\\nobscene\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n The dancers at the center of the circle finally bowed out with small\\n garlands of flowers on their heads that signified their reaching\\n adulthood. Acrobats then took the stage and went through a dizzying\\n routine, and they in turn were succeeded by a native singer.\\n\\n\\n They were all excellent, Eckert thought. If anything, they were too\\n good.\\n\\n\\n The bowl of\\npelache\\nnuts made its way around again and Nayova leaned\\n over to speak to him. \"If there is any possibility that I can help you\\n while you are here,\\nmenshar\\nEckert, you have but to ask.\"\\n\\n\\n It would probably be a mistake to ask for a list of Pendleton\\'s\\n friends, but there was a way around that. \"I would like to meet any\\n of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or\\n socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them in any way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think they would be glad to help you. I shall ask them to go to you\\n this coming week.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

There isn’t\\n anything that Judy can’t solve.”\\nLorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters\\n now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\\n loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s\\n part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\\n wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe\\n she’d understand—understand any better than I do.\\n Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no\\n exception.”\\n“You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming\\n in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\\n for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have\\n problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t\\n solve.”\\n“Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one\\n single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll\\n believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”\\n“Judy Dobbs, remember?”\\n“Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\\n all those mysteries. I met you when the whole\\n valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\\n by flood and you solved that—”\\n“That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace,\\n not me. He was the hero without even meaning to\\n be. He was the one who rode through town and\\n warned people that the flood was coming. I was off\\n chasing a shadow.”\\n“A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.\\n “What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”\\n“It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.\\n “I know now that keeping that promise not\\n to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\\n could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”\\n“Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\\n her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”\\n“Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk\\n about?”\\n“You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve\\n solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\\n two before the flood, but what about the haunted\\n house you moved into? You were the one who\\n tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\\n and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing\\n ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\\n you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”\\n“Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,\\n “there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There\\n was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\\n what she was or how she spoke to me is more than\\n I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling.\\n And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them.\\n They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\\n this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of\\n them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re\\n stored in one end of the attic.”\\n“Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed\\n Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and\\n show up the spooks?”\\n“I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”\\nJudy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\\n wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\\n but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\\n told them, the summer before they met. Horace\\n had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\\n that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton\\n Lee, who gave him his job with the\\nFarringdon\\n Daily Herald\\n. He had turned in some interesting\\n church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\\n the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\\n he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\\n where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\\n mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\\n loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\\nHer thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\\n confessed now as she reviewed everything that had\\n happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact\\n that her parents left her every summer while they\\n went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\\n think she would do?\\n“You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told\\n her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery\\n series you like. When they’re finished there are\\n plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\\n never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s\\n saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\\n them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\\n you love to read.”\\n“I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”\\nJudy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired\\n eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\\n vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\\n little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to\\n the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\\n was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\\n and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\\n went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\\n scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t\\n glad to have her.\\n“You here again?” she had greeted her that summer,\\n and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling\\n behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with\\n yourself this time?”\\n“Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say\\n you have a whole stack of old magazines—”\\n“In the attic. Go up and look them over if you\\n can stand the heat.”\\nJudy went, not to look over the old magazines so\\n much as to escape to a place where she could have a\\n good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\\n birthday. In another year she would have outgrown\\n her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or\\n be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\\n vacation of her own. In another year she would\\n be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\\n and solving a mystery to be known as the\\nGhost\\n Parade\\n.\\n“A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling\\n her, “and you solved everything.”\\nBut then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no\\n idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\\n seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears\\n came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\\n Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\\n on a picture of a fountain.\\n“A fountain with tears for water. How strange!”\\n she remembered saying aloud.\\nJudy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\\n walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\\n mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\\n fountain still caught and held rainbows like those\\n she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\\n But all that was in the future. If anyone had told\\n the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\\n day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\\n their faces.\\n“That tease!”\\nFor then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\\n used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\\n she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so\\n are you!”\\nPeter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a\\n kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\\n The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\\n summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\\n spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\\n she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\\n pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\\n all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\\n“But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly\\n exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”\\nA step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\\n it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\\n and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\\n “Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\\n know your wishes instead of muttering them to\\n yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”\\n“Were they?” asked Lois.\\nShe and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\\n Judy was telling them without interruption.\\n“That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.\\n “There weren’t any of them impossible.”\\nAnd she went on to tell them how, the very next\\n day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\\n exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\\n of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\\n Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the\\n water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\\n had stared at them a moment and then climbed the\\n steps to the pool.\\n“Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.\\n “Is this beautiful fountain real?”\\nA voice had answered, although she could see no\\n one.\\n“Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\\n shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\\n come true.”\\n“A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a\\n tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”\\n“Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\\n surely come true,” the voice had repeated.\\n“But what is there to cry about?”\\n“You found plenty to cry about back at your\\n grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded\\n her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up\\n there in the attic?”\\n“Then you—you\\nare\\nthe fountain!” Judy remembered\\n exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It\\n doesn’t have a voice.”\\n“Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had\\n said in a mysterious whisper.\\nCHAPTER II\\nIf Wishes Came True\\n“Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\\n “Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any\\n longer. What did you wish?”\\n“Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming\\n to that.”\\nFirst, she told her friends, she had to think of a\\n wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\\n those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\\n been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\\n away.\\n“You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of\\n having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody\\n in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\\n lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\\n and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\\n little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\\n they vanished, and so I began naming the things I\\n wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were\\n wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\\n wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\\n and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to\\n think of others that my wishes started to come true.”\\n“But what were they?” Lois insisted.\\nLorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\\n Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\\n airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots\\n of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\\n G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far\\n as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\\n spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything\\n more.”\\n“Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois\\n asked.\\n“Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more\\n things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\\n pets, and have a nice home, and—”\\n“And your wishes all came true!”\\n“Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one\\n about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I\\n wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\\n seemed impossible at the time, but the future did\\n hold a sister for me.”\\n“It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing\\n Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think\\n sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”\\n“Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then\\n it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter\\n or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t\\n know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the\\n strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”\\n“Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was\\n enchanted?”\\nLois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\\n answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so\\n at the time. I wandered around, growing very\\n drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\\n it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\\n waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\\n had been a dream.”\\n“A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it\\n wasn’t a flying carpet?”\\n“No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured\\n her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a\\n beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\\n with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”\\n“All the year around?”\\nAgain Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\\n “Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long\\n way from June to December.”\\n“Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy\\n said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any\\n time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\\n and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\\n I explored the garden all around the fountain.”\\n“And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.\\n“Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream\\n you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t\\n you try to solve the mystery?”\\n“I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if\\n I had been older or more experienced. I really should\\n have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\\n secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\\n away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t\\n really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\\n for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\\n impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine\\n was your friend.”\\n“I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.\\n “It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”\\n“It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\\n the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that\\n things started happening so fast that I completely\\n forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t\\n believe I thought about it again until after we moved\\n to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\\n saw the fountain on your lawn.”\\n“The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,”\\n Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”\\n“You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve\\n seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the\\n picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll\\n show you.”\\nLois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\\n Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.\\n Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had\\n tasted it too often while she was making it.\\n“I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.\\nLois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\\n the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\\n with cream.\\n“Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks\\n he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\\n lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\\n He wants to explore the attic, too.”\\n“He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there\\n are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.\\nLeaving the table, they all started upstairs with\\n the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\\n grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s\\n tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\\n removed. But there was still a door closing off the\\n narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\\n reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\\n“He can read my mind. He always knows where\\n I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and\\n the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\\n noise came from the floor above.\\n“Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid\\n of,” Judy urged her friends.\\n“Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,”\\n confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\\n room at the top of the last flight of stairs.\\n“So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious\\n about black cats, but they are creepy. Does\\n Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”\\n“Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy.\\n Pausing at still another door that led to the darker\\n part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\\n “Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\\n care to explore the past?”\\nThe exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\\n relating still more of what she remembered about\\n the fountain.\\n“When I told Grandma about it she laughed and\\n said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\\n true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would\\n she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this\\n house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\\n you see on that high shelf by the window. I think\\n she and Grandpa like the way they lived without\\n any modern conveniences or anything.”\\n“I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the\\n old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died\\n the same winter, isn’t it?”\\n“Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\\n wished neither of them would outlive the other. If\\n they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more\\n thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes.\\n Another could have been to keep the good old days,\\n as Grandma used to call them. That one came true\\n in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\\n past when they kept all these old things. That’s what\\n I meant about turning back the clock.”\\n“If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little\\n myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things\\n were the way they used to be when I trusted\\n Arthur—”\\n“Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.\\nAfterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\\n and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\\n she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\\n through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\\n was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\\n monster coming between her and her handsome husband,\\n Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\\n seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\\n in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\\n the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It\\n is. It’s the very same one.”\\n“But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!”\\n Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”\\n“I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m\\n sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly\\n to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\\n But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\\n If she did, she pretended not to.\\n“Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love\\n to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”\\n“I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.\\n “Do you recognize it, too?”\\n“I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little\\n more closely the picture they had found. “It looks\\n like the fountain on the Brandt estate.”\\n“The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.\\n “Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\\n all the way to Farringdon.”\\n“Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The\\n Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you\\n come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”\\n“Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine\\n back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\\n to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off\\n into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.\\n “I never thought it led to a house, though. There\\n isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\\n took?”\\n“Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?”\\n Lois suggested.\\nCHAPTER III\\nA Strange Encounter\\nLorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\\n trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\\n it under one condition. They were not to drive all\\n the way to the house which, she said, was just over\\n the hilltop. They were to park the car where no\\n one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\\n“But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.\\n“You’ll remember it, won’t you?”\\nJudy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure.\\n She and Lois both argued that it would be better to\\n inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\\n“She’d be glad to show us around. This way it\\n looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they\\n started off in the blue car she was driving.\\nIt was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\\n easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\\n and said if they did find the fountain she thought\\n she’d wish for one exactly like it.\\n“Well, you know what your grandmother said\\n about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you\\n let people know about them instead of muttering\\n them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”\\n“Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know\\n about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\\n be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\\n coat he gave me last year.”\\n“Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too\\n warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\\n trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\\n as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\\nThe trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\\n had covered the distance that had seemed such a\\n long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s\\n wagon.\\n“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve\\n just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t\\n think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\\n to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\\n queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s\\n old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\\n some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t\\n explain what happened afterwards. When I woke\\n up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\\n wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”\\n“How could they?” asked Lois.\\n“Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to\\n see how beautiful everything was before—”\\nAgain she broke off as if there were something\\n she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.\\n“Before what?” questioned Judy.\\n“Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\\n were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\\n but you never did explain how you got back home,”\\n Lorraine reminded her.\\n“Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it,\\n but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember\\n driving home along this road. You see, I thought my\\n grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\\n and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\\n There wasn’t a house in sight.”\\n“The Brandt house is just over the top of this next\\n hill,” Lois put in.\\n“I know. You told me that. Now I know why I\\n couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\\n tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\\n I followed it. There’s something about a path in\\n the woods that always tempts me.”\\n“We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\\n your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”\\n“Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where\\n the hammock was and then through an archway,”\\n Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes\\n peered out at me from unexpected places. I was\\n actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\\n There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard\\n the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he\\n was driving off without me.”\\n“He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise,\\n and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like\\n that?”\\n“I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\\n and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.\\n “The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\\n them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for\\n Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”\\n“I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they\\n turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\\n“Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s\\n another car coming.”\\nAs Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\\n ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\\n Judy until the car had passed. The man driving\\n it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\\n his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\\n long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\\n most of his hair.\\n“What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois\\n when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for\\n playing hide and seek?”\\n“I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine\\n begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there\\n any more.”\\n“Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\\n can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.\\nShe was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\\n more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\\nLois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\\n road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\\n of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\\n green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\\n The sky was gray with white clouds being driven\\n across it by the wind.\\n“There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can\\n see it over to the left. It looks like something out of\\n Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”\\n“It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder\\n what it is.”\\n“I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It\\n would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But\\n if there are new people living here they’ll never give\\n us permission.”\\n“We might explore it without permission,” Judy\\n suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends\\n as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\\n road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to\\n explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for\\n the fountain.”\\n“Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It\\n won’t be enchanted. I told you—”\\n“You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If\\n you know anything about the people who live here\\n now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\\n I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”\\n“I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do\\n know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember\\n Roger Banning from school, don’t you?\\n I’ve seen him around here. His family must have\\n acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on\\n the estate.”\\n“Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you\\n tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places\\n together.”\\n“It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.\\n “I was just out for a drive.”\\n“You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a\\n car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger\\n Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better\\n than that. I did know him slightly, but not from\\n school. The boys and girls were separated and went\\n to different high schools by the time we moved to\\n Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\\n lot better. He was in our young people’s group at\\n church.”\\n“Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer\\n mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”\\n“For what?” asked Judy.\\nLike Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\\n to gossip.\\n“Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\\n his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\\n business people. I think he forged some legal\\n documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\\n It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.\\nNow Judy did remember. It was something she\\n would have preferred to forget. She liked to think\\n she was a good judge of character, and she had taken\\n Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\\n never stoop to crime.\\n“I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,”\\n Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look\\n for it, or aren’t we?”\\n“Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I\\n just like to know what a tiger looks like before he\\n springs at me,” Judy explained.\\n“You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition\\n of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.\\n“I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who\\n seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling.\\n Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve\\n seen that character who drove down this road and,\\n for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\\n Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?”\\nLorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\\n evasively, “People don’t generally enter private\\n estates without an invitation. That’s all.”\\n“I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided,\\n “in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect\\n we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\\n of trespassing.”\\n“I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two\\n dark-coated figures strode down the road toward\\n them. “You drove right by a\\n NO TRESPASSING\\n sign,\\n and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to\\n meet us!”\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see\\n and smell them with ease.\\n\\n\\n My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise\\n in front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens\\n came in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of\\n them eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre\\n beings, but there\\'s barely a species anywhere that can resist the old\\n exhibitionist urge.\\n\\n\\n \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the\\n office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to\\n begin.\\n\\n\\n The name of the planet was MacTavish IV \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mif you went by the official\\n Terran listing\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m or Ghryne \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mif you called it by what its people were\\n accustomed to calling it\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV\\n and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals\\n happy wherever I go.\\n\\n\\n Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim\\n sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had\\n saturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding\\n arrival. Stuff like this:\\nWant to visit Earth—see the Galaxy\\'s most glittering and exclusive\\n world? Want to draw good pay, work short hours, experience the thrills\\n of show business on romantic Terra? If you are a non-terrestrial,\\n there may be a place for you in the Corrigan Institute of\\n Morphological Science. No freaks wanted—normal beings only. J. F.\\n Corrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday to\\n Fifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until\\n 2937, so don\\'t miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and riches\\n can be yours!\\nBroadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand\\n languages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really\\n packs in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It\\'s the best of its kind,\\n the only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the\\n other species of the universe.\\n\\n\\n The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, \"The first\\n applicant is ready to see you, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Send him, her or it in.\"\\n\\n\\n The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on\\n nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a\\n big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and\\n five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.\\n There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,\\n one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.\\nHis voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. \"You are Mr. Corrigan?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right.\" I reached for a data blank. \"Before we begin, I\\'ll need\\n certain information about—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am a being of Regulus II,\" came the grave, booming reply, even\\n before I had picked up the blank. \"I need no special care and I am not\\n a fugitive from the law of any world.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.\"\\n\\n\\n I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick\\n cough. \"Let me have that again, please?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The \\'R\\' stands for\\n Raymond.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, that\\'s not the name you were born with.\"\\n\\n\\n The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,\\n remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of\\n an apologetic smile. \"My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and\\n shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.\"\\nThe little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.\\n \"You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You\\'ll pay\\n for my services, transportation and expenses. I\\'ll be required to\\n remain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and\\n transportation.\"\\n\\n\\n The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping\\n on one side, two on the other. \"Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I\\n accept the terms!\"\\n\\n\\n I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were\\n signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into\\n the other office to sign him up.\\n\\n\\n I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show;\\n the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him\\n didn\\'t mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien\\n who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker\\n would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get\\n to Earth. My conscience won\\'t let me really\\nexploit\\na being, but I\\n don\\'t believe in throwing money away, either.\\n\\n\\n The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit\\n has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few\\n decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was\\n followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan\\'s Planet,\\n four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple\\n of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being\\n so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at\\n anything short of top rate.\\n\\n\\n Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a\\n handout than a job. If there\\'s any species we have a real over-supply\\n of, it\\'s those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it\\n a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn\\'t even get\\n the handout he was angling for. I don\\'t approve of begging.\\n\\n\\n The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the\\n Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had\\n figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.\\nIt was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into\\n the successful proprietor of Corrigan\\'s Institute, after some years\\n as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in\\n 2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial\\n beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.\\n\\n\\n Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down,\\n a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a\\n scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.\\n\\n\\n That\\'s what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is,\\n of course. A zoo. But we don\\'t go out and hunt for our specimens; we\\n advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth\\n once in his lifetime, and there\\'s only one way he can do it.\\n\\n\\n We don\\'t keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens\\n before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms.\\n My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I\\n reach that, I\\'ll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.\\n\\n\\n After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new\\n specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids,\\n fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no\\n less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.\\n\\n\\n It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a\\n Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some\\n 400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn\\'t see\\n how we could take one on. They\\'re gentle and likable beings, but their\\n upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any\\n old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.\\n\\n\\n \"One more specimen before lunch,\" I told Stebbins, \"to make it an even\\n dozen.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long\\n close look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took\\n another one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as\\n I could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was\\n tall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and\\n though he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look\\n about him. He said, in level Terran accents, \"I\\'m looking for a job\\n with your outfit, Corrigan.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s been a mistake. We\\'re interested in non-terrestrials only.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz\\n XIII.\"\\nI don\\'t mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the line\\n at getting bilked myself. \"Look, friend, I\\'m busy, and I\\'m not known\\n for my sense of humor. Or my generosity.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not panhandling. I\\'m looking for a job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then try elsewhere. Suppose you stop wasting my time, bud. You\\'re as\\n Earthborn as I am.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,\" he said smoothly. \"I\\n happen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists\\n anywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small\\n and little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary\\n fluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don\\'t you want me in your\\n circus?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. And it\\'s not a circus. It\\'s—\"\\n\\n\\n \"A scientific institute. I stand corrected.\"\\n\\n\\n There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I\\n guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on\\n his ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you\\'re from\\n such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not speaking. I\\'m a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just\\n the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate\\n back to colloquial speech.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin\\n a good yarn—but for my money, you\\'re really Sam Jones or Phil Smith\\n from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to\\n Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low\\n these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\"\\n\\n\\n He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You\\'re making a big\\n mistake. I\\'m just what your outfit needs. A representative of a\\n hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect!\\n Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—\"\\n\\n\\n I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated.\\n\\n\\n \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn\\'t much. I\\'ll be a big\\n attraction. I\\'ll—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nGood-by, Mr. Gorb!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to\\n the door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think\\n it over. Maybe you\\'ll regret your hastiness. I\\'ll be back to give you\\n another chance.\"\\n\\n\\n He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile.\\n This was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get\\n a job!\\n\\n\\n But I wasn\\'t buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness\\n intellectually. There\\'s no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there\\'s\\n only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some\\n real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket\\n home.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that\\n reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.\\nThe first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a\\n Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I\\n had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan,\\n and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds.\\n Hardly had the \\'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the\\n Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him\\n officially.\\n\\n\\n He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high,\\n and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three\\n stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,\\n and growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me\\n immediately to a contract.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will grant me a contract!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will you please sit down?\"\\n\\n\\n He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are\\n sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed\\n life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of\\n trouble.\\n\\n\\n The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They\\'re hairy creatures, and\\n this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his\\n body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket\\n of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his\\n warlike race.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"You\\'ll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it\\'s not our\\n policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our\\n Institute. And we\\'re not currently in need of any Kallerian males,\\n because—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\"\\n\\n\\n I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already\\n carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.\\n\\n\\n The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have\\n four representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn!\\n For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to\\n the noble Clan Gursdrinn!\"\\n\\n\\n At the key-word\\navenge\\n, I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian\\n in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he\\n didn\\'t move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to\\n Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\"\\nI\\'m a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and\\n one of the most important of those principles is that I never let\\n myself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally\\n insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\"\\n\\n\\n He glared at me in silence.\\n\\n\\n I went on, \"Please be assured that I\\'ll undo the insult at the earliest\\n possible opportunity. It\\'s not feasible for us to hire another\\n Kallerian now, but I\\'ll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon\\n as a vacancy—\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. You will hire me now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can\\'t be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I\\'ll\\n get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another\\n Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—\"\\n\\n\\n You\\'d think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a\\n zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there\\'s always\\n the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we\\'re insulting\\n all the others.\\n\\n\\n I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and\\n Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left.\\n They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him\\n away. He wasn\\'t minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked\\n them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw,\\n but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was\\n out in the hall.\\n\\n\\n I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next\\n applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped\\n open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.\\n\\n\\n \"Come here, you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stebbins?\" I said gently.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he\\n came running in—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you,\\n honored sir!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least\\n fifty ahead of him.\"\\n\"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he\\'s in here already, I might\\n as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\"\\n\\n\\n Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.\\nThe alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking\\n creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a\\n lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His\\n tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at\\n full volume.\\n\\n\\n \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a\\n being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel\\n to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with\\n yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I\\'d better tell you right at the outset that we\\'re already\\n carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a\\n female now and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?\"\\n\\n\\n I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian\\n entry. \"Yes, that\\'s her name.\"\\n\\n\\n The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she!\\n It is she!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid we don\\'t have room for any more—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress,\\n she is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life\\n and my love.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was\\n single. It\\'s right here on the chart.\"\\n\\n\\n \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors\\n of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry,\\n languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You\\nmust\\ntake me to\\n Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must\\n reason with her. Earthman, can\\'t you see I must appeal to her inner\\n flame?\\nI must bring her back!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n My face was expressionless. \"You don\\'t really intend to join our\\n organization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race,\\n if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead\\n lump of stone?\"\\nIt isn\\'t, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by\\n sentiment. I felt sorry for this being\\'s domestic troubles, but I\\n wasn\\'t going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel\\n happy—not to mention footing the transportation.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I don\\'t see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict\\n on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for\\n scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in\\n coming isn\\'t scientific, I can\\'t in all conscience\\nlie\\nfor you, can\\n I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right\\n along. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up,\\n I might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your\\n heart to me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought the truth would move you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It did. But in effect you\\'re now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent\\n criminal act. Friend, I can\\'t do it. My reputation means too much to\\n me,\" I said piously.\\n\\n\\n \"Then you will refuse me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can\\'t take you to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\"\\n\\n\\n There\\'s a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an\\n unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of\\n scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the\\n undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn\\'t pull a low\\n trick like that on our female Stortulian.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I\\'ll ask her about coming home. But I won\\'t ship her back\\n against her will. And maybe she\\'s happier where she is.\"\\n\\n\\n The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask\\n his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a\\n living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All\\n is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\"\\n\\n\\n He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping.\\n I watched him shuffle out. I do have\\nsome\\nconscience, and I had the\\n uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to\\n commit suicide on my account.\\nAbout fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life\\n started to get complicated again.\\n\\n\\n Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason\\n or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the\\n day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.\\n\\n\\n I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian\\'s\\n outraged pride and the Stortulian\\'s flighty wife when the door opened\\n and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII\\n stepped in.\\n\\n\\n \"How did\\nyou\\nget in here?\" I demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily.\\n \"Change your mind about me yet?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn\\'t changed your mind, so I\\'ve changed\\n my pitch a bit. If you won\\'t believe I\\'m from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I\\n tell you that I\\nam\\nEarthborn, and that I\\'m looking for a job on your\\n staff.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t care\\nwhat\\nyour story is! Get out or—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—you\\'ll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second.\\n Corrigan, you\\'re no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours\\n outside\\nis\\n. He doesn\\'t know how to handle alien beings. How many\\n times today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?\"\\n\\n\\n I scowled at him. \"Too damn many.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You see? He\\'s incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead.\\n I\\'ve been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to\\n know about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.\"\\n\\n\\n I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of\\n the office before I spoke. \"Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is,\\n I\\'ve had a hard day. There\\'s been a Kallerian in here who just about\\n threatened murder, and there\\'s been a Stortulian in here who\\'s about\\n to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it\\'s troubling\\n me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and\\n go home to Earth. I don\\'t want you hanging around here bothering me.\\n I\\'m not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to\\n claiming you\\'re an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is\\n that I\\'m not looking for any of\\nthose\\neither. Now will you scram or—\"\\n\\n\\n The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian,\\n came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering\\n metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding\\n a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came\\n dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry, Chief,\" Stebbins gasped. \"I tried to keep him out, but—\"\\n\\n\\n Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out\\n with a roar. \"Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!\"\\nSitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to\\n let him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\\n\\n\\n Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have\\n notified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the\\n death of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He\\'s going to—\"\\n\\n\\n An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun\\n trigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it\\n savagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the\\n sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of\\n bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\\n\\n\\n Before I could react to the big life-form\\'s hara-kiri, the office door\\n flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\\n green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\\n at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\\n\\n\\n \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Y-yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint\\n being—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the\\n untimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of\\n the Ghrynian policemen.\\n\\n\\n \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver\\n of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several\\n minutes ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest\\n you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\\n $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the\\n Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and\\nI\\'m\\nresponsible?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\\n this late life-form\\'s request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, no, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\\nClosing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them\\n away. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was\\n going to put an awful dent in this year\\'s take. And I shuddered when I\\n remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to\\n come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000\\n per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.\\n\\n\\n I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced\\n arrival.\\n\\n\\n The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway\\n and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian\\n policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a\\n moment and turned to eye the newcomer.\\n\\n\\n I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I\\n resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I\\ndid\\ncome, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against\\n crackpots.\\n\\n\\n In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer\\n worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me\\n to do.\"\\n\\n\\n I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers\\n going down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He\\'s going to kill himself!\\n He\\'s—\"\\n\\n\\n Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me\\n flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the\\n meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I\\n guess I wasn\\'t fully aware of what was going on.\\n\\n\\n Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole\\n in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I\\n saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The\\n man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting\\n himself off.\\n\\n\\n He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that\\n Stortulian wasn\\'t here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying\\n fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed\\n plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the\\n struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.\\n\\n\\n \"Evidently you don\\'t know as much as you think you do about Stortulian\\n psychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely\\n abhorrent to them. When they\\'re troubled, they kill the person who\\n caused their trouble. In this case, you.\"\\nI began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a\\n full-bodied laugh.\\n\\n\\n \"Funny,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"What is?\" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.\\n\\n\\n \"These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and\\n killed\\nhimself\\n, and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and\\n pathetic damn near blew my head off.\" I shuddered. \"Thanks for the\\n tackle job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t mention it,\" Gorb said.\\n\\n\\n I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take\\n that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn\\'t murder against the\\n local laws?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the\\n Ghrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian\\n and the fine of—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to\\n Stebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them\\n send down a legal adviser. Find out if there\\'s any way we can get out\\n of this mess with our skins intact.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.\\n\\n\\n Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can\\'t help\\n you. I can.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You?\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"I can get you out of this cheap.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nHow\\ncheap?\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a\\n specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That\\'s a heck of a\\n lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn\\'t\\n be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they\\n were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials\\n ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand,\\n giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You\\'ve got yourself a deal—but on\\n a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you\\'ll have five grand and\\n the contract. Otherwise, nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb shrugged. \"What have I to lose?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He moved his shoulders. \"I don\\'t\\n know, but maybe they range this far. Maybe they\\'re on this side of the\\n ridge, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. \"I\\'d hate to lose a day\\n crossing the ridge,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. \"Listen!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eh?\" Extrone said.\\n\\n\\n \"Hear it? That cough? I think that\\'s one, from over there. Right up\\n ahead of us.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct.\\n\\n\\n \"It is!\" Ri said. \"It\\'s a farn beast, all right!\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. \"I\\'m\\n glad we won\\'t have to cross the ridge.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll pitch camp right here, then,\" Extrone said. \"We\\'ll go after it\\n tomorrow.\" He looked at the sky. \"Have the bearers hurry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. \"You, there!\" he called.\\n \"Pitch camp, here!\"\\n\\n\\n He crossed to Mia, who, along with him, had been pressed into Extrone\\'s\\n party as guides. Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, \"Be quick, now!\"\\n And to Mia, \"God almighty, he was getting mad.\" He ran a hand under his\\n collar. \"It\\'s a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I\\'d\\n hate to think of making him climb that ridge.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia glanced nervously over his shoulder. \"It\\'s that damned pilot\\'s\\n fault for setting us down on this side. I told him it was the other\\n side. I told him so.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri shrugged hopelessly.\\n\\n\\n Mia said, \"I don\\'t think he even saw a blast area over here. I think he\\n wanted to get us in trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There shouldn\\'t be one. There shouldn\\'t be a blast area on this side\\n of the ridge, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s what I mean. The pilot don\\'t like businessmen. He had it in for\\n us.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri cleared his throat nervously. \"Maybe you\\'re right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s the Hunting Club he don\\'t like.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish to God I\\'d never heard of a farn beast,\" Ri said. \"At least,\\n then, I wouldn\\'t be one of his guides. Why didn\\'t he hire somebody\\n else?\"\\nMia looked at his companion. He spat. \"What hurts most, he pays us for\\n it. I could buy half this planet, and he makes me his guide—at less\\n than I pay my secretary.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, anyway, we won\\'t have to cross that ridge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, you!\" Extrone called.\\n\\n\\n The two of them turned immediately.\\n\\n\\n \"You two scout ahead,\" Extrone said. \"See if you can pick up some\\n tracks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said, and instantly the two of them readjusted their\\n shoulder straps and started off.\\n\\n\\n Shortly they were inside of the scrub forest, safe from sight. \"Let\\'s\\n wait here,\" Mia said.\\n\\n\\n \"No, we better go on. He may have sent a spy in.\"\\n\\n\\n They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not\\n professional guides.\\n\\n\\n \"We don\\'t want to get too near,\" Ri said after toiling through the\\n forest for many minutes. \"Without guns, we don\\'t want to get near\\n enough for the farn beast to charge us.\"\\n\\n\\n They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll want the bearers to hack a path for him,\" Mia said. \"But we go\\n it alone. Damn him.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. \"Hot.\\n By God, it\\'s hot. I didn\\'t think it was this hot, the first time we\\n were here.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia said, \"The first time,\\nwe\\nweren\\'t guides. We didn\\'t notice it so\\n much then.\"\\n\\n\\n They fought a few yards more into the forest.\\n\\n\\n Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay a\\n blast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but\\n the tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.\\n\\n\\n \"This isn\\'t ours!\" Ri said. \"This looks like it was made nearly a year\\n ago!\"\\n\\n\\n Mia\\'s eyes narrowed. \"The military from Xnile?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Ri said. \"They don\\'t have any rockets this small. And I don\\'t\\n think there\\'s another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we\\n leased from the Club. Except the one\\nhe\\nbrought.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?\" Mia\\n asked. \"You think it\\'s their blast?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So?\" Ri said. \"But who are they?\"\\nIt was Mia\\'s turn to shrug. \"Whoever they were, they couldn\\'t have been\\n hunters. They\\'d have kept the secret better.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We didn\\'t do so damned well.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We didn\\'t have a chance,\" Mia objected. \"Everybody and his brother had\\n heard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn\\'t\\n our fault Extrone found out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish we hadn\\'t shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead of\\n us.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"We should have shot our pilot,\\n too. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who told\\n Extrone we\\'d hunted this area.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t think a Club pilot would do that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"After Extrone said he\\'d hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to\\n the alien system? Listen, you don\\'t know.... Wait a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n There was perspiration on Ri\\'s upper lip.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nI\\ndidn\\'t tell Extrone, if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking,\" Mia said.\\n\\n\\n Ri\\'s mouth twisted. \"I didn\\'t say you did.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Mia said in a hoarse whisper. \"I just thought. Listen. To\\n hell with how he found out. Here\\'s the point. Maybe he\\'ll shoot us,\\n too, when the hunt\\'s over.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri licked his lips. \"No. He wouldn\\'t do that. We\\'re not—not just\\n anybody. He couldn\\'t kill us like that. Not even\\nhim\\n. And besides,\\n why would he want to do that? It wouldn\\'t do any good to shoot us. Too\\n many people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia said, \"I hope you\\'re right.\" They stood side by side, studying the\\n blast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, \"We better be getting back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'ll we tell him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?\"\\n\\n\\n They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.\\n\\n\\n \"It gets hotter at sunset,\" Ri said nervously.\\n\\n\\n \"The breeze dies down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s screwy. I didn\\'t think farn beasts had this wide a range. There\\n must be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There may be a pass,\" Mia said, pushing a vine away.\\n\\n\\n Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. \"I guess that\\'s it. If there were a lot\\n of them, we\\'d have heard something before we did. But even so, it\\'s\\n damned funny, when you think about it.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia looked up at the darkening sky. \"We better hurry,\" he said.\\nWhen it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low,\\n obviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the\\n outpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the\\n blazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over\\n Extrone\\'s tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled\\n into the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its\\n blasts.\\n\\n\\n Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat\\n disgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\\n\\n\\n Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking\\n officers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,\\n the officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and\\n knees almost stiff.\\n\\n\\n \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\\n\\n\\n They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\\n\\n\\n \"Haven\\'t I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone\\n demanded, ominously not raising his voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it\\'s another alien ship. It was sighted\\n a few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone\\'s face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there,\\n gentlemen? Why wasn\\'t it destroyed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So?\" Extrone mocked.\\n\\n\\n \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could\\n locate and destroy it.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned\\n away, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring\\n me a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I\\'m\\n staying here.\"\\n\\n\\n The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was\\n an alien ship around here then, wasn\\'t there? And you destroyed it,\\n didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said.\\n\\n\\n \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can\\'t slip through. But it might try a\\n long range bombardment, sir.\"\\nExtrone said, \"To begin with, they probably don\\'t even know I\\'m here.\\n And they probably couldn\\'t hit this area if they did know. And you\\n can\\'t afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s why we\\'d like you to return to an inner planet, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. \"You\\'ll\\n lose a fleet before you\\'ll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen.\\n I\\'m quite safe here, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n The bearer brought Extrone his drink.\\n\\n\\n \"Get off,\" Extrone said quietly to the four officers.\\n\\n\\n Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back.\\n Instead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the\\n tangle of forest.\\n\\n\\n Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area,\\n casting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot\\n breath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars.\\n\\n\\n Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed the empty glass away,\\n listened for it to shatter. He reached out, parted the heavy flap to\\n his tent.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir?\" Ri said, hurrying toward him in the gathering darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"Eh?\" Extrone said, turning, startled. \"Oh, you. Well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We ... located signs of the farn beast, sir. To the east.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, \"You killed one, I believe, on\\nyour\\ntrip?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri shifted. \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone held back the flap of the tent. \"Won\\'t you come in?\" he asked\\n without any politeness whatever.\\n\\n\\n Ri obeyed the order.\\n\\n\\n The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky feathers,\\n costly of transport space, the sleep curtains of silken gauze. The\\n floor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly\\n and smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the\\n left of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals.\\n They tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was\\n electric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to\\n the bed, sat down.\\n\\n\\n \"You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.\"\\nExtrone narrowed his eyes. \"I see by your eyes that you are\\n envious—that is the word, isn\\'t it?—of my tent.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri looked away from his face.\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps I\\'m envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have\\n never killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven\\'t\\nseen\\na farn beast.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone\\'s\\n glittering ones. \"Few people have seen them, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Extrone questioned mildly. \"I wouldn\\'t say that. I understand\\n that the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of their\\n planets.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I meant in our system, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course you did,\" Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of his\\n sleeve with his forefinger. \"I imagine these are the only farn beasts\\n in our system.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri waited uneasily, not answering.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Extrone said, \"I imagine they are. It would have been a shame if\\n you had killed the last one. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri\\'s hands worried the sides of his outer garment. \"Yes, sir. It would\\n have been.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone pursed his lips. \"It wouldn\\'t have been very considerate of you\\n to—But, still, you gained valuable experience. I\\'m glad you agreed to\\n come along as my guide.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was an honor, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone\\'s lip twisted in wry amusement. \"If I had waited until it was\\n safe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to\\n find such an illustrious guide.\"\\n\\n\\n \"... I\\'m flattered, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Extrone said. \"But you should have spoken to me about it,\\n when you discovered the farn beast in our own system.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity,\\n sir....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Extrone said dryly. \"Like all of my subjects,\" he waved\\n his hand in a broad gesture, \"the highest as well as the lowest slave,\\n know me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri squirmed, his face pale. \"We do indeed love you, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone bent forward. \"\\nKnow\\nme and love me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\\nKnow\\nyou and love you, sir,\" Ri said.\\n\\n\\n \"Get out!\" Extrone said.\\n\"It\\'s frightening,\" Ri said, \"to be that close to him.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia nodded.\\n\\n\\n The two of them, beneath the leaf-swollen branches of the gnarled tree,\\n were seated on their sleeping bags. The moon was clear and cold and\\n bright in a cloudless sky; a small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a\\n central mountain ridge that bisected it into almost twin hemispheres.\\n\\n\\n \"To think of him. As flesh and blood. Not like the—well; that—what\\n we\\'ve read about.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia glanced suspiciously around him at the shadows. \"You begin to\\n understand a lot of things, after seeing him.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri picked nervously at the cover of his sleeping bag.\\n\\n\\n \"It makes you think,\" Mia added. He twitched. \"I\\'m afraid. I\\'m afraid\\n he\\'ll.... Listen, we\\'ll talk. When we get back to civilization. You,\\n me, the bearers. About him. He can\\'t let that happen. He\\'ll kill us\\n first.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. \"No. We have friends. We have\\n influence. He couldn\\'t just like that—\"\\n\\n\\n \"He could say it was an accident.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Ri said stubbornly.\\n\\n\\n \"He can say anything,\" Mia insisted. \"He can make people believe\\n anything. Whatever he says. There\\'s no way to check on it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s getting cold,\" Ri said.\\n\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Mia pleaded.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Ri said. \"Even if we tried to tell them, they wouldn\\'t listen.\\n Everybody would\\nknow\\nwe were lying. Everything they\\'ve come to\\n believe would tell them we were lying. Everything they\\'ve read, every\\n picture they\\'ve seen. They wouldn\\'t believe us.\\nHe\\nknows that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Mia repeated intently. \"This is important. Right now he\\n couldn\\'t afford to let us talk. Not right now. Because the Army is\\n not against him. Some officers were here, just before we came back. A\\n bearer overheard them talking. They don\\'t\\nwant\\nto overthrow him!\"\\n\\n\\n Ri\\'s teeth, suddenly, were chattering.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s another lie,\" Mia continued. \"That he protects the people from\\n the Army. That\\'s a lie. I don\\'t believe they were\\never\\nplotting\\n against him. Not even at first. I think they\\nhelped\\nhim, don\\'t you\\n see?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri whined nervously.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s like this,\" Mia said. \"I see it like this. The Army\\nput\\nhim in\\n power when the people were in rebellion against military rule.\"\\nRi swallowed. \"We couldn\\'t make the people believe that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No?\" Mia challenged. \"Couldn\\'t we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?\\n You\\'ll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the\\n alien system!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The people won\\'t support them,\" Ri answered woodenly.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nThink.\\nIf he tells them to, they will. They trust him.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri looked around at the shadows.\\n\\n\\n \"That explains a lot of things,\" Mia said. \"I think the Army\\'s been\\n preparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That\\'s why\\n Extrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from\\n learning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep\\n them from exposing\\nhim\\nto the people. The aliens wouldn\\'t be fooled\\n like we were, so easy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No!\" Ri snapped. \"It was to keep the natural economic balance.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know that\\'s not right.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri lay down on his bed roll. \"Don\\'t talk about it. It\\'s not good to\\n talk like this. I don\\'t even want to listen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When the invasion starts, he\\'ll have to command\\nall\\ntheir loyalties.\\n To keep them from revolt again. They\\'d be ready to believe us, then.\\n He\\'ll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to\\n tell the truth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re wrong. He\\'s not like that. I know you\\'re wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n Mia smiled twistedly. \"How many has he already killed? How can we even\\n guess?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri swallowed sickly.\\n\\n\\n \"Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri shuddered. \"That\\'s different. Don\\'t you see? This is not at all like\\n that.\"\\nWith morning came birds\\' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells.\\n The air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike,\\n uncontaminated.\\n\\n\\n And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the\\n flap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around\\n the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.\\n\\n\\n \"Breakfast!\" he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding\\n table and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of\\n various foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher\\n and a drinking mug.\\n\\n\\n Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in his\\n conversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth with\\n water and spat on the ground.\\n\\n\\n \"Lin!\" he said.\\n\\n\\n His personal bearer came loping toward him.\\n\\n\\n \"Have you read that manual I gave you?\"\\n\\n\\n Lin nodded. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. \"Very\\n ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for\\n guides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me,\\n twenty years ago, damn them.\"\\n\\n\\n Lin waited.\\n\\n\\n \"Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n \"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I believe they\\'re carnivorous, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"An alien manual. That\\'s ludicrous, too. That we have the only\\n information on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual—and, of\\n course, two businessmen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of\\n tearing a man—\"\\n\\n\\n \"An alien?\" Extrone corrected.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an\\n alien to pieces, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone laughed harshly. \"It\\'s \\'sir\\' whenever you contradict me?\"\\n\\n\\n Lin\\'s face remained impassive. \"I guess it seems that way. Sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,\" Extrone said. \"But\\n you\\'re afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n Lin shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know how\\n wonderful it feels to have people\\nall\\nafraid of you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The farn beasts, according to the manual....\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are very insistent on one subject.\"\\n\\n\\n \"... It\\'s the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I\\n was saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of\\n aliens. Sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Extrone said, annoyed. \"I\\'ll be careful.\"\\n\\n\\n In the distance, a farn beast coughed.\\n\\n\\n Instantly alert, Extrone said, \"Get the bearers! Have some of them cut\\n a path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get\\n the hell over here!\"\\n\\n\\n Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.\\nFour hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked\\n leisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at\\n the vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their\\n sharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy\\n breathing.\\n\\n\\n Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank\\n deeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made\\n oppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\\n\\n\\n Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen\\n fought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks\\n for farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the\\n tree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\\n\\n\\n Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a\\n powerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained\\n fire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a\\n folding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered\\n two-way communication set.\\n\\n\\n Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny,\\n arboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to\\n Extrone\\'s satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\\n\\n\\n When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers\\n slump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume,\\n he sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted,\\n reflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\\n\\n\\n \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be\\n important.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The\\n bearer twiddled the dials.\\n\\n\\n \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother\\n me?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn\\'t\\n you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right\\n in the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t want to listen to your gabbling when I\\'m hunting!\" Extrone\\n tore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back,\\n find out what they want, first. I don\\'t want to be bothered unless it\\'s\\n important.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and\\n perspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\\n\\n\\n Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining\\n bearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\\n \"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About\\n a quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone\\'s eyes lit with passion.\\n\\n\\n Lin\\'s face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I\\n think.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward\\n and look at the spoor.\"\\n\\n\\n Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you\\'re going, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood\\n up.\\n\\n\\n \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n \"One is enough in\\nmy\\ncamp.\"\\nThe two of them went forward, alone, into the forest. Extrone moved\\n agilely through the tangle, following Lin closely. When they came to\\n the tracks, heavily pressed into drying mud around a small watering\\n hole, Extrone nodded his head in satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n \"This way,\" Lin said, pointing, and once more the two of them started\\n off.\\n\\n\\n They went a good distance through the forest, Extrone becoming more\\n alert with each additional foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with a\\n restraining hand. \"They may be quite a way ahead. Hadn\\'t we ought to\\n bring up the column?\"\\n\\n\\n The farn beast, somewhere beyond a ragged clump of bushes, coughed.\\n Extrone clenched the blast rifle convulsively.\\n\\n\\n The farn beast coughed again, more distant this time.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re moving away,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn!\" Extrone said.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a good thing the wind\\'s right, or they\\'d be coming back, and\\n fast, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eh?\" Extrone said.\\n\\n\\n \"They charge on scent, sight, or sound. I understand they will track\\n down a man for as long as a day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Extrone said, combing his beard. \"Wait a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look,\" Extrone said. \"If that\\'s the case, why do we bother tracking\\n them? Why not make them come to us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re too unpredictable. It wouldn\\'t be safe. I\\'d rather have\\n surprise on our side.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t seem to see what I mean,\" Extrone said. \"\\nWe\\nwon\\'t be\\n the—ah—the bait.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get back to the column.\"\\n\"Extrone wants to see you,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.\\n \"What\\'s he want to see\\nme\\nfor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know,\" Lin said curtly.\\n\\n\\n Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously\\n at Lin\\'s bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have—a\\n little money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to\\ndo\\nanything to me—I\\'d pay you, if you could....\"\\n\\n\\n \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning.\\n\\n\\n Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,\\n ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where\\n Extrone was seated, petting his rifle.\\n\\n\\n Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me\\n what they look like,\" he said suddenly.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sir, they\\'re ... uh....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pretty frightening?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But\\nyou\\nweren\\'t afraid of them, were you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir. No, because....\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good. I want you to do something for\\n me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I ... I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.\\n Lin\\'s face was impassive.\\n\\n\\n \"Of\\ncourse\\nyou will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin. A\\n good, long, strong rope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" Ri asked, terrified.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, I\\'m going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as\\n bait.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream—you\\ncan\\nscream,\\n by the way?\"\\n\\n\\n Ri swallowed.\\n\\n\\n \"We could find a way to make you.\"\\n\\n\\n There was perspiration trickling down Ri\\'s forehead, a single drop,\\n creeping toward his nose.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll be safe,\" Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. \"I\\'ll\\n shoot the animal before it reaches you.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri gulped for air. \"But ... if there should be more than one?\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone shrugged.\\n\\n\\n \"I—Look, sir. Listen to me.\" Ri\\'s lips were bloodless and his hands\\n were trembling. \"It\\'s not me you want to do this to. It\\'s Mia, sir.\\nHe\\nkilled a farn beast before\\nI\\ndid, sir. And last night—last\\n night, he—\"\\n\\n\\n \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.\\n\\n\\n Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir.\\n That\\'s what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.\\n He\\'s the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,\\n sir, it wouldn\\'t matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I\\n wouldn\\'t....\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That one. Right over there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The one with his back to me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. That\\'s him. That\\'s him, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle\\n and said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\"\\n\\n\\n Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don\\'t\\n want to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything\\n should happen to me.... Please, sir. Don\\'t do it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tie it,\" Extrone ordered.\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir. Please. Oh,\\nplease\\ndon\\'t, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tie it,\" Extrone said inexorably.\\n\\n\\n Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.\\nThey were at the watering hole—Extrone, Lin, two bearers, and Ri.\\n\\n\\n Since the hole was drying, the left, partially exposed bank was steep\\n toward the muddy water. Upon it was green, new grass, tender-tuffed,\\n half mashed in places by heavy animal treads. It was there that they\\n staked him out, tying the free end of the rope tightly around the base\\n of a scaling tree.\\n\\n\\n \"You will scream,\" Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed\\n across the water hole. \"The farn beast will come from this direction, I\\n imagine.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri was almost slobbering in fear.\\n\\n\\n \"Let me hear you scream,\" Extrone said.\\n\\n\\n Ri moaned weakly.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll have to do better than that.\" Extrone inclined his head toward\\n a bearer, who used something Ri couldn\\'t see.\\nRi screamed.\\n\\n\\n \"See that you keep it up that way,\" Extrone said. \"That\\'s the way I\\n want you to sound.\" He turned toward Lin. \"We can climb this tree, I\\n think.\"\\n\\n\\n Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark\\n peeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly.\\n\\n\\n Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert.\\n Lin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller\\n crotch.\\n\\n\\n Looking down, Extrone said, \"Scream!\" Then, to Lin, \"You feel the\\n excitement? It\\'s always in the air like this at a hunt.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I feel it,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n Extrone chuckled. \"You were with me on Meizque?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That was something, that time.\" He ran his hand along the stock of the\\n weapon.\\n\\n\\n The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled\\n Extrone\\'s head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet,\\n underlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri\\'s\\n screams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly. Lin sat quiet, hunched.\\n\\n\\n Extrone\\'s eyes narrowed, and he began to pet the gun stock with quick,\\n jerky movements. Lin licked his lips, keeping his eyes on Extrone\\'s\\n face. The sun seemed stuck in the sky, and the heat squeezed against\\n them, sucking at their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away.\\n Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed.\\nA farn beast coughed, far in the matted forest.\\n\\n\\n Extrone laughed nervously. \"He must have heard.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re lucky to rouse one so fast,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n Extrone dug his boot cleats into the tree, braced himself. \"I like\\n this. There\\'s more excitement in waiting like this than in anything I\\n know.\"\\n\\n\\n Lin nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"The waiting, itself, is a lot. The suspense. It\\'s not only the killing\\n that matters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not\\nonly\\nthe killing,\" Lin echoed.\\n\\n\\n \"You understand?\" Extrone said. \"How it is to wait, knowing in just a\\n minute something is going to come out of the forest, and you\\'re going\\n to kill it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s not only the killing. It\\'s the waiting, too.\"\\n\\n\\n The farn beast coughed again; nearer.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a different one,\" Lin said.\\n\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hear the lower pitch, the more of a roar?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Extrone shouted. \"You, down there. There are two coming. Now\\n let\\'s hear you really scream!\"\\n\\n\\n Ri, below, whimpered childishly and began to retreat toward the tether\\n tree, his eyes wide.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a lot of satisfaction in fooling them, too,\" Extrone said.\\n \"Making them come to your bait, where you can get at them.\" He\\n opened his right hand. \"Choose your ground, set your trap. Bait it.\"\\n He snapped his hand into a fist, held the fist up before his eyes,\\n imprisoning the idea. \"Spring the trap when the quarry is inside.\\n Clever. That makes the waiting more interesting. Waiting to see if they\\n really will come to your bait.\"\\n\\n\\n Lin shifted, staring toward the forest.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve always liked to hunt,\" Extrone said. \"More than anything else, I\\n think.\"\\n\\n\\n Lin spat toward the ground. \"People should hunt because they have to.\\n For food. For safety.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Extrone argued. \"People should hunt for the love of hunting.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Killing?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hunting,\" Extrone repeated harshly.\\nThe farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and\\n there was a noise of crackling underbrush.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s good bait,\" Extrone said. \"He\\'s fat enough and he knows how to\\n scream good.\"\\n\\n\\n Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully\\n eying the forest across from the watering hole.\\n\\n\\n Extrone began to tremble with excitement. \"Here they come!\"\\n\\n\\n The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his\\n lap.\\n\\n\\n The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank,\\n swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed.\\n Its mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs\\n behind them, rattling leaves.\\n\"Shoot!\" Lin hissed. \"For God\\'s sake, shoot!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Extrone said. \"Let\\'s see what they do.\" He had not moved\\n the rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath\\n beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.\\n\\n\\n The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.\\n\\n\\n \"Look!\" Extrone cried excitedly. \"Here it comes!\"\\n\\n\\n Ri began to scream again.\\n\\n\\n Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin\\n waited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.\\n\\n\\n The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing\\n a sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.\\n\\n\\n \"Watch! Watch!\" Extrone cried gleefully.\\n\\n\\n And then the aliens sprang their trap.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

WALLACE\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by EMSH\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nMan\\'s family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic\\n \\nrace an inferiority complex—but then he tried to climb it!\\nIn repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a\\n package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\\n his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\\n was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\\n his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\\n though narrower ribbons.\\n\\n\\n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\\n imitation of speech. \"Yes, I\\'ve heard the legend.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\\n not unexpected—non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\\n speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of\\n humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\\n widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\\n ages before space travel—\\nand yet each planetary race can interbreed\\n with a minimum of ten others\\n! That\\'s more than a legend—one hell of a\\n lot more!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly\\n distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\\n species.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s because you\\'re unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own\\n world, there\\'s nothing like your species, except superficially, and\\n that\\'s true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\\n exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it\\'s\\n accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\\n development.\\n\"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\\n beginning of the scale. I\\'m from Earth, near the middle, though on\\n Emmer\\'s side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\\n And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There\\'s\\n a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\\n breed with my kind, but there\\'s a fair chance that I\\'d be fertile with\\n Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\\n extend to Kelburn.\"\\nTaphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was\\n proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an\\n unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind\\n of planet. It\\'s reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\\n hundred such worlds, they\\'d seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\\n few of them. That\\'s what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\\n actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\\n stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\\n\\n\\n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\\n Stone Age aren\\'t related to anything else there. We have to conclude\\n that Man didn\\'t originate on any of the planets on which he is now\\n found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout\\n this section of the Milky Way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across\\n thousands of light-years, you\\'ve brought in the big ancestor,\"\\n commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\\n\\n\\n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it\\'s not the\\n result of parallel evolution—not when a hundred human races are\\n involved, and\\nonly\\nthe human race.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his\\n ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man\\'s theories\\n about himself.\"\\n\\n\\n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous\\n though not always the most advanced—Ribboneers had a civilization as\\n high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\\n others—and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\\n together—but they hadn\\'t except in agreement as to their common origin.\\n\\n\\n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\\n very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\\n helping him make up his mind. \"You\\'ve heard of the adjacency mating\\n principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\\n\\n\\n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they\\'ve been around men.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\\n that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\\n We\\'ve got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\\n race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\\n fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\\n their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\\n was a little further along. When we project back into time those star\\n systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\\n pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\\n\\n\\n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\\n change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\\n was interested.\\nKelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\\n stars in the Milky Way, but though we\\'ve explored only a small portion\\n of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\\n\\n\\n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We\\'re\\n looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\\n today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\\n for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\\n There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\\n Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\\n together, there\\'s also a random motion. Here\\'s what happens when we\\n calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\\n\\n\\n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\\n the motion.\\n\\n\\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\\n equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn\\'t\\n close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\\n\\n\\n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\\n\\n\\n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And that\\'s the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\\n humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\\n with those they were adjacent to\\ntwo hundred thousand years ago\\n!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The adjacency mating principle. I\\'ve never seen it demonstrated,\"\\n murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\\n satisfies the calculations?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\\n that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\\n representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\\n other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\\n mammals, we\\'re able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\\n The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we\\'ve got the\\n time right.\"\\n\\n\\n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\\n ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We\\'ve narrowed it down to several cubic\\n light-years—then. Now it\\'s far more. And, of course, if it were a\\n fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\\n exploration. But we\\'re certain we\\'ve got a good chance of finding it\\n this trip.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\\n visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\\n \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it\\'s not math, you\\'d\\n better ask Halden. He\\'s the leader of the expedition.\"\\n\\n\\n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn\\'t necessary. It was true that Kelburn\\n was the most advanced human type present, but while there were\\n differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn\\'t\\n as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren\\'t trained in\\n the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\\n lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\\n there was the matter of training; he\\'d been on several expeditions and\\n this was Kelburn\\'s first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\\n respect.\\n\\n\\n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\\n your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We didn\\'t. The man became sick and required treatment we can\\'t give\\n him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it\\'s four\\n months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\\n us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\\n have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\\n we\\'re heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We\\'d prefer to\\n have an expert—and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\\n ability.\"\\n\\n\\n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\\n plans, but I can\\'t evade professional obligations, and an emergency\\n such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\\n the incentives?\"\\n\\n\\n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We\\'ve copied the\\n Ribboneer\\'s standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\\n cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist\\'s share of the\\n profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\\n \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\\n you\\'ll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\\n roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\\n\\n\\n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\\n\\n\\n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\\n you all day—it\\'s micro-printing. However, you needn\\'t be afraid that\\n I\\'m defrauding you. It\\'s honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\\n everywhere in this sector—places men have never been.\"\\n\\n\\n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\\n integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\\n\\n\\n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they\\'ll forward it\\n for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\\n ribbons together. \"Now if you\\'ll get me the charts, I\\'ll examine the\\n region toward which we\\'re heading.\"\\nFirmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and\\n an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his\\n eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the\\n mating scale, he shouldn\\'t have been so interested. But his planet had\\n been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn\\'t completely aware of\\n his place in the human hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,\\n wouldn\\'t have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how\\n long and beautiful a woman\\'s legs could be. Her people had never given\\n much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy\\n to see why.\\n\\n\\n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the\\n biologist. \"The pilot doesn\\'t like our air.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then change it to suit him. He\\'s in charge of the ship and knows more\\n about these things than I do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed\\n to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still\\n complains.\"\\nHalden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn\\'t got lungs. He breathes\\n through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\\n\\n\\n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn\\'t a worm, that his\\n evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense\\n less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher\\n humans hadn\\'t developed as much as lower races and actually weren\\'t\\n prepared for the multitude of life-forms they\\'d meet in space. Firmon\\'s\\n reaction was quite typical.\\n\\n\\n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it\\'s because his system needs it,\" said\\n Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do\\n something about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hydroponics is your job. There\\'s nothing\\nI\\ncan do.\" Halden paused\\n thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\\n\\n\\n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something\\'s chewing them down as\\n fast as they grow.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Insects? There shouldn\\'t be any, but if there are, we\\'ve got sprays.\\n Use them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now\\n they won\\'t touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The\\n animals seem to know what they are and we\\'ve never caught one that\\n way.\"\\n\\n\\n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"About three months. It\\'s not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\\n\\n\\n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship\\n was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.\\n \"I don\\'t know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of\\n places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with\\n new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There\\'s nothing we can\\n do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\\n\\n\\n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place\\n just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices\\n everywhere that couldn\\'t be closed off without rebuilding.\\n\\n\\n They couldn\\'t set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down\\n because there weren\\'t that many men to spare. Besides, the use of\\n weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were\\n trying to protect than to the pest. He\\'d have to devise other ways.\\n\\n\\n Sam Halden got up. \"I\\'ll take a look and see what I can do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and\\n leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of\\n privileges.\"\\n\\n\\n Halden started. So she\\nknew\\nthat the crew was calling her that!\\n Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn\\'t\\n said it. It didn\\'t help the situation at all.\\nTaphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,\\n he wouldn\\'t have fitted. Maybe it wasn\\'t sitting, but his flat legs\\n were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on\\n the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never\\n quite still.\\n\\n\\n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech\\n tells me you\\'re contemplating an experiment. I don\\'t like it.\"\\n\\n\\n Halden shrugged. \"We\\'ve got to have better air. It might work.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pests on the ship? It\\'s filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Neither do we.\"\\n\\n\\n The Ribboneer\\'s distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have a description, though I\\'ve never seen one. It\\'s a small\\n four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A\\n typical pest.\"\\n\\n\\n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.\\n \"Considering how far we\\'ve come, it may have been any one of a half\\n a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had\\n access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard\\n radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are\\n possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It\\'s\\n developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things\\n it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it\\'s\\n smarter?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be\\n so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait\\'s\\n strong enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s what I don\\'t like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it\\n over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I\\'m curious about\\n humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical\\n ancestor?\"\\n\\n\\n Emmer didn\\'t look like the genius he was—a Neanderthal genius, but\\n nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a\\n stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy\\n hands through shaggier hair.\\n\\n\\n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world\\n with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of\\n their camp.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all\\n humans—late or early and male or female—look remarkably alike. If you\\n are an archeologist, that\\'s enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his\\n speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\"\\nEmmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You\\'ve never seen any pictures?\\n Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\\n we\\'d give something to know what they\\'re made of. Presumably my world\\n was one of the first they stopped at. They weren\\'t used to roughing\\n it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\\n structures and that\\'s how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\\n forty feet high.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\\n impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\\n not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\\n a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\\n thousand years—and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\\n \"But they didn\\'t leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\\n ours. They may have thought we\\'d be better off without it. We do know\\n they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\\n they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\\n never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\\n long-lived, and maybe they couldn\\'t survive on any planet they found.\\n Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn\\'t the kind of planet\\n they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\\n advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\\n plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\\n did.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\\n\\n\\n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\\n independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\\n late species. It\\'s well known that individuals among my people are\\n often as bright as any of Halden\\'s or Meredith\\'s, but as a whole we\\n don\\'t have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we\\'re as\\n advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\\n planets we live on and it\\'s hard to say just what it is.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What happened to those who didn\\'t develop space travel?\" asked\\n Taphetta.\\n\\n\\n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\\n\\n\\n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\\n or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\\n atomic—because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\\n for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren\\'t actually\\n aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\\n aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\\n was tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\\nTaphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this\\n discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\\n\\n\\n It was Halden who answered him. \"There\\'s the satisfaction of knowing\\n where we came from.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment\\n was required for this expedition. I can\\'t believe that the educational\\n institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual\\n curiosity.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?\\n When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than\\n physiology is changed—the pattern of life itself is altered. Things\\n that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in\\n cultural discoveries.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced\\n civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we\\'ve\\n achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\\n \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,\\n but wouldn\\'t you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\\n\\n\\n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn\\'t find a suitable planet. So,\\n working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and\\n produced us. They\\nwere\\nmaster biologists.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your\\n fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you\\'ve built\\n up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling\\n fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don\\'t like to, but we\\'ll have to risk\\n using bait for your pest.\"\\n\\n\\n He\\'d have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot\\'s\\n consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been\\n bothering him vaguely. \"What\\'s the difference between the Ribboneer\\n contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To the individual, they are, but it won\\'t matter if you discover as\\n much as you think you will. The difference is this:\\nMy\\nterms don\\'t\\n permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\\n\\n\\n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding\\n anything. Halden examined his own attitudes.\\nHe\\nhadn\\'t intended, but\\n could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?\\n He couldn\\'t, and it was too late now—whatever knowledge they acquired\\n would have to be shared.\\n\\n\\n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of—there was one kind of\\n technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could\\n improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start\\n that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn\\'t worry now.\\n\"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing\\n up. \"I\\'d rather be in hydroponics.\"\\n\\n\\n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound\\n animals, but they\\'re warier. They don\\'t come out when anyone\\'s near.\"\\n\\n\\n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with\\n it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the\\n two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a\\n miniature keyboard.\\n\\n\\n \"Ready?\"\\n\\n\\n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you\\'ve rehearsed. Keep noise at\\n a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don\\'t try to imitate them\\n exactly.\"\\n\\n\\n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape\\n crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming\\n forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open\\n floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\\n\\n\\n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the\\n side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began\\n nibbling what it could reach.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another\\n shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one\\n retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped\\n and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up\\n and mauled the other unmercifully.\\nIt continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it\\n backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.\\n Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within\\n reach, it climbed into the branches.\\n\\n\\n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging\\n itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no\\n noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying\\n away, still within range of the screen.\\n\\n\\n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top\\n and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed\\n around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as\\n it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent\\n defeat.\\n\\n\\n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and\\n landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal\\n heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping\\n the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\\n\\n\\n The small one stood still till the last instant—and then a paw\\n flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of\\n the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.\\n The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped\\n moving.\\n\\n\\n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its\\n foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been\\n found—\\nand laid it down\\n.\\nAt Halden\\'s signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too\\n bright for anything to be visible.\\n\\n\\n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don\\'t want the pests to find out\\n that the bodies aren\\'t flesh.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their\\n machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did we? I didn\\'t notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\\n exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don\\'t\\n have to identify them as their species. If they\\'re smart enough,\\n they\\'ll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What if they\\'re smarter? Suppose they know a knife can\\'t be used by a\\n creature without real hands?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s part of our precautions. They\\'ll never know until they try—and\\n they\\'ll never get away from the trap to try.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I\\n like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of\\n marrying you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew\\n that, in relation to her, he was\\nnot\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s almost a curse, isn\\'t it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by\\n leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\\n\\n\\n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To\\n her, I\\'m merely a passionate savage.\\n\\n\\n They went to his cabin.\\n\\n\\n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\\n wasn\\'t tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\\n long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\\n except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\\n the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\\n development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\\n the violet end of the spectrum.\\n\\n\\n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\\n primeval Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\\n her own world. She had something else in mind.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I will, though. We might have children.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I\\'m as intelligent as you. We wouldn\\'t\\n have subhuman monsters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It would be a step up—for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\\n It had been there as long as he\\'d known her, but it was closer to the\\n surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\\n them start lower than I am?\"\\n\\n\\n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\\n it governed personal relations between races that were united against\\n non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\\n\\n\\n \"Because you\\'re afraid I\\'d refuse.\"\\n\\n\\n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\\n permanent union.\\n\\n\\n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\\n\\n\\n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can\\'t let it\\n lead me astray.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you\\'re going to be scientific\\n about it, he\\'d give you children of the higher type.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kelburn.\" It didn\\'t sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don\\'t\\n like him and he wouldn\\'t marry me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He wouldn\\'t, but he\\'d give you children if you were humble enough.\\n There\\'s a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\\nShe provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn\\'s race\\n had a body like hers and she knew it.\\n\\n\\n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and\\n I would be infertile.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act\\n unconcerned.\\n\\n\\n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique\\n smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\\n\\n\\n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction\\n was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh\\n give when his knuckles struck it.\\n\\n\\n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took\\n it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front\\n of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I\\'ll have to stop the\\n blood and pain.\"\\n\\n\\n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She\\n closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back\\n and looked at herself critically.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s set and partially knitted. I\\'ll concentrate tonight and have it\\n healed by morning.\"\\n\\n\\n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across\\n the bridge. Then she came over to him.\\n\\n\\n \"I wondered what you\\'d do. You didn\\'t disappoint me.\"\\n\\n\\n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,\\n invisible or not, didn\\'t improve her appearance any. How could he still\\n feel that attraction to her?\\n\\n\\n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He\\'ll find you irresistible, and\\n he\\'s even more savage than I am.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too\\n much, though. You\\'re just right.\"\\n\\n\\n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what\\n Emmer would do—and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of\\n the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage—what\\n advantage?—for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,\\n nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the\\n higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he\\n wanted her.\\n\\n\\n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love\\'s enough, I may marry\\n you in spite of everything. But you\\'ll have to watch out whose children\\n I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\\n\\n\\n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not\\n completely her fault. Besides....\\n\\n\\n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior\\n children—and they might be his.\\n\\n\\n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were\\n they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime\\n toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over—no,\\nthrough\\n—everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry—onward and\\n upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger\\n was turned.\\n\\n\\n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You\\'ve already\\n broken it once.\"\\n\\n\\n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\\n delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\\n ocean at last.\\n\\n\\n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\\n sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\\n of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\\n to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\\n\\n\\n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\\n whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\\n some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\\n the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\\n He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\\n clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\\n how tall the trees really were.\\n\\n\\n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\\n the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\\n had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\\n its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\\n heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\\n nimbi.\\n\\n\\n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\\n hurried toward the ocean.\\n\\n\\n If only the days weren\\'t so short! he thought. There was so much to\\n see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\\n the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\\n brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\\n remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\\n as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\\n were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\\n play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\\n three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\\n kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\\n\\n\\n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\\n day just for him. And who could say it wasn\\'t? he thought. Wasn\\'t this\\n his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\\n even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\\n wouldn\\'t dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\\n the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\\n care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When\\n Purnie had stopped time, the bees—like all the other creatures he\\n met—had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as\\n soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off.\\nWhen he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\\n off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\\n clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\\n had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\\n far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\\n hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\\n He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\\n time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\\n\\n\\n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\\n when they learned of his brave journey.\\n\\n\\n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\\n gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\\n during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\\n dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\\n\\n\\n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\\n\\n\\n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\\n out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\\n awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\\n the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\\n exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\\n orange curls waiting to start that action.\\n\\n\\n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\\n frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\\n heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\\n in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\\n beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\\n the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\\n more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\\n animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\\n nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\\n tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\\n of munching seaweed.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\\n he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\\n time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\\n continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\\n\"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he\\n expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\\n activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\\n the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\\n continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\\n\\n\\n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\\n picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\\n their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\\n pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\\n delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\\n interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\\n with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\\n not the world around him.\\n\\n\\n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\\n tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\\n\\n\\n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\\n bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\\n position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\\n done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\\n mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\\n\\n\\n The tripon thought Purnie\\'s feat was superb. It stopped munching long\\n enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\\n repast.\\n\\n\\n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\\n once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\\n to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\\n the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\\n there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\\n\\n\\n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes\\n seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\\n\\n\\n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are\\n you going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in\\n San Diego?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie\\'s invitation got nothing more than\\n startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.\\n He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,\\n tagging along at their heels. \"I\\'ve got my lunch, want some?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, you\\'d better tell your men back there to stop gawking at\\n the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn\\'t pay for this\\n expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\\nThe animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\\n their heels.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it\\'s\\n your money that put us here; it\\'s your expedition all the way. But you\\n hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that\\'s just\\n what I\\'ve done. My job isn\\'t over yet. I\\'m responsible for the safety\\n of the men while we\\'re here, and for the safe trip home.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Precisely. And since you\\'re responsible, get \\'em working. Tell \\'em to\\n bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the\\n ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good God, man, aren\\'t you human? We\\'ve only been on this planet twenty\\n minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find\\n wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little\\n creatures that run up to us like we\\'re long-lost brothers. Let the men\\n look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\\n\\n\\n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\\n will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\\n joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\\n he got an upside down view of them walking away.\\n\\n\\n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\\n What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\\n more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\\n trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\\n his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\\n\\n\\n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\\n went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\\n\\n\\n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\\n vicinity. He\\'s trying to locate it now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make\\n you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That\\'ll make eighteen, I\\n believe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Radiation, bah! We\\'ve found low-grade ore on every planet I\\'ve\\n discovered so far, and this one\\'ll be no different. Now how about that\\n flag? Let\\'s get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes\\'s pennant raised and his\\n claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\\n now!\"\\nWhen the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\\n first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Benson, you won\\'t have to look far for materials to use for the\\n base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t use them. They\\'re petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\\n to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\\n slide down on top of us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well—that\\'s your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\\n solid. It\\'s got to stand at least—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, Forbes, we\\'ll get your monument erected. What\\'s this with\\n the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\\n flag.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There is, there is. Much more. I\\'ve taken care of all requirements set\\n down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\\n represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\\n is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\\n sentiment if you will.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry, I won\\'t. I\\'ve seen real-estate flags before.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\\n What I\\'m doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. And if I\\'m not mistaken, you\\'ve set up a neat little escrow\\n system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\\n the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\\n It\\'s people like me who pay your way. It\\'s people like me who give your\\n space ships some place to go. It\\'s people like me who pour good money\\n into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\\n thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I imagine you\\'ll triple your money in six months.\"\\n\\n\\n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\\n the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\\n as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\\n himself, content to be in their company.\\n\\n\\n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\\n the remainder of the group running toward them.\\n\\n\\n \"Captain Benson! Here\\'s the flag, sir. And here\\'s Miles with the\\n scintillometer. He says the radiation\\'s getting stronger over this way!\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about that, Miles?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This thing\\'s going wild, Captain. It\\'s almost off scale.\"\\nPurnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.\\n Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"\\n He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful\\n noises, and he felt most satisfied.\\n\\n\\n \"Stand back, Captain! Here\\'s the source right here! This little\\n chuck-walla\\'s hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I\\'ll be damned! Now what do you\\n suppose—\"\\n\\n\\n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard\\n put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he\\n stood on one leg.\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\\n\\n\\n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,\\n they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of\\n these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools\\n on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I\\'ll have investors\\nflocking\\nto me. How about it, Benson—does pioneering pay off or\\n doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be\\n great danger to the crew—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now look here! You had planned to put\\nmineral\\nspecimens in a lead\\n box, so what\\'s the difference? Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll die.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and\\n what\\'s more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day\\n had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,\\n the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle\\n happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their\\n own tricks.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped\\n back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.\\n Purnie sat up to watch the show.\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Captain, why don\\'t I just pick him up? Looks like he has no\\n intention of running away.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you\\'re shielded, no telling what\\n powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I swear he knows what we\\'re saying. Look at those eyes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That\\'s a boy!\"\\nPurnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\\n imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn\\'t know\\n what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\\n wiggled in anticipation.\\n\\n\\n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\\n it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\\n surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\\n Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\\n protect himself.\\n\\n\\n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\\n attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\\n had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\\n into the little crowd. \"I\\'ve got my lunch, want some?\"\\n\\n\\n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\\n and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\\n He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\\n few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\\n to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\\n deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\\n\\n\\n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\\n\\n\\n \"There you are, boys. It\\'s all in knowing how. Just winged him, that\\'s\\n all. Now pick him up.\"\\n\\n\\n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie\\'s misery lay in his confusion.\\n What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\\n again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\\n power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\\n following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\\n directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\\n ordered the stoppage of time.\\n\\n\\n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\\n motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\\n transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\\n himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\\n understand.\\n\\n\\n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\\n to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\\n wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\\n he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\\n in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\\n end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal\\'s head.\\n He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\\n hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\\n Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\\n to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\\n explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\\n stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\\n three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\\n\\n\\n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\\n torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\\n country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\\n animals.\\n\\n\\n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\\n with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\\n with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn\\'t fit\\n into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\\n long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\\n didn\\'t dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\\n fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\\n abused this faculty.\\nWhen Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\\n open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the\\n spot where Purnie had been standing.\\n\\n\\n \"My God, he\\'s—he\\'s gone.\"\\n\\n\\n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\\n hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\\n \"All right, you people, what\\'s going on here? Get him in that box. What\\n did you do with him?\"\\n\\n\\n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\\n to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\\n was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\\n in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\\n\\n\\n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn\\'t that him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'ll be damned!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Benson, I\\'m holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\\n you\\'ve botched it up, I\\'ll bring him down my own way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There\\'s something about that\\n fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\\n gun!\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\\n friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\\n Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\\n distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\\n the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\\n filled him with hysteria.\\n\\n\\n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\\n Others were pinned down on the sand.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I\\'m sorry! Can\\'t you hear?\" He\\n hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\\n shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\\n his ears from the beach. \"You\\'re getting all wet! Did you hear me?\\n Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\\n done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\\n tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\\n about.\\n\\n\\n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\\nPurnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.\\n The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of\\n death.\\n\\n\\n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I—I can\\'t move, Captain. My leg, it\\'s.... My God, we\\'re going to\\n drown!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us\\n here in the water—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he\\'s—\" His sounds were cut off by a\\n wavelet gently rolling over his head.\\n\\n\\n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the\\n animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding\\n the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\\n\\n\\n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\\n tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\\n slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far\\n as his friends\\' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\\n of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\\n he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,\\n where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The\\n hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the\\n logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\\n\\n\\n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\\n\\n\\n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after\\n another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he\\n started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\\n He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\\n position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\\n Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\\n a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\\n chaotic scene before him.\\n\\n\\n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\\n him.\\n\\n\\n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\\n time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\\n him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\\n he knew he must first resume time.\\n\\n\\n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\\n to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\\n late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\\n knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\\n\\n\\n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\\n time to resume, nothing happened.\\n\\n\\n His heart sank. He wasn\\'t afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\\n the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\\n wanted to see them safe.\\n\\n\\n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no\\nurging\\ntime to start. He knew he couldn\\'t persuade it by bits and pieces,\\n first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn\\'t. He\\n had to take one viewpoint or the other.\\n\\n\\n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took\\n command....\\nHis friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\\n and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\\n Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\\n What\\'s happening?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too. We\\'re either\\n crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not the logs. How about us? How\\'d we get out of the water? Miles,\\n we\\'re both cracking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m telling you, man, it\\'s the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.\\n I was looking right at them. First they\\'re on top of me, then they\\'re\\n piled up over there!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Damnit, the logs didn\\'t pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain\\n Benson!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you men all right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes sir, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid we\\'re not seeing right, Captain. Those logs—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We\\'ve got to round up the\\n others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, Rhodes, don\\'t you think I\\'d like to know? Those logs are so old\\n they\\'re petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn\\'t lift one. It would\\n take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so\\n busy eating seaweed—\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, let\\'s bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can\\'t\\n walk. Where\\'s Forbes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or\\n laughing. I can\\'t tell which.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all\\n right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they\\'ll\\n do anything I say! This one\\'s got a mind of its own. Did you see that\\n little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\\n\\n\\n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he\\'ll either kill himself or one\\n of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We\\'ll be along\\n shortly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I\\'m holding you personally responsible\\n for this. Hee-hee!\"\\nPurnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\\n\\n\\n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,\\n where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons\\n he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\\n three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\\n curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\\n behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\\n\\n\\n \"Is it possible that we\\'re all crazy, Captain?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s possible, but we\\'re not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I still can\\'t believe it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll never be the same.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back\\n there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us\\n suddenly—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But didn\\'t you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, him. I\\'m afraid not, Captain. I—I guess I was thinking mostly of\\n myself.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him\\n too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t follow you, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got\\n him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil\\n come back to his tormentors—back to us—when we were trapped under\\n those logs?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn\\'t do\\n him any more harm.... I\\'m sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I\\'m\\n still a little shaky.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.\\n I\\'ll join you in a few minutes. I think I\\'ll go back and look around.\\n You know. Make sure we haven\\'t left anyone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No need to do that. They\\'re all ahead of us. I\\'ve checked.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\"\\nAs Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through\\n glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was\\n nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\\n had become familiar.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n\\n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\\n beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\\n returned.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve made a terrible mistake. We—\" The sounds faded in and out on\\n Purnie\\'s ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\\n directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\\n logs and peer around and under them.\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'re hurt I\\'d like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\\n now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\\n shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\\n the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\\n the others.\\n\\n\\n Purnie\\'s eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\\n beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\\n white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\\n ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

On the office wall behind him\\n were three or four framed documents in Latin that were supposed to be\\n signs of great learning, but I didn\\'t care at that moment if he papered\\n the walls with his degrees. I had been appointed dean and president\\n to see to it that the university made money. I had a job to do, and I\\n meant to do it.\\n\\n\\n He bit off each word with great restraint: \"Sociology is the study of\\n social institutions, Mr. Halloway.\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to make him understand my position. \"Look, it\\'s the big-money\\n men who are supposed to be contributing to the support of this college.\\n To them, sociology sounds like socialism—nothing can sound worse than\\n that—and an institution is where they put Aunt Maggy when she began\\n collecting Wheaties in a stamp album. We can\\'t appeal to them that way.\\n Come on now.\" I smiled condescendingly, knowing it would irritate him.\\n \"What are you doing that\\'s worth anything?\"\\n\\n\\n He glared at me, his white hair bristling and his nostrils dilated\\n like a war horse about to whinny. I can say one thing for them—these\\n scientists and professors always keep themselves well under control.\\n He had a book in his hand and I was expecting him to throw it, but he\\n spoke instead:\\n\\n\\n \"This department\\'s analysis of institutional accretion, by the use of\\n open system mathematics, has been recognized as an outstanding and\\n valuable contribution to—\"\\n\\n\\n The words were impressive, whatever they meant, but this still didn\\'t\\n sound like anything that would pull in money. I interrupted, \"Valuable\\n in what way?\"\\n\\n\\n He sat down on the edge of his desk thoughtfully, apparently recovering\\n from the shock of being asked to produce something solid for his\\n position, and ran his eyes over the titles of the books that lined his\\n office walls.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sociology has been valuable to business in initiating worker\\n efficiency and group motivation studies, which they now use in\\n management decisions. And, of course, since the depression, Washington\\n has been using sociological studies of employment, labor and standards\\n of living as a basis for its general policies of—\"\\n\\n\\n I stopped him with both raised hands. \"Please, Professor Caswell! That\\n would hardly be a recommendation. Washington, the New Deal and the\\n present Administration are somewhat touchy subjects to the men I have\\n to deal with. They consider its value debatable, if you know what I\\n mean. If they got the idea that sociology professors are giving advice\\n and guidance—No, we have to stick to brass tacks and leave Washington\\n out of this. What, specifically, has the work of this specific\\n department done that would make it as worthy to receive money as—say,\\n a heart disease research fund?\"\\n\\n\\n He began to tap the corner of his book absently on the desk, watching\\n me. \"Fundamental research doesn\\'t show immediate effects, Mr. Halloway,\\n but its value is recognized.\"\\n\\n\\n I smiled and took out my pipe. \"All right, tell me about it. Maybe I\\'ll\\n recognize its value.\"\\n\\n\\n Prof. Caswell smiled back tightly. He knew his department was at stake.\\n The other departments were popular with donors and pulled in gift\\n money by scholarships and fellowships, and supported their professors\\n and graduate students by research contracts with the government\\n and industry. Caswell had to show a way to make his own department\\n popular—or else. I couldn\\'t fire him directly, of course, but there\\n are ways of doing it indirectly.\\nHe laid down his book and ran a hand over his ruffled hair.\\n \"Institutions—organizations, that is—\" his voice became more\\n resonant; like most professors, when he had to explain something he\\n instinctively slipped into his platform lecture mannerisms, and began\\n to deliver an essay—\"have certain tendencies built into the way they\\n happen to have been organized, which cause them to expand or contract\\n without reference to the needs they were founded to serve.\"\\n\\n\\n He was becoming flushed with the pleasure of explaining his subject.\\n \"All through the ages, it has been a matter of wonder and dismay\\n to men that a simple organization—such as a church to worship in,\\n or a delegation of weapons to a warrior class merely for defense\\n against an outside enemy—will either grow insensately and extend its\\n control until it is a tyranny over their whole lives, or, like other\\n organizations set up to serve a vital need, will tend to repeatedly\\n dwindle and vanish, and have to be painfully rebuilt.\\n\\n\\n \"The reason can be traced to little quirks in the way they were\\n organized, a matter of positive and negative power feedbacks. Such\\n simple questions as, \\'Is there a way a holder of authority in this\\n organization can use the power available to him to increase his power?\\'\\n provide the key. But it still could not be handled until the complex\\n questions of interacting motives and long-range accumulations of minor\\n effects could somehow be simplified and formulated. In working on the\\n problem, I found that the mathematics of open system, as introduced\\n to biology by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and George Kreezer, could be\\n used as a base that would enable me to develop a specifically social\\n mathematics, expressing the human factors of intermeshing authority and\\n motives in simple formulas.\\n\\n\\n \"By these formulations, it is possible to determine automatically the\\n amount of growth and period of life of any organization. The UN, to\\n choose an unfortunate example, is a shrinker type organization. Its\\n monetary support is not in the hands of those who personally benefit\\n by its governmental activities, but, instead, in the hands of those\\n who would personally lose by any extension and encroachment of its\\n authority on their own. Yet by the use of formula analysis—\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s theory,\" I said. \"How about proof?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My equations are already being used in the study of limited-size\\n Federal corporations. Washington—\"\\n\\n\\n I held up my palm again. \"Please, not that nasty word again. I mean,\\n where else has it been put into operation? Just a simple demonstration,\\n something to show that it works, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked away from me thoughtfully, picked up the book and began to\\n tap it on the desk again. It had some unreadable title and his name on\\n it in gold letters. I got the distinct impression again that he was\\n repressing an urge to hit me with it.\\n\\n\\n He spoke quietly. \"All right, I\\'ll give you a demonstration. Are you\\n willing to wait six months?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly, if you can show me something at the end of that time.\"\\n\\n\\n Reminded of time, I glanced at my watch and stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"Could we discuss this over lunch?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t mind hearing more, but I\\'m having lunch with some\\n executors of a millionaire\\'s will. They have to be convinced that by,\\n \\'furtherance of research into human ills,\\' he meant that the money\\n should go to research fellowships for postgraduate biologists at the\\n university, rather than to a medical foundation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see you have your problems, too,\" Caswell said, conceding me\\n nothing. He extended his hand with a chilly smile. \"Well, good\\n afternoon, Mr. Halloway. I\\'m glad we had this talk.\"\\n\\n\\n I shook hands and left him standing there, sure of his place in the\\n progress of science and the respect of his colleagues, yet seething\\n inside because I, the president and dean, had boorishly demanded that\\n he produce something tangible.\\n\\n\\n I frankly didn\\'t give a hoot if he blew his lid. My job isn\\'t easy.\\n For a crumb of favorable publicity and respect in the newspapers and\\n an annual ceremony in a silly costume, I spend the rest of the year\\n going hat in hand, asking politely for money at everyone\\'s door,\\n like a well-dressed panhandler, and trying to manage the university\\n on the dribble I get. As far as I was concerned, a department had to\\n support itself or be cut down to what student tuition pays for, which\\n is a handful of over-crowded courses taught by an assistant lecturer.\\n Caswell had to make it work or get out.\\n\\n\\n But the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to hear what he was\\n going to do for a demonstration.\\nAt lunch, three days later, while we were waiting for our order, he\\n opened a small notebook. \"Ever hear of feedback effects?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not enough to have it clear.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know the snowball effect, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, start a snowball rolling downhill and it grows.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now—\" He wrote a short line of symbols on a blank page and\\n turned the notebook around for me to inspect it. \"Here\\'s the formula\\n for the snowball process. It\\'s the basic general growth formula—covers\\n everything.\"\\n\\n\\n It was a row of little symbols arranged like an algebra equation. One\\n was a concentric spiral going up, like a cross-section of a snowball\\n rolling in snow. That was a growth sign.\\n\\n\\n I hadn\\'t expected to understand the equation, but it was almost as\\n clear as a sentence. I was impressed and slightly intimidated by it.\\n He had already explained enough so that I knew that, if he was right,\\n here was the growth of the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, the\\n conquests of Alexander and the spread of the smoking habit and the\\n change and rigidity of the unwritten law of styles.\\n\\n\\n \"Is it really as simple as that?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"You notice,\" he said, \"that when it becomes too heavy for the cohesion\\n strength of snow, it breaks apart. Now in human terms—\"\\n\\n\\n The chops and mashed potatoes and peas arrived.\\n\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I urged.\\n\\n\\n He was deep in the symbology of human motives and the equations of\\n human behavior in groups. After running through a few different\\n types of grower and shrinker type organizations, we came back to the\\n snowball, and decided to run the test by making something grow.\\n\\n\\n \"You add the motives,\" he said, \"and the equation will translate them\\n into organization.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a good selfish reason for the ins to drag others into the\\n group—some sort of bounty on new members, a cut of their membership\\n fee?\" I suggested uncertainly, feeling slightly foolish. \"And maybe a\\n reason why the members would lose if any of them resigned, and some\\n indirect way they could use to force each other to stay in.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The first is the chain letter principle,\" he nodded. \"I\\'ve got\\n that. The other....\" He put the symbols through some mathematical\\n manipulation so that a special grouping appeared in the middle of the\\n equation. \"That\\'s it.\"\\n\\n\\n Since I seemed to have the right idea, I suggested some more, and he\\n added some, and juggled them around in different patterns. We threw\\n out a few that would have made the organization too complicated, and\\n finally worked out an idyllically simple and deadly little organization\\n setup where joining had all the temptation of buying a sweepstakes\\n ticket, going in deeper was as easy as hanging around a race track, and\\n getting out was like trying to pull free from a Malayan thumb trap. We\\n put our heads closer together and talked lower, picking the best place\\n for the demonstration.\\n\\n\\n \"Abington?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about Watashaw? I have some student sociological surveys of it\\n already. We can pick a suitable group from that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This demonstration has got to be convincing. We\\'d better pick a little\\n group that no one in his right mind would expect to grow.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There should be a suitable club—\"\\n\\n\\n Picture Professor Caswell, head of the Department of Sociology, and\\n with him the President of the University, leaning across the table\\n toward each other, sipping coffee and talking in conspiratorial tones\\n over something they were writing in a notebook.\\n\\n\\n That was us.\\n\"Ladies,\" said the skinny female chairman of the Watashaw Sewing\\n Circle. \"Today we have guests.\" She signaled for us to rise, and we\\n stood up, bowing to polite applause and smiles. \"Professor Caswell, and\\n Professor Smith.\" \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mMy alias.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m \"They are making a survey of the methods\\n and duties of the clubs of Watashaw.\"\\n\\n\\n We sat down to another ripple of applause and slightly wider smiles,\\n and then the meeting of the Watashaw Sewing Circle began. In five\\n minutes I began to feel sleepy.\\n\\n\\n There were only about thirty people there, and it was a small room, not\\n the halls of Congress, but they discussed their business of collecting\\n and repairing second hand clothing for charity with the same endless\\n boring parliamentary formality.\\n\\n\\n I pointed out to Caswell the member I thought would be the natural\\n leader, a tall, well-built woman in a green suit, with conscious\\n gestures and a resonant, penetrating voice, and then went into a\\n half doze while Caswell stayed awake beside me and wrote in his\\n notebook. After a while the resonant voice roused me to attention for\\n a moment. It was the tall woman holding the floor over some collective\\n dereliction of the club. She was being scathing.\\n\\n\\n I nudged Caswell and murmured, \"Did you fix it so that a shover has a\\n better chance of getting into office than a non-shover?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think there\\'s a way they could find for it,\" Caswell whispered back,\\n and went to work on his equation again. \"Yes, several ways to bias the\\n elections.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good. Point them out tactfully to the one you select. Not as if\\n she\\'d use such methods, but just as an example of the reason why only\\nshe\\ncan be trusted with initiating the change. Just mention all the\\n personal advantages an unscrupulous person could have.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded, keeping a straight and sober face as if we were exchanging\\n admiring remarks about the techniques of clothes repairing, instead of\\n conspiring.\\n\\n\\n After the meeting, Caswell drew the tall woman in the green suit\\n aside and spoke to her confidentially, showing her the diagram of\\n organization we had drawn up. I saw the responsive glitter in the\\n woman\\'s eyes and knew she was hooked.\\n\\n\\n We left the diagram of organization and our typed copy of the new\\n bylaws with her and went off soberly, as befitted two social science\\n experimenters. We didn\\'t start laughing until our car passed the town\\n limits and began the climb for University Heights.\\n\\n\\n If Caswell\\'s equations meant anything at all, we had given that sewing\\n circle more growth drives than the Roman Empire.\\nFour months later I had time out from a very busy schedule to wonder\\n how the test was coming along. Passing Caswell\\'s office, I put my head\\n in. He looked up from a student research paper he was correcting.\\n\\n\\n \"Caswell, about that sewing club business—I\\'m beginning to feel the\\n suspense. Could I get an advance report on how it\\'s coming?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not following it. We\\'re supposed to let it run the full six\\n months.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I\\'m curious. Could I get in touch with that woman—what\\'s her\\n name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Searles. Mrs. George Searles.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Would that change the results?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not in the slightest. If you want to graph the membership rise, it\\n should be going up in a log curve, probably doubling every so often.\"\\n\\n\\n I grinned. \"If it\\'s not rising, you\\'re fired.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned back. \"If it\\'s not rising, you won\\'t have to fire me—I\\'ll\\n burn my books and shoot myself.\"\\n\\n\\n I returned to my office and put in a call to Watashaw.\\n\\n\\n While I was waiting for the phone to be answered, I took a piece of\\n graph paper and ruled it off into six sections, one for each month.\\n After the phone had rung in the distance for a long time, a servant\\n answered with a bored drawl:\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Searles\\' residence.\"\\n\\n\\n I picked up a red gummed star and licked it.\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Searles, please.\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s not in just now. Could I take a message?\"\\n\\n\\n I placed the star at the thirty line in the beginning of the first\\n section. Thirty members they\\'d started with.\\n\\n\\n \"No, thanks. Could you tell me when she\\'ll be back?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not until dinner. She\\'s at the meetin\\'.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The sewing club?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir, not that thing. There isn\\'t any Sewing club any more, not\\n for a long time. She\\'s at the Civic Welfare meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n Somehow I hadn\\'t expected anything like that.\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said and hung up, and after a moment noticed I was\\n holding a box of red gummed stars in my hand. I closed it and put it\\n down on top of the graph of membership in the sewing circle. No more\\n members....\\n\\n\\n Poor Caswell. The bet between us was ironclad. He wouldn\\'t let me\\n back down on it even if I wanted to. He\\'d probably quit before I put\\n through the first slow move to fire him. His professional pride would\\n be shattered, sunk without a trace. I remembered what he said about\\n shooting himself. It had seemed funny to both of us at the time,\\n but.... What a mess\\nthat\\nwould make for the university.\\n\\n\\n I had to talk to Mrs. Searles. Perhaps there was some outside reason\\n why the club had disbanded. Perhaps it had not just died.\\n\\n\\n I called back. \"This is Professor Smith,\" I said, giving the alias I\\n had used before. \"I called a few minutes ago. When did you say Mrs.\\n Searles will return?\"\\n\\n\\n \"About six-thirty or seven o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\\n Five hours to wait.\\n\\n\\n And what if Caswell asked me what I had found out in the meantime? I\\n didn\\'t want to tell him anything until I had talked it over with that\\n woman Searles first.\\n\\n\\n \"Where is this Civic Welfare meeting?\"\\n\\n\\n She told me.\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, I was in my car, heading for Watashaw, driving\\n considerably faster than my usual speed and keeping a careful watch for\\n highway patrol cars as the speedometer climbed.\\nThe town meeting hall and theater was a big place, probably with lots\\n of small rooms for different clubs. I went in through the center door\\n and found myself in the huge central hall where some sort of rally was\\n being held. A political-type rally—you know, cheers and chants, with\\n bunting already down on the floor, people holding banners, and plenty\\n of enthusiasm and excitement in the air. Someone was making a speech up\\n on the platform. Most of the people there were women.\\n\\n\\n I wondered how the Civic Welfare League could dare hold its meeting at\\n the same time as a political rally that could pull its members away.\\n The group with Mrs. Searles was probably holding a shrunken and almost\\n memberless meeting somewhere in an upper room.\\n\\n\\n There probably was a side door that would lead upstairs.\\n\\n\\n While I glanced around, a pretty girl usher put a printed bulletin in\\n my hand, whispering, \"Here\\'s one of the new copies.\" As I attempted to\\n hand it back, she retreated. \"Oh, you can keep it. It\\'s the new one.\\n Everyone\\'s supposed to have it. We\\'ve just printed up six thousand\\n copies to make sure there\\'ll be enough to last.\"\\n\\n\\n The tall woman on the platform had been making a driving, forceful\\n speech about some plans for rebuilding Watashaw\\'s slum section. It\\n began to penetrate my mind dimly as I glanced down at the bulletin in\\n my hands.\\n\\n\\n \"Civic Welfare League of Watashaw. The United Organization of Church\\n and Secular Charities.\" That\\'s what it said. Below began the rules of\\n membership.\\n\\n\\n I looked up. The speaker, with a clear, determined voice and conscious,\\n forceful gestures, had entered the homestretch of her speech, an appeal\\n to the civic pride of all citizens of Watashaw.\\n\\n\\n \"With a bright and glorious future—potentially without poor and\\n without uncared-for ill—potentially with no ugliness, no vistas which\\n are not beautiful—the best people in the best planned town in the\\n country—the jewel of the United States.\"\\n\\n\\n She paused and then leaned forward intensely, striking her clenched\\n hand on the speaker\\'s stand with each word for emphasis.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAll we need is more members. Now get out there and recruit!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n I finally recognized Mrs. Searles, as an answering sudden blast of\\n sound half deafened me. The crowd was chanting at the top of its lungs:\\n \"Recruit! Recruit!\"\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Searles stood still at the speaker\\'s table and behind her,\\n seated in a row of chairs, was a group that was probably the board of\\n directors. It was mostly women, and the women began to look vaguely\\n familiar, as if they could be members of the sewing circle.\\n\\n\\n I put my lips close to the ear of the pretty usher while I turned over\\n the stiff printed bulletin on a hunch. \"How long has the League been\\n organized?\" On the back of the bulletin was a constitution.\\n\\n\\n She was cheering with the crowd, her eyes sparkling. \"I don\\'t know,\"\\n she answered between cheers. \"I only joined two days ago. Isn\\'t it\\n wonderful?\"\\n\\n\\n I went into the quiet outer air and got into my car with my skin\\n prickling. Even as I drove away, I could hear them. They were singing\\n some kind of organization song with the tune of \"Marching through\\n Georgia.\"\\n\\n\\n Even at the single glance I had given it, the constitution looked\\n exactly like the one we had given the Watashaw Sewing Circle.\\n\\n\\n All I told Caswell when I got back was that the sewing circle had\\n changed its name and the membership seemed to be rising.\\nNext day, after calling Mrs. Searles, I placed some red stars on my\\n graph for the first three months. They made a nice curve, rising more\\n steeply as it reached the fourth month. They had picked up their first\\n increase in membership simply by amalgamating with all the other types\\n of charity organizations in Watashaw, changing the club name with each\\n fusion, but keeping the same constitution—the constitution with the\\n bright promise of advantages as long as there were always new members\\n being brought in.\\n\\n\\n By the fifth month, the League had added a mutual baby-sitting service\\n and had induced the local school board to add a nursery school to the\\n town service, so as to free more women for League activity. But charity\\n must have been completely organized by then, and expansion had to be in\\n other directions.\\n\\n\\n Some real estate agents evidently had been drawn into the whirlpool\\n early, along with their ideas. The slum improvement plans began to\\n blossom and take on a tinge of real estate planning later in the month.\\n\\n\\n The first day of the sixth month, a big two page spread appeared in\\n the local paper of a mass meeting which had approved a full-fledged\\n scheme for slum clearance of Watashaw\\'s shack-town section, plus plans\\n for rehousing, civic building, and rezoning.\\nAnd\\ngood prospects\\n for attracting some new industries to the town, industries which had\\n already been contacted and seemed interested by the privileges offered.\\n\\n\\n And with all this, an arrangement for securing and distributing to the\\n club members\\nalone\\nmost of the profit that would come to the town in\\n the form of a rise in the price of building sites and a boom in the\\n building industry. The profit distributing arrangement was the same one\\n that had been built into the organization plan for the distribution\\n of the small profits of membership fees and honorary promotions. It\\n was becoming an openly profitable business. Membership was rising more\\n rapidly now.\\n\\n\\n By the second week of the sixth month, news appeared in the local paper\\n that the club had filed an application to incorporate itself as the\\n Watashaw Mutual Trade and Civic Development Corporation, and all the\\n local real estate promoters had finished joining en masse. The Mutual\\n Trade part sounded to me as if the Chamber of Commerce was on the point\\n of being pulled in with them, ideas, ambitions and all.\\n\\n\\n I chuckled while reading the next page of the paper, on which a local\\n politician was reported as having addressed the club with a long\\n flowery oration on their enterprise, charity, and civic spirit. He\\n had been made an honorary member. If he allowed himself to be made a\\nfull\\nmember with its contractual obligations and its lures, if the\\n politicians went into this, too....\\n\\n\\n I laughed, filing the newspaper with the other documents on the\\n Watashaw test. These proofs would fascinate any businessman with the\\n sense to see where his bread was buttered. A businessman is constantly\\n dealing with organizations, including his own, and finding them either\\n inert, cantankerous, or both. Caswell\\'s formula could be a handle to\\n grasp them with. Gratitude alone would bring money into the university\\n in carload lots.\\nThe end of the sixth month came. The test was over and the end reports\\n were spectacular. Caswell\\'s formulas were proven to the hilt.\\n\\n\\n After reading the last newspaper reports, I called him up.\\n\\n\\n \"Perfect, Wilt,\\nperfect\\n! I can use this Watashaw thing to get you so\\n many fellowships and scholarships and grants for your department that\\n you\\'ll think it\\'s snowing money!\"\\n\\n\\n He answered somewhat disinterestedly, \"I\\'ve been busy working with\\n students on their research papers and marking tests—not following the\\n Watashaw business at all, I\\'m afraid. You say the demonstration went\\n well and you\\'re satisfied?\"\\n\\n\\n He was definitely putting on a chill. We were friends now, but\\n obviously he was still peeved whenever he was reminded that I had\\n doubted that his theory could work. And he was using its success to\\n rub my nose in the realization that I had been wrong. A man with a\\n string of degrees after his name is just as human as anyone else. I had\\n needled him pretty hard that first time.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m satisfied,\" I acknowledged. \"I was wrong. The formulas work\\n beautifully. Come over and see my file of documents on it if you want a\\n boost for your ego. Now let\\'s see the formula for stopping it.\"\\n\\n\\n He sounded cheerful again. \"I didn\\'t complicate that organization\\n with negatives. I wanted it to\\ngrow\\n. It falls apart naturally when\\n it stops growing for more than two months. It\\'s like the great stock\\n boom before an economic crash. Everyone in it is prosperous as long as\\n the prices just keep going up and new buyers come into the market, but\\n they all knew what would happen if it stopped growing. You remember, we\\n built in as one of the incentives that the members know they are going\\n to lose if membership stops growing. Why, if I tried to stop it now,\\n they\\'d cut my throat.\"\\n\\n\\n I remembered the drive and frenzy of the crowd in the one early meeting\\n I had seen. They probably would.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" he continued. \"We\\'ll just let it play out to the end of its\\n tether and die of old age.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When will that be?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can\\'t grow past the female population of the town. There are only\\n so many women in Watashaw, and some of them don\\'t like sewing.\"\\n\\n\\n The graph on the desk before me began to look sinister. Surely Caswell\\n must have made some provision for—\\n\\n\\n \"You underestimate their ingenuity,\" I said into the phone. \"Since they\\n wanted to expand, they didn\\'t stick to sewing. They went from general\\n charity to social welfare schemes to something that\\'s pretty close to\\n an incorporated government. The name is now the Watashaw Mutual Trade\\n and Civic Development Corporation, and they\\'re filing an application\\n to change it to Civic Property Pool and Social Dividend, membership\\n contractual, open to all. That social dividend sounds like a Technocrat\\n climbed on the band wagon, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n While I spoke, I carefully added another red star to the curve above\\n the thousand member level, checking with the newspaper that still lay\\n open on my desk. The curve was definitely some sort of log curve now,\\n growing more rapidly with each increase.\\n\\n\\n \"Leaving out practical limitations for a moment, where does the formula\\n say it will stop?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"When you run out of people to join it. But after all, there are only\\n so many people in Watashaw. It\\'s a pretty small town.\"\\n\"They\\'ve opened a branch office in New York,\" I said carefully into the\\n phone, a few weeks later.\\n\\n\\n With my pencil, very carefully, I extended the membership curve from\\n where it was then.\\n\\n\\n After the next doubling, the curve went almost straight up and off the\\n page.\\n\\n\\n Allowing for a lag of contagion from one nation to another, depending\\n on how much their citizens intermingled, I\\'d give the rest of the world\\n about twelve years.\\n\\n\\n There was a long silence while Caswell probably drew the same graph\\n in his own mind. Then he laughed weakly. \"Well, you asked me for a\\n demonstration.\"\\n\\n\\n That was as good an answer as any. We got together and had lunch in a\\n bar, if you can call it lunch. The movement we started will expand by\\n hook or by crook, by seduction or by bribery or by propaganda or by\\n conquest, but it will expand. And maybe a total world government will\\n be a fine thing—until it hits the end of its rope in twelve years or\\n so.\\n\\n\\n What happens then, I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\n But I don\\'t want anyone to pin that on me. From now on, if anyone asks\\n me, I\\'ve never heard of Watashaw.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

He could not quite explain the\\n feelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since\\n the engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,\\n from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his\\n life, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had\\n grown.\\n\\n\\n If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This\\n disturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had\\n realized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Today, space looked somehow different. The stars—it was a meaningless\\n concept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright\\n pinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport—were not\\n apparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,\\n there was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart\\n by itself in the middle of the viewport.\\n\\n\\n If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was\\n odd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was—it was—what\\n was it?\\n\\n\\n Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and\\n greeted gray-haired old Chuls.\\n\\n\\n \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you\\'ll be ready to sire\\n children. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the\\n health-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn\\'t feel like it;\\n he just didn\\'t, without comprehending.\\n\\n\\n Chuls\\' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the\\n time he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select\\n as his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud\\n ignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling\\n he could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man\\n had? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always\\n embroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a\\n headache?\\n\\n\\n Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here\\n and knew it was your time, too....\"\\n\\n\\n His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not\\n explain had entered the elder man\\'s head for a moment, but it had\\n departed almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll go with you,\" Rikud told him.\\nA hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the\\n health-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray\\n tubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant\\n tube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch\\n the one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing\\n larger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a\\n metallic voice said. \"Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy\\n him. Now why shouldn\\'t a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when\\n he wanted to do it?\\nThere\\nwas a strange thought, and Rikud\\'s brain\\n whirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and\\n unsatisfactory answers.\\n\\n\\n He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got\\n hurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl\\n himself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen.\\n But something soft had cushioned the impact—something which had come\\n into being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being\\n again, something which was as impalpable as air.\\n\\n\\n Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real\\n authority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that\\n there should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine\\n in the library had told him of the elders—a meaningless term—who had\\n governed the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but\\n that was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only\\n listened to the buzzer.\\n\\n\\n And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said.\\n There had been a revolt—again a term without any real meaning, a term\\n that could have no reality outside of the reading machine—and the\\n elders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people\\n had decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and\\n that it was unfair that the elders alone had this authority. They were\\n born and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little\\n cogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but\\n he knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the\\n people against the elders, and it said the people had won.\\n\\n\\n Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he\\n had to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the\\n look of easy contentment on Chuls\\' face as the rays fanned down upon\\n him, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations\\n before Rikud\\'s time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of\\n medicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old\\n age, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud\\n often thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future,\\n not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only\\n a decade to go.\\n\\n\\n Under the tube at Rikud\\'s left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy\\n through the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time\\n Rikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True,\\n this was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it\\n proved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw\\n Crifer limp.\\n\\n\\n But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer.\\nNow Crifer said, \"I\\'ve been reading again, Rikud.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes?\" Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the\\n smell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it\\n meant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the\\n library and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat\\n about and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.\\n\\n\\n But if he wasn\\'t reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the\\n people ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it\\n was always the same.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They\\'re also\\n called astronomy, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one\\n elbow. \"What did you find out?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s about all. They\\'re just called astronomy, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, where\\'s the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under\\n \\'astronomy,\\' with a cross-reference under \\'stars.\\' They\\'re synonymous\\n terms.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are\\n changing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he\\n questioned what it might mean in this particular case.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the\\n others.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud\\n knew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he\\n did.\\n\\n\\n Over on Rikud\\'s right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told\\n them, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can\\'t be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, it\\'s wrong. Variability and change are two words without\\n meaning.\"\\n\\n\\n \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested.\\n\\n\\n A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and\\n Chuls said, \"It\\'s almost time for me to eat.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn\\'t even seen the connection between the two\\n concepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,\\n but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.\\n\\n\\n His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange\\n feeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the\\n viewport. When he passed the door which led to the women\\'s half of the\\n world, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.\\n He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly\\n remembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;\\n this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings—strange\\n channelings of Rikud\\'s energy in new and confusing directions.\\n\\n\\n He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the\\n stars again.\\nThe view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud\\'s pulses\\n leap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and\\n where Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of\\n light, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his\\n eyes to look.\\n\\n\\n Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to\\n turn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed\\n to control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white\\n globe—if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There\\n was that word change again. Didn\\'t it have something to do with age?\\n Rikud couldn\\'t remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer\\'s\\n book on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was\\n variable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.\\n\\n\\n Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer,\\n and he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that\\n he couldn\\'t at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his\\n eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them.\\n But the new view persisted.\\n\\n\\n Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone,\\n too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge\\n that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and\\n round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud\\n had no name.\\n\\n\\n A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section\\n of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the\\n viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the\\n middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green,\\n and on the other, blue.\\n\\n\\n Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world\\n had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular\\n intervals by a sharp booming.\\n\\n\\n Change—\\n\\n\\n \"Won\\'t you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I\\'ll eat. Later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s time....\" Chuls\\' voice trailed off again, impotently.\\n\\n\\n But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him,\\n and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw—what he had always\\n seen, except that now there was the added factor of change—perhaps did\\n not exist\\nin\\nthe viewport.\\n\\n\\n Maybe it existed\\nthrough\\nthe viewport.\\n\\n\\n That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see\\n nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more\\n confusing than ever.\\n\\n\\n \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.\\n\\n\\n Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of\\n vapor. \"What do you see?\"\\n\\n\\n Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Else? Nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do\\n you hear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of\\n the engines. \"I\\'m hungry, Rikud.\"\\n\\n\\n The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining\\n room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.\\nNow the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a\\n moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world.\\n But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And\\n besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far\\n vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport\\n which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover,\\n did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens\\n did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.\\n\\n\\n Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.\\n\\n\\n The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.\\nFor a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept\\n it as fact. There—through the viewport and in it—was a garden. A\\n garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had\\n never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the\\n world\\'s garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,\\n it was a garden.\\n\\n\\n He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\\n\\n\\n Crifer, on the other hand, wasn\\'t so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\\n he admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\\n\\n\\n Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could\\n not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the\\n viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking—the\\n word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless\\n it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere\\n was the garden and the world had arrived.\\n\\n\\n \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants\\n are different.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then they\\'ve changed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, merely different.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what about the viewport?\\nIt\\nchanged. Where are the stars?\\n Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The stars come out at night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So there is a change from day to night!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they\\n shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Once they shone all the time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"\\nRikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on\\n astronomy. He hadn\\'t been reading too much lately. The voice of the\\n reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not,\\n our whole perspective has changed.\"\\n\\n\\n And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only\\n the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so\\n obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another,\\n it was with a purpose—to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the\\n health-rays. Now if the world had walked from—somewhere, through the\\n vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also\\n was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But\\n if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could\\n they find the nature of that purpose?\\n\\n\\n \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud\\'s revery.\\n\\n\\n Damn the man, all he did was eat!\\n\\n\\n Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because\\n he was hungry.\\n\\n\\n And Rikud, too, was hungry.\\n\\n\\n Differently.\\nHe had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\\n now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\\n machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\\n door.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s in here?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\\n\\n\\n \"I know, but what\\'s beyond it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\\nthrough\\nthe door.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don\\'t think anyone ever opened\\n it. It\\'s only a door.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I will,\" said Rikud.\\n\\n\\n \"You will what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\\n\\n\\n A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\\n There\\'s nothing. It just isn\\'t. It\\'s only a door, Rikud.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No—\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\\n breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\\n and Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\\n end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\\n Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\\n\\n\\n He missed the beginning, but then:\\n—therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\\n door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\\n rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey\\'s end, you may\\n have discarded it for something better—who knows? But if you have\\n not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\\n is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\\n human-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\\n permit it—within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\\n to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\\n permitted through this door—\\nRikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\\n words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\\n than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\\n voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\\n humming, punctuated by a\\nthrob-throb-throb\\nwhich sounded not unlike\\n the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn\\'t\\n blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud\\'s\\n eyes—he blinked and looked again, but it was still there—cogs and\\n gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\\n they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\\n\\n\\n \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there\\'s a good word, but\\n no one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\\n\\n\\n Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\\n exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\\n opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\\n\\n\\n Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\\n viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\\n although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\\n was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\\n thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\\n off in the distance.\\n\\n\\n And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\\n hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\\n viewport. He began to turn the handle.\\n\\n\\n Then he trembled.\\n\\n\\n What would he do out in the garden?\\n\\n\\n He couldn\\'t go alone. He\\'d die of the strangeness. It was a silly\\n thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\\n couldn\\'t fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud\\'s mouth felt\\n dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\\n through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\\n through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\\n\\n\\n By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\\n not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer\\'s side, and\\n sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\\n garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\\n walk and then might find himself in the garden.\\n\\n\\n It was so big.\\nThree or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to\\n talk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all\\n interested, yet the lame-footed man\\'s mind was inadequate to cope with\\n the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable\\n and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that\\n book on astronomy.\\n\\n\\n Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in\\n the world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the\\n women\\'s quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through\\n that. But there are no others.\"\\n\\n\\n Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by\\n the world, there are two other doors!\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.\\n\\n\\n \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than\\n Crifer, but had no lame foot.\\n\\n\\n \"Doing what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble\\n hearing you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\"\\n\\n\\n Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig.\\n \"Why don\\'t we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I won\\'t go,\" Chuls replied. \"There\\'s no reason to go. If Rikud\\n has been imagining things, why should I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I imagined nothing. I\\'ll show you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll show me nothing because I won\\'t go.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud grabbed Chuls\\' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what\\n he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at\\n the blouse.\\n\\n\\n \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly.\\nCrifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud\\'s doing! I don\\'t know what\\n he\\'s doing, but look. He\\'s holding Chuls\\' blouse.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening.\\n\\n\\n \"Only if you\\'ll go with me.\" Rikud was panting.\\n\\n\\n Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of\\n them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud\\n holding Chuls\\' blouse.\\n\\n\\n \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer\\'s\\n shirt.\\n\\n\\n Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each\\n partner grabbing for his companion\\'s blouse. They giggled and laughed\\n and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.\\n\\n\\n A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.\\n\\n\\n Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\"\\n\\n\\n In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his\\n throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What\\n would have happened if they hadn\\'t retired? But they always did things\\n punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the\\n buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.\\n\\n\\n What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?\\n\\n\\n This frightened Rikud, although he didn\\'t know why. He\\'d like it,\\n though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big\\n garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn\\'t be afraid because he\\n could huddle close to them and he wouldn\\'t be alone.\\nRikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the\\n machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears\\n spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he\\n began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears,\\n would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he\\n was clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again\\n upon entering the room.\\n\\n\\n He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as\\n wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that\\n held it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he\\n swung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding,\\n crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled\\n under his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.\\nAlmost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not\\n casual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud\\n smashed everything in sight.\\n\\n\\n When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room\\n was a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first,\\n but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in\\n his ears because now the throbbing had stopped.\\n\\n\\n He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller\\n viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain\\n beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone\\n clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.\\n\\n\\n Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that\\n door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once,\\n when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the\\n darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.\\n\\n\\n Whimpering, he fled.\\nAll around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did\\n not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to\\n eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the\\n whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the\\n smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run\\n any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.\\n\\n\\n Chuls said, over and over, \"I\\'m hungry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied\\n confidently.\\n\\n\\n \"It won\\'t any more,\" Rikud said.\\n\\n\\n \"What won\\'t?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"\\n\\n\\n Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn\\'t have done it. That was a bad\\n thing you did, Rikud.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the\\n stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there\\n beyond the viewport.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s ridiculous,\" Chuls said.\\n\\n\\n Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can\\n eat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I\\n hate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.\\n\\n\\n Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with\\n him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have\\n had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women\\'s\\n quarters. Did women eat?\\n\\n\\n Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a\\n frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the\\n plants in the viewport would even be better.\\n\\n\\n \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.\\n\\n\\n Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you,\\n too, to show you how it is to be broken.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We must go outside—through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd\\n gurgling sound his stomach made.\\n\\n\\n A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard\\n Crifer\\'s voice. \"I have Rikud\\'s head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.\\n\\n\\n Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had\\n broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer\\n to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.\\n\\n\\n The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.\\n \"I hit him! I hit him!\"\\n\\n\\n Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone\\n was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and\\n he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us\\n do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the\\n darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too\\n weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing\\n hurt in his stomach. But it didn\\'t matter. He heard the angry voices\\n and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.\\n\\n\\n It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run\\n was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and\\n how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him\\n were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely\\n and positively.\\n\\n\\n He became sickly giddy thinking about it.\\n\\n\\n But if he didn\\'t open the door and go into the garden outside, he would\\n die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and\\n grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.\\n\\n\\n He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library,\\n through the inner door and into the room with the voice—but the\\n voice didn\\'t speak this time—through its door and into the place of\\n machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and\\n he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard\\n Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.\\n\\n\\n Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor.\\n He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it\\n with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.\\n\\n\\n He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were\\n closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness,\\n it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those\\n behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not\\n far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to\\n break him.\\n\\n\\n Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life.\\n The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of\\n low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If\\n plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could\\n people. Rikud and his people\\nshould\\n. This was why the world had moved\\n across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud\\'s lifetime and more.\\n But he was afraid.\\n\\n\\n He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his\\n fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head.\\n Slowly he slipped to the cool floor—how his head was burning!—and for\\n a long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he\\n heard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on\\n the metal of the passage. He heard Crifer\\'s voice louder than the rest:\\n \"There is Rikud on the floor!\"\\n\\n\\n Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright.\\n Something small and brown scurried across the other side of the\\n viewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous\\n red eyes.\\n\\n\\n Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face\\n was so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that\\n everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the\\n machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal\\n which he could see in the dim light through the open door.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s the buzzer?\" he sobbed. \"I must find the buzzer.\"\\n\\n\\n Crifer\\'s voice, from the darkness inside, said, \"You broke it. You\\n broke it. And now we will break you—\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped\\n down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps\\n came, and soon he saw Crifer\\'s head peer in through the passageway.\\n Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him.\\n\\n\\n His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it\\n be variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying\\n brown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his\\n stomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing\\n could live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness,\\n then so could he live out there, and Crifer and all the others....\\n\\n\\n So tightly did he grip the handle that his fingers began to hurt. And\\n his heart pounded hard and he felt the pulses leaping on either side of\\n his neck.\\n\\n\\n He stared out into the garden, and off into the distance, where the\\n blue-white globe which might have been a star stood just above the row\\n of mounds.\\nCrifer was tugging at him, trying to pull him away from the door, and\\n someone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make him fall. He kicked\\n out and the hands let go, and then he turned the handle and shoved the\\n weight of his body with all his strength against the door.\\n\\n\\n It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth.\\n\\n\\n The air was fresh, fresher than any air Rikud had ever breathed. He\\n walked around aimlessly, touching the plants and bending down to feel\\n the floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the\\n horizon. It was all very beautiful.\\n\\n\\n Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across\\n the land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when\\n he got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the\\n others followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the\\n water to drink.\\nRikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was\\n good.\\n\\n\\n Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. \"Even feelings\\n are variable. I don\\'t hate you now, Rikud.\"\\n\\n\\n Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. \"People are variable, too, Crifer.\\n That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re women,\" said Crifer.\\n\\n\\n They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely\\n human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly\\n exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness.\\n With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.\\n\\n\\n It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer,\\n frightening doors and women by appointment only.\\n\\n\\n Rikud felt at home.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

LUDWIG\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by EMSH\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Science Fiction May 1956.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nWith never a moment to rest, the pursuit\\n \\nthrough space felt like a game of hounds\\n \\nand hares ... or was it follow the leader?\\nBen Curtis eased his pale, gaunt body through the open doorway of the\\n Blast Inn, the dead man following silently behind him.\\n\\n\\n His fear-borne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian gin\\n mill. The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\\n ingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\\n\\n\\n Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\\n smoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil\\'s Egg. Here and\\n there, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\\n Martians or Venusians.\\n\\n\\n Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\\n was the dead man\\'s hand.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nComa esta, senor?\\n\" a small voice piped. \"\\nSpeken die Deutsch?\\n Desirez-vous d\\'amour? Da? Nyet?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Ben looked down.\\n\\n\\n The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like\\n a red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn\\n skivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m American,\" Ben muttered.\\n\\n\\n \"Ah,\\nbuena\\n! I speak English\\ntres\\nfine,\\nsenor\\n. I have Martian\\n friend, she\\ntres\\npretty and\\ntres\\nfat. She weigh almost eighty\\n pounds,\\nmonsieur\\n. I take you to her,\\nsi\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Ben shook his head.\\nHe thought,\\nI don\\'t want your Martian wench. I don\\'t want your opium\\n or your Devil\\'s Egg or your Venusian kali. But if you had a drug that\\'d\\n bring a dead man to life, I\\'d buy and pay with my soul.\\n\"It is deal,\\nmonsieur\\n? Five dollars or twenty\\nkeelis\\nfor visit\\n Martian friend. Maybe you like House of Dreams. For House of Dreams—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not buying.\"\\n\\n\\n The dirty-faced kid shrugged. \"Then I show you to good table,—\\ntres\\n bien\\n. I do not charge you,\\nsenor\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n The boy grabbed his hand. Because Ben could think of no reason for\\n resisting, he followed. They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and\\n through the drone of alcohol-cracked voices.\\nThey passed the bar with its line of lean-featured, slit-eyed\\n Earthmen—merchant spacemen.\\n\\n\\n They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian\\n marble that jutted up into the semi-darkness like fog-blanketed\\n tombstones.\\n\\n\\n Several times, Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CO\\n 2\\n -breathing\\n Venusians, the first he\\'d ever seen.\\n\\n\\n They were smoky gray, scaly, naked giants, toads in human shape.\\n They stood solitary and motionless, aloof, their green-lidded eyes\\n unblinking. They certainly didn\\'t look like telepaths, as Ben had heard\\n they were, but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine.\\n\\n\\n Once he spied a white-uniformed officer of Hoover City\\'s Security\\n Police. The man was striding down an aisle, idly tapping his neuro-club\\n against the stone booths.\\nKeep walking\\n, Ben told himself.\\nYou look the same as anyone else\\n here. Keep walking. Look straight ahead.\\nThe officer passed. Ben breathed easier.\\n\\n\\n \"Here we are,\\nmonsieur\\n,\" piped the Martian boy. \"A\\ntres\\nfine table.\\n Close in the shadows.\"\\n\\n\\n Ben winced. How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows?\\n Frowning, he sat down—he and the dead man.\\n\\n\\n He listened to the lonely rhythms of the four-piece Martian orchestra.\\n\\n\\n The Martians were fragile, doll-like creatures with heads too large for\\n their spindly bodies. Their long fingers played upon the strings of\\n their\\ncirillas\\nor crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider\\n legs. Their tune was sad. Even when they played an Earth tune, it still\\n seemed a song of old Mars, charged with echoes of lost voices and\\n forgotten grandeur.\\n\\n\\n For an instant, Ben\\'s mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead\\n man. He thought,\\nWhat are they doing here, these Martians? Here, in\\n a smoke-filled room under a metalite dome on a dust-covered world?\\n Couldn\\'t they have played their music on Mars? Or had they, like me,\\n felt the challenge of new worlds?\\nHe sobered. It didn\\'t matter. He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese\\n waiter. He wet his lips but did not drink. His gaze wandered over the\\n faces of the Inn\\'s other occupants.\\nYou\\'ve got to find him\\n, he thought.\\nYou\\'ve got to find the man with\\n the red beard. It\\'s the only way you can escape the dead man.\\nThe dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and\\n about forty and he hated spacemen.\\n\\n\\n His body was buried now—probably in the silent gray wastes outside\\n Luna City. But he\\'d become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a\\n part of Ben as sight in his eyes.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips\\n spitting whiskey-slurred curses.\\n\\n\\n Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben\\'s fist\\n thudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the\\n whiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle\\n from a corner of the gaping mouth.\\n\\n\\n You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or\\n ignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can\\'t escape from a\\n memory that has burned into your mind.\\n\\n\\n It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had\\n been successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.\\n He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb\\n plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.\\n\\n\\n \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you\\n see\\'s spacemen.\"\\n\\n\\n He was a neatly dressed civilian.\\n\\n\\n Ben smiled. \"If it weren\\'t for spacemen, you wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The name\\'s Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey\\n suits. They think they\\'re little tin gods. Betcha you think you\\'re a\\n little tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey.\\n\\n\\n Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,\\n crimson-braided uniform of the\\nOdyssey\\'s\\njunior astrogation officer.\\n He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining\\n uniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\\n\\n\\n He\\'d sought long for that key.\\nAt the age of five—perhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents\\'\\n death in a recent strato-jet crash—he\\'d spent hours watching the night\\n sky for streaking flame-tails of Moon rockets. At ten, he\\'d ground\\n his first telescope. At fourteen, he\\'d converted an abandoned shed on\\n the government boarding-school grounds to a retreat which housed his\\n collection of astronomy and rocketry books.\\n\\n\\n At sixteen, he\\'d spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys\\n Town No. 5 in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport. There, among\\n the grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol, he\\'d found friends who\\n understood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the\\n U. S. Academy for the Conquest of Space.\\n\\n\\n And a month ago, he\\'d signed aboard the\\nOdyssey\\n—the first ship, it\\n was rumored, equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps\\n beyond.\\n\\n\\n Cobb was persistent: \"Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth.\\n What the hell good is it, jumpin\\' from planet to planet?\"\\nThe guy\\'s drunk\\n, Ben thought. He took his drink and moved three\\n stools down the bar.\\n\\n\\n Cobb followed. \"You don\\'t like the truth, eh, kid? You don\\'t like\\n people to call you a sucker.\"\\n\\n\\n Ben rose and started to leave the bar, but Cobb grabbed his arm and\\n held him there.\\n\\n\\n \"Thas what you are—a sucker. You\\'re young now. Wait ten years. You\\'ll\\n be dyin\\' of radiation rot or a meteor\\'ll get you. Wait and see, sucker!\"\\n\\n\\n Until this instant, Ben had suppressed his anger. Now, suddenly and\\n without warning, it welled up into savage fury.\\n\\n\\n His fist struck the man on the chin. Cobb\\'s eyes gaped in shocked\\n horror. He spun backward. His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of\\n the bar. The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of\\n life.\\n\\n\\n He sank to the floor, eyes glassy, blood tricking down his jaw.\\n\\n\\n Ben knew that he was dead.\\n\\n\\n Then, for a single absurd second, Ben was seized with terror—just as,\\n a moment before, he\\'d been overwhelmed with anger.\\n\\n\\n He ran.\\nFor some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\\n of dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\\n\\n\\n At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw\\n that he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the\\n city.\\n\\n\\n He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.\\n A thousand stars—a thousand motionless balls of silver fire—shone\\n above him through Luna City\\'s transparent dome.\\n\\n\\n He was sorry he\\'d hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he\\'d run.\\n Escaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\\nYou can do two things\\n, he thought.\\nYou can give yourself up, and that\\'s what a good officer would do.\\n That would eliminate the escape charge. You\\'d get off with voluntary\\n manslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\\n prison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you\\'d be free.\\nBut you\\'d be through with rockets and space. They don\\'t want new\\n men over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\\n jet-men on beat-up freighters—they don\\'t want convicted killers. You\\'d\\n get the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\\n peeking through electric fences of spaceports.\\nOr—\\nThere were old wives\\' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\\n operated from the Solar System\\'s frontiers. The spacemen weren\\'t\\n outlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\\n\\n\\n And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\\n souped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\\n headquarters was Venus. Their leader—a subject of popular and\\n fantastic conjecture in the men\\'s audiozines—was rumored to be a\\n red-bearded giant.\\nSo\\n, Ben reflected,\\nyou can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\\n You can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\\n name. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\\n duty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\\n Earth.\\nAfter all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\\n second, to destroy a man\\'s life and his dream?\\nHe was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\\n flight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\\n personnel even more so.\\n\\n\\n Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\\n\\n\\n There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn\\'t realized that the\\n memory of the dead man\\'s face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\\n as constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\\n\\n\\n But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\\n voice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\\n obscure the dead face?\\n\\n\\n So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\\n and hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\\n\\n\\n \"You look for someone,\\nsenor\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nOui.\\n\" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\\n keep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\\nn\\'est-ce-pas\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This isn\\'t my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I\\'ve been around a while.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are spacemen?\"\\n\\n\\n Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\\n you?\"\\n\\n\\n Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\\nIch danke, senor.\\nYou\\n know why city is called Hoover City?\"\\n\\n\\n Ben didn\\'t answer.\\n\\n\\n \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\\n thousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\\nmonsieur\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAi-yee\\n, I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\\n\\n\\n The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\\n\\n\\n Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\\n faces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him—reddish balloon\\n faces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\\n occasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\\n face with a red beard.\\n\\n\\n A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\\n a dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\\n\\n\\n He needed help.\\n\\n\\n But his picture must have been \\'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\\n reward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\\n Martian kid, perhaps?\\n\\n\\n Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\\n white. He tensed.\\n\\n\\n Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\\n\\n\\n His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\\n\\n\\n And then he saw another and another and another.\\n\\n\\n Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\\n wheel with Ben as their focal point.\\nYou idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\\nLight showered the room in a dazzling explosion. Ben, half blinded,\\n realized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been\\n turned on.\\n\\n\\n The light washed away the room\\'s strangeness and its air of brooding\\n wickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor.\\n\\n\\n Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and\\n a chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like\\n tatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away.\\n\\n\\n Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward,\\n falling.\\n\\n\\n The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised.\\n\\n\\n A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with\\n feline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained\\n undisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in\\n Ben\\'s direction.\\n\\n\\n \"Curtis!\" one of the policemen yelled. \"You\\'re covered! Hold it!\"\\n\\n\\n Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into\\n which the musicians had disappeared.\\n\\n\\n A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air\\n escaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall\\n ahead of him crumbled.\\n\\n\\n He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the\\n mildly stunning neuro-clubs.\\n\\n\\n Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit.\\nAnother second\\n, his brain screamed.\\nJust another second—\\nOr would the exits be guarded?\\n\\n\\n He heard the hiss.\\n\\n\\n It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a\\n slight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle.\\nHe froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be\\n growing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny\\n needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing\\n mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of\\n his body.\\n\\n\\n He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He\\'d have\\n fifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and\\n body overpowered him.\\n\\n\\n In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice\\n yell, \"Turn on the damn lights!\"\\n\\n\\n Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that\\n someone had seized it.\\n\\n\\n A soft feminine voice spoke to him. \"You\\'re wounded? They hit you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\" His thick lips wouldn\\'t let go of the word.\\n\\n\\n \"You want to escape—even now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You may die if you don\\'t give yourself up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, no.\"\\n\\n\\n He tried to stumble toward the exit.\\n\\n\\n \"All right then. Not that way. Here, this way.\"\\n\\n\\n Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight\\n flicked on.\\n\\n\\n Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A\\n door closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his\\n vision—if he still had vision.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re sure?\" the voice persisted.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure,\" Ben managed to say.\\n\\n\\n \"I have no antidote. You may die.\"\\n\\n\\n His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection,\\n massage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain\\n within half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to\\n heart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective\\n weapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender\\n at once.\\n\\n\\n \"Anti ... anti ...\" The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced\\n from his throat. \"No ... I\\'m sure ... sure.\"\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t hear the answer or anything else.\\nBen Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening. Return to\\n consciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black\\n nothingness to a dream-like state of awareness.\\n\\n\\n He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders,\\n hands that massaged, manipulated, fought to restore circulation and\\n sensitivity. He knew they were strong hands. Their strength seemed to\\n transfer itself to his own body.\\n\\n\\n For a long time, he tried to open his eyes. His lids felt welded\\n shut. But after a while, they opened. His world of darkness gave way\\n to a translucent cloak of mist. A round, featureless shape hovered\\n constantly above him—a face, he supposed.\\n\\n\\n He tried to talk. Although his lips moved slightly, the only sound was\\n a deep, staccato grunting.\\n\\n\\n But he heard someone say, \"Don\\'t try to talk.\" It was the same gentle\\n voice he\\'d heard in the Blast Inn. \"Don\\'t talk. Just lie still and\\n rest. Everything\\'ll be all right.\"\\nEverything all right\\n, he thought dimly.\\n\\n\\n There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing. There\\n were periods of light and of darkness. Gradually he grew aware of\\n things. He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spaceman\\'s oxygen\\n mask was clamped over his nose. He felt the heat of electric blankets\\n swathed about his body. Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and\\n he would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach.\\n\\n\\n Always, it seemed, the face was above him, floating in the obscuring\\n mist. Always, it seemed, the soft voice was echoing in his ears:\\n\\n\\n \"Swallow this now. That\\'s it. You must have food.\" Or, \"Close your\\n eyes. Don\\'t strain. It won\\'t be long. You\\'re getting better.\"\\nBetter\\n, he\\'d think.\\nGetting better....\\nAt last, after one of the periods of lethargy, his eyes opened. The\\n mist brightened, then dissolved.\\n\\n\\n He beheld the cracked, unpainted ceiling of a small room, its colorless\\n walls broken with a single, round window. He saw the footboard of his\\n aluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket.\\n\\n\\n Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side.\\n\\n\\n \"You are better?\" the kind voice asked.\\nThe face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twenty-five\\n and thirty. Her features, devoid of makeup, had an unhealthy-looking\\n pallor, as if she hadn\\'t used a sunlamp for many weeks. Yet, at the\\n same time, her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength. Her\\n straight brown hair was combed backward, tight upon her scalp, and\\n drawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck.\\n\\n\\n \"I—I am better,\" he murmured. His words were still slow and thick. \"I\\n am going to live?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will live.\"\\n\\n\\n He thought for a moment. \"How long have I been here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nine days.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You took care of me?\" He noted the deep, dark circles beneath her\\n sleep-robbed eyes.\\n\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re the one who carried me when I was shot?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly he began to cough. Breath came hard. She held the oxygen mask\\n in readiness. He shook his head, not wanting it.\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\" he asked again.\\n\\n\\n \"It would be a long story. Perhaps I\\'ll tell you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\\n A new thought, cloaked in sudden fear, entered his murky consciousness.\\n \"Tell me, will—will I be well again? Will I be able to walk?\"\\n\\n\\n He lay back then, panting, exhausted.\\n\\n\\n \"You have nothing to worry about,\" the girl said softly. Her cool hand\\n touched his hot forehead. \"Rest. We\\'ll talk later.\"\\n\\n\\n His eyes closed and breath came easier. He slept.\\n\\n\\n When he next awoke, his gaze turned first to the window. There was\\n light outside, but he had no way of knowing if this was morning, noon\\n or afternoon—or on what planet.\\n\\n\\n He saw no white-domed buildings of Hoover City, no formal lines of\\n green-treed parks, no streams of buzzing gyro-cars. There was only a\\n translucent and infinite whiteness. It was as if the window were set on\\n the edge of the Universe overlooking a solemn, silent and matterless\\n void.\\n\\n\\n The girl entered the room.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi,\" she said, smiling. The dark half-moons under her eyes were less\\n prominent. Her face was relaxed.\\n\\n\\n She increased the pressure in his rubberex pillows and helped him rise\\n to a sitting position.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are we?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Venus.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re not in Hoover City?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at her, wondering. \"You won\\'t tell me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet. Later, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then how did you get me here? How did we escape from the Inn?\"\\nShe shrugged. \"We have friends who can be bribed. A hiding place in the\\n city, the use of a small desert-taxi, a pass to leave the city—these\\n can be had for a price.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll tell me your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maggie.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did you save me?\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes twinkled mischievously. \"Because you\\'re a good astrogator.\"\\n\\n\\n His own eyes widened. \"How did you know that?\"\\n\\n\\n She sat on a plain chair beside his bed. \"I know everything about you,\\n Lieutenant Curtis.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How did you learn my name? I destroyed all my papers—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know that you\\'re twenty-four. Born July 10, 1971. Orphaned at four,\\n you attended Boys Town in the Catskills till you were 19. You graduated\\n from the Academy at White Sands last June with a major in Astrogation.\\n Your rating for the five-year period was 3.8—the second highest in a\\n class of fifty-seven. Your only low mark in the five years was a 3.2 in\\n History of Martian Civilization. Want me to go on?\"\\n\\n\\n Fascinated, Ben nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"You were accepted as junior astrogation officer aboard the\\nOdyssey\\n.\\n You did well on your flight from Roswell to Luna City. In a barroom\\n fight in Luna City, you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb, a\\n pre-fab salesman. You\\'ve been charged with second degree murder and\\n escape. A reward of 5,000 credits has been offered for your capture.\\n You came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of\\n spacemen who operate beyond Mars. You were looking for them in the\\n Blast Inn.\"\\n\\n\\n He gaped incredulously, struggling to rise from his pillows. \"I—don\\'t\\n get it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are ways of finding out what we want to know. As I told you, we\\n have many friends.\"\\n\\n\\n He fell back into his pillows, breathing hard. She rose quickly.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry,\" she said. \"I shouldn\\'t have told you yet. I felt so happy\\n because you\\'re alive. Rest now. We\\'ll talk again soon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maggie, you—you said I\\'d live. You didn\\'t say I\\'d be able to walk\\n again.\"\\n\\n\\n She lowered her gaze. \"I hope you\\'ll be able to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you don\\'t think I will, do you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know. We\\'ll try walking tomorrow. Don\\'t think about it now.\\n Rest.\"\\n\\n\\n He tried to relax, but his mind was a vortex of conjecture.\\n\\n\\n \"Just one more question,\" he almost whispered.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The man I killed—did he have a wife?\"\\n\\n\\n She hesitated. He thought,\\nDamn it, of all the questions, why did I\\n ask that?\\nFinally she said, \"He had a wife.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Children?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two. I don\\'t know their ages.\"\\n\\n\\n She left the room.\\nHe sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\\n his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\\n\\n\\n He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\\n\\n\\n The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\\n merchant spaceman\\'s uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\\n trimmed\\nred beard\\n!\\n\\n\\n Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\\n restless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\\n brain.\\n\\n\\n The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\\n accused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\\n\\n\\n And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\\n down and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\\n knees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\\n chilling wail in his ears.\\n\\n\\n His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\\n screamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\\n the giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\\n relentlessly toward him.\\n\\n\\n He awoke still screaming....\\n\\n\\n A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie\\'s return, a\\n question already formed in his mind.\\n\\n\\n She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\\n\\n\\n She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\\nwere\\nlooking for him, weren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who is he?\"\\n\\n\\n She sat on the chair beside him.\\n\\n\\n \"My husband,\" she said softly.\\n\\n\\n He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That\\'s\\n why you saved me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n\\n She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\\n Pluto. He\\'s building a new base for us—and a home for me. When his\\n ship returns, I\\'ll be going to him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why aren\\'t you with him now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I\\'ve been\\n studying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\\n Investigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\\n we operate?\"\\n\\n\\n He told her the tales he\\'d heard.\\nShe nodded. \"There are quite a few of us now—about a thousand—and a\\n dozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole.\\n The dome we\\'re in now was designed and built by us a few years ago\\n after we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction,\\n but with almost every advance in space, someone dies.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Venus is getting too civilized. We\\'re moving out and this dome is only\\n a temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base—I might\\n as well tell you it\\'s going to be an asteroid. I won\\'t say which one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t get the idea that we\\'re outlaws. Sure, about half our group is\\n wanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We\\'re just people\\n like yourself and Jacob.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jacob? Your husband?\"\\n\\n\\n She laughed. \"Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn\\'t it?\\n Jacob\\'s anything but that. And just plain \\'Jake\\' reminds one of a\\n grizzled old uranium prospector and he isn\\'t like that, either.\"\\n\\n\\n She lit a cigarette. \"Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond the\\n frontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth—not even\\n to Hoover City—except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejects\\n who couldn\\'t get clearance if they went back to Earth. They know\\n nothing but rocketing and won\\'t give up. They bring in our ships to\\n frontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t the authorities object?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to\\n search the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carry\\n cargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that\\'s\\n scarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether it\\n comes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives mining\\n it, that\\'s our business.\"\\n\\n\\n She pursed her lips. \"But if they guessed how strong we are or that we\\n have friends planted in the I. B. I.—well, things might be different.\\n There probably would be a crackdown.\"\\n\\n\\n Ben scowled. \"What happens if there\\nis\\na crackdown? And what will you\\n do when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can\\'t\\n ignore you then.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them\\n to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we\\'ll be\\n pushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won\\'t be the white-suited\\n boys who\\'ll make that first hop to the stars. It\\ncould\\nbe us, you\\n know—if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. You\\n can\\'t follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make up\\n your own.\"\\nBen stiffened. \"And that\\'s why you want me for an astrogator.\"\\n\\n\\n Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. \"If you want to come—and if you get\\n well.\" She looked at him strangely.\\n\\n\\n \"Suppose—\" He fought to find the right words. \"Suppose I got well and\\n decided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let me\\n go?\"\\n\\n\\n Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion—alarm, then bewilderment,\\n then fear. \"I don\\'t know. That would be up to Jacob.\"\\n\\n\\n He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched his\\n hand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion\\n that had coursed through her.\\n\\n\\n \"The only thing that matters, really,\" she murmured, \"is your walking\\n again. We\\'ll try this afternoon. Okay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob\\'s photo.\\n\\n\\n He was like two people, he thought.\\n\\n\\n Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one single\\n starry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.\\n\\n\\n He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she\\n was alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:\\n\\n\\n \"A Space Officer Is Honest\" \"A Space Officer Is Loyal.\" \"A Space\\n Officer Is Dutiful.\"\\n\\n\\n Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts,\\n mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it\\n prisoner for half a million years.\\n\\n\\n Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead,\\n would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But that meant\\n\\n poaching in a strictly forbidden territory!\\nThe best that could be said for Matilda Penshaws was that she was\\n something of a paradox. She was thirty-three years old, certainly not\\n aged when you consider the fact that the female life expectancy is now\\n up in the sixties, but the lines were beginning to etch their permanent\\n paths across her face and now she needed certain remedial undergarments\\n at which she would have scoffed ten or even five years ago. Matilda was\\n also looking for a husband.\\n\\n\\n This, in itself, was not unusual—but Matilda was so completely\\n wrapped up in the romantic fallacy of her day that she sought a prince\\n charming, a faithful Don Juan, a man who had been everywhere and tasted\\n of every worldly pleasure and who now wanted to sit on a porch and\\n talk about it all to Matilda.\\n\\n\\n The fact that in all probability such a man did not exist disturbed\\n Matilda not in the least. She had been known to say that there are over\\n a billion men in the world, a goodly percentage of whom are eligible\\n bachelors, and that the right one would come along simply because she\\n had been waiting for him.\\n\\n\\n Matilda, you see, had patience.\\n\\n\\n She also had a fetish. Matilda had received her A.B. from exclusive\\n Ursula Johns College and Radcliff had yielded her Masters degree, yet\\n Matilda was an avid follower of the pen pal columns. She would read\\n them carefully and then read them again, looking for the masculine\\n names which, through a system known only to Matilda, had an affinity\\n to her own. To the gentlemen upon whom these names were affixed,\\n Matilda would write, and she often told her mother, the widow Penshaws,\\n that it was in this way she would find her husband. The widow Penshaws\\n impatiently told her to go out and get dates.\\nThat particular night, Matilda pulled her battered old sedan into the\\n garage and walked up the walk to the porch. The widow Penshaws was\\n rocking on the glider and Matilda said hello.\\n\\n\\n The first thing the widow Penshaws did was to take Matilda\\'s left hand\\n in her own and examine the next-to-the-last finger.\\n\\n\\n \"I thought so,\" she said. \"I knew this was coming when I saw that look\\n in your eye at dinner. Where is Herman\\'s engagement ring?\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda smiled. \"It wouldn\\'t have worked out, Ma. He was too darned\\n stuffy. I gave him his ring and said thanks anyway and he smiled\\n politely and said he wished I had told him sooner because his fifteenth\\n college reunion was this weekend and he had already turned down the\\n invitation.\"\\n\\n\\n The widow Penshaws nodded regretfully. \"That was thoughtful of Herman\\n to hide his feelings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hogwash!\" said her daughter. \"He has no true feelings. He\\'s sorry that\\n he had to miss his college reunion. That\\'s all he has to hide. A stuffy\\n Victorian prude and even less of a man than the others.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But, Matilda, that\\'s your fifth broken engagement in three years. It\\n ain\\'t that you ain\\'t popular, but you just don\\'t want to cooperate.\\n You don\\'t\\nfall\\nin love, Matilda—no one does. Love osmoses into you\\n slowly, without you even knowing, and it keeps growing all the time.\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda admired her mother\\'s use of the word osmosis, but she found\\n nothing which was not objectionable about being unaware of the impact\\n of love. She said good-night and went upstairs, climbed out of her\\n light summer dress and took a cold shower.\\n\\n\\n She began to hum to herself. She had not yet seen the pen pal section\\n of the current\\nLiterary Review\\n, and because the subject matter of\\n that magazine was somewhat highbrow and cosmopolitan, she could expect\\n a gratifying selection of pen pals.\\n\\n\\n She shut off the shower, brushed her teeth, gargled, patted herself\\n dry with a towel, and jumped into bed, careful to lock the door of her\\n bedroom. She dared not let the widow Penshaws know that she slept in\\n the nude; the widow Penshaws would object to a girl sleeping in the\\n nude, even if the nearest neighbor was three hundred yards away.\\n\\n\\n Matilda switched her bed lamp on and dabbed some citronella on each\\n ear lobe and a little droplet on her chin \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mhow she hated insects!\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n Then she propped up her pillows—two pillows partially stopped her\\n post-nasal drip; and took the latest issue of the\\nLiterary Review\\noff the night table.\\n\\n\\n She flipped through the pages and came to personals. Someone in\\n Nebraska wanted to trade match books; someone in New York needed a\\n midwestern pen pal, but it was a woman; an elderly man interested in\\n ornithology wanted a young chick correspondent interested in the same\\n subject; a young, personable man wanted an editorial position because\\n he thought he had something to offer the editorial world; and—\\nMatilda read the next one twice. Then she held it close to the light\\n and read it again. The\\nLiterary Review\\nwas one of the few magazines\\n which printed the name of the advertiser rather than a box number, and\\n Matilda even liked the sound of the name. But mostly, she had to admit\\n to herself, it was the flavor of the wording. This very well could be\\nit\\n. Or, that is,\\nhim\\n.\\n\\n\\n Intelligent, somewhat egotistical male who\\'s really been around, whose\\n universal experience can make the average cosmopolite look like a\\n provincial hick, is in need of several female correspondents: must be\\n intelligent, have gumption, be capable of listening to male who has a\\n lot to say and wants to say it. All others need not apply. Wonderful\\n opportunity cultural experience ... Haron Gorka, Cedar Falls, Ill.\\n\\n\\n The man was egotistical, all right; Matilda could see that. But she had\\n never minded an egotistical man, at least not when he had something\\n about which he had a genuine reason to be egotistical. The man sounded\\n as though he would have reason indeed. He only wanted the best because\\n he was the best. Like calls to like.\\n\\n\\n The name—Haron Gorka: its oddness was somehow beautiful to Matilda.\\n Haron Gorka—the nationality could be anything. And that was it. He had\\n no nationality for all intents and purposes; he was an international\\n man, a figure among figures, a paragon....\\n\\n\\n Matilda sighed happily as she put out the light. The moon shone in\\n through the window brightly, and at such times Matilda generally would\\n get up, go to the cupboard, pull out a towel, take two hairpins from\\n her powder drawer, pin the towel to the screen of her window, and hence\\n keep the disturbing moonlight from her eyes. But this time it did not\\n disturb her, and she would let it shine. Cedar Falls was a small town\\n not fifty miles from her home, and she\\'d get there a hop, skip, and\\n jump ahead of her competitors, simply by arriving in person instead of\\n writing a letter.\\n\\n\\n Matilda was not yet that far gone in years or appearance. Dressed\\n properly, she could hope to make a favorable impression in person, and\\n she felt it was important to beat the influx of mail to Cedar Falls.\\nMatilda got out of bed at seven, tiptoed into the bathroom, showered\\n with a merest wary trickle of water, tiptoed back into her bedroom,\\n dressed in her very best cotton over the finest of uplifting and\\n figure-moulding underthings, made sure her stocking seams were\\n perfectly straight, brushed her suede shoes, admired herself in the\\n mirror, read the ad again, wished for a moment she were a bit younger,\\n and tiptoed downstairs.\\n\\n\\n The widow Penshaws met her at the bottom of the stairwell.\\n\\n\\n \"Mother,\" gasped Matilda. Matilda always gasped when she saw something\\n unexpected. \"What on earth are you doing up?\"\\n\\n\\n The widow Penshaws smiled somewhat toothlessly, having neglected to put\\n in both her uppers and lowers this early in the morning. \"I\\'m fixing\\n breakfast, of course....\"\\n\\n\\n Then the widow Penshaws told Matilda that she could never hope to sneak\\n about the house without her mother knowing about it, and that even\\n if she were going out in response to one of those foolish ads in the\\n magazines, she would still need a good breakfast to start with like\\n only mother could cook. Matilda moodily thanked the widow Penshaws.\\nDriving the fifty miles to Cedar Falls in a little less than an hour,\\n Matilda hummed Mendelssohn\\'s Wedding March all the way. It was her\\n favorite piece of music. Once, she told herself: Matilda Penshaws, you\\n are being premature about the whole thing. But she laughed and thought\\n that if she was, she was, and, meanwhile, she could only get to Cedar\\n Falls and find out.\\n\\n\\n And so she got there.\\n\\n\\n The man in the wire cage at the Cedar Falls post office was a\\n stereotype. Matilda always liked to think in terms of stereotypes. This\\n man was small, roundish, florid of face, with a pair of eyeglasses\\n which hung too far down on his nose. Matilda knew he would peer over\\n his glasses and answer questions grudgingly.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello,\" said Matilda.\\n\\n\\n The stereotype grunted and peered at her over his glasses. Matilda\\n asked him where she could find Haron Gorka.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I said, where can I find Haron Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that in the United States?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not a that; it\\'s a he. Where can I find him? Where does he live?\\n What\\'s the quickest way to get there?\"\\n\\n\\n The stereotype pushed up his glasses and looked at her squarely. \"Now\\n take it easy, ma\\'am. First place, I don\\'t know any Haron Gorka—\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda kept the alarm from creeping into her voice. She muttered an\\noh\\nunder her breath and took out the ad. This she showed to the\\n stereotype, and he scratched his bald head. Then he told Matilda almost\\n happily that he was sorry he couldn\\'t help her. He grudgingly suggested\\n that if it really were important, she might check with the police.\\n\\n\\n Matilda did, only they didn\\'t know any Haron Gorka, either. It turned\\n out that no one did: Matilda tried the general store, the fire\\n department, the city hall, the high school, all three Cedar Falls gas\\n stations, the livery stable, and half a dozen private dwellings at\\n random. As far us the gentry of Cedar Falls was concerned, Haron Gorka\\n did not exist.\\n\\n\\n Matilda felt bad, but she had no intention of returning home this\\n early. If she could not find Haron Gorka, that was one thing; but she\\n knew that she\\'d rather not return home and face the widow Penshaws, at\\n least not for a while yet. The widow Penshaws meant well, but she liked\\n to analyze other people\\'s mistakes, especially Matilda\\'s.\\n\\n\\n Accordingly, Matilda trudged wearily toward Cedar Falls\\' small and\\n unimposing library. She could release some of her pent-up aggression by\\n browsing through the dusty slacks.\\n\\n\\n This she did, but it was unrewarding. Cedar Falls had what might be\\n called a microscopic library, and Matilda thought that if this small\\n building were filled with microfilm rather than books, the library\\n still would be lacking. Hence she retraced her steps and nodded to the\\n old librarian as she passed.\\nThen Matilda frowned. Twenty years from now, this could be Matilda\\n Penshaws—complete with plain gray dress, rimless spectacles, gray\\n hair, suspicious eyes, and a broom-stick figure....\\n\\n\\n On the other hand—why not? Why couldn\\'t the librarian help her? Why\\n hadn\\'t she thought of it before? Certainly a man as well-educated as\\n Haron Gorka would be an avid reader, and unless he had a permanent\\n residence here in Cedar Palls, one couldn\\'t expect that he\\'d have his\\n own library with him. This being the case, a third-rate collection\\n of books was far better than no collection at all, and perhaps the\\n librarian would know Mr. Haron Gorka.\\n\\n\\n Matilda cleared her throat. \"Pardon me,\" she began. \"I\\'m looking for—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Haron Gorka.\" The librarian nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"How on earth did you know?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s easy. You\\'re the sixth young woman who came here inquiring\\n about that man today. Six of you—five others in the morning, and now\\n you in the afternoon. I never did trust this Mr. Gorka....\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda jumped as if she had been struck strategically from the rear.\\n \"You know him? You know Haron Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly. Of course I know him. He\\'s our steadiest reader here at\\n the library. Not a week goes by that he doesn\\'t take out three, four\\n books. Scholarly gentleman, but not without charm. If I were twenty\\n years younger—\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda thought a little flattery might be effective. \"Only ten,\" she\\n assured the librarian. \"Ten years would be more than sufficient, I\\'m\\n sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you? Well. Well, well.\" The librarian did something with the back\\n of her hair, but it looked the same as before. \"Maybe you\\'re right.\\n Maybe you\\'re right at that.\" Then she sighed. \"But I guess a miss is as\\n good as a mile.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I mean anyone would like to correspond with Haron Gorka. Or to know\\n him well. To be considered his friend. Haron Gorka....\"\\n\\n\\n The librarian seemed about to soar off into the air someplace, and if\\n five women had been here first, Matilda was now definitely in a hurry.\\n\\n\\n \"Um, where can I find Mr. Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not supposed to do this, you know. We\\'re not permitted to give the\\n addresses of any of our people. Against regulations, my dear.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about the other five women?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They convinced me that I ought to give them his address.\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda reached into her pocket-book and withdrew a five dollar bill.\\n \"Was this the way?\" she demanded. Matilda was not very good at this\\n sort of thing.\\n\\n\\n The librarian shook her head.\\n\\n\\n Matilda nodded shrewdly and added a twin brother to the bill in her\\n hand. \"Then is this better?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s worse. I wouldn\\'t take your money—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry. What then?\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I can\\'t enjoy an association with Haron Gorka directly, I still\\n could get the vicarious pleasure of your contact with him. Report to me\\n faithfully and you\\'ll get his address. That\\'s what the other five will\\n do, and with half a dozen of you, I\\'ll get an overall picture. Each one\\n of you will tell me about Haron Gorka, sparing no details. You each\\n have a distinct personality, of course, and it will color each picture\\n considerably. But with six of you reporting, I should receive my share\\n of vicarious enjoyment. Is it—ah—a deal?\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda assured her that it was, and, breathlessly, she wrote down the\\n address. She thanked the librarian and then she went out to her car,\\n whistling to herself.\\nHaron Gorka lived in what could have been an agrarian estate, except\\n that the land no longer was being tilled. The house itself had fallen\\n to ruin. This surprised Matilda, but she did not let it keep her\\n spirits in check. Haron Gorka, the man, was what counted, and the\\n librarian\\'s account of him certainly had been glowing enough. Perhaps\\n he was too busy with his cultural pursuits to pay any real attention to\\n his dwelling. That was it, of course: the conspicuous show of wealth or\\n personal industry meant nothing at all to Haron Gorka. Matilda liked\\n him all the more for it.\\n\\n\\n There were five cars parked in the long driveway, and now Matilda\\'s\\n made the sixth. In spite of herself, she smiled. She had not been the\\n only one with the idea to visit Haron Gorka in person. With half a\\n dozen of them there, the laggards who resorted to posting letters would\\n be left far behind. Matilda congratulated herself for what she thought\\n had been her ingenuity, and which now turned out to be something which\\n she had in common with five other women. You live and learn, thought\\n Matilda. And then, quite annoyedly, she berated herself for not having\\n been the first. Perhaps the other five all were satisfactory; perhaps\\n she wouldn\\'t be needed; perhaps she was too late....\\nAs it turned out, she wasn\\'t. Not only that, she was welcomed with open\\n arms. Not by Haron Gorka; that she really might have liked. Instead,\\n someone she could only regard as a menial met her, and when he asked\\n had she come in response to the advertisement, she nodded eagerly.\\n He told her that was fine and he ushered her straight into a room\\n which evidently was to be her living quarters. It contained a small\\n undersized bed, a table, and a chair, and, near a little slot in the\\n wall, there was a button.\\n\\n\\n \"You want any food or drink,\" the servant told her, \"and you just press\\n that button. The results will surprise you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What about Mr. Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n \"When he wants you, he will send for you. Meanwhile, make yourself to\\n home, lady, and I will tell him you are here.\"\\n\\n\\n A little doubtful now, Matilda thanked him and watched him leave. He\\n closed the door softly behind his retreating feet, but Matilda\\'s ears\\n had not missed the ominous click. She ran to the door and tried to open\\n it, but it would not budge. It was locked—from the outside.\\n\\n\\n It must be said to Matilda\\'s favor that she sobbed only once. After\\n that she realized that what is done is done and here, past thirty,\\n she wasn\\'t going to be girlishly timid about it. Besides, it was not\\n her fault if, in his unconcern, Haron Gorka had unwittingly hired a\\n neurotic servant.\\n\\n\\n For a time Matilda paced back and forth in her room, and of what was\\n going on outside she could hear nothing. In that case, she would\\n pretend that there was nothing outside the little room, and presently\\n she lay down on the bed to take a nap. This didn\\'t last long, however:\\n she had a nightmare in which Haron Gorka appeared as a giant with two\\n heads, but, upon awaking with a start, she immediately ascribed that to\\n her overwrought nerves.\\n\\n\\n At that point she remembered what the servant had said about food and\\n she thought at once of the supreme justice she could do to a juicy\\n beefsteak. Well, maybe they didn\\'t have a beefsteak. In that case, she\\n would take what they had, and, accordingly, she walked to the little\\n slot in the wall and pressed the button.\\n\\n\\n She heard the whir of machinery. A moment later there was a soft\\n sliding sound. Through the slot first came a delicious aroma, followed\\n almost instantly by a tray. On the tray were a bowl of turtle soup,\\n mashed potatoes, green peas, bread, a strange cocktail, root-beer, a\\n parfait—and a thick tenderloin sizzling in hot butter sauce.\\nMatilda gasped once and felt about to gasp again—but by then her\\n salivary glands were working overtime, and she ate her meal. The fact\\n that it was precisely what she would have wanted could, of course, be\\n attributed to coincidence, and the further fact that everything was\\n extremely palatable made her forget all about Haron Gorka\\'s neurotic\\n servant.\\n\\n\\n When she finished her meal a pleasant lethargy possessed her, and in a\\n little while Matilda was asleep again. This time she did not dream at\\n all. It was a deep sleep and a restful one, and when she awoke it was\\n with the wonderful feeling that everything was all right.\\nThe feeling did not last long. Standing over her was Haron Gorka\\'s\\n servant, and he said, \"Mr. Gorka will see you now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now. That\\'s what you\\'re here for, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n He had a point there, but Matilda hardly even had time to fix her hair.\\n She told the servant so.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss,\" he replied, \"I assure you it will not matter in the least to\\n Haron Gorka. You are here and he is ready to see you and that is all\\n that matters.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You sure?\" Matilda wanted to take no chances.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Come.\"\\n\\n\\n She followed him out of the little room and across what should have\\n been a spacious dining area, except that everything seemed covered with\\n dust. Of the other women Matilda could see nothing, and she suddenly\\n realized that each of them probably had a cubicle of a room like her\\n own, and that each in her turn had already had her first visit with\\n Haron Gorka. Well, then, she must see to it that she impressed him\\n better than did all the rest, and, later, when she returned to tell the\\n old librarian of her adventures, she could perhaps draw her out and\\n compare notes.\\n\\n\\n She would not admit even to herself that she was disappointed with\\n Haron Gorka. It was not that he was homely and unimpressive; it was\\n just that he was so\\nordinary\\n-looking. She almost would have preferred\\n the monster of her dreams.\\nHe wore a white linen suit and he had mousy hair, drab eyes, an\\n almost-Roman nose, a petulant mouth with the slight arch of the egotist\\n at each corner.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Greetings. You have come—\"\\n\\n\\n \"In response to your ad. How do you do, Mr. Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n She hoped she wasn\\'t being too formal. But, then, there was no sense in\\n assuming that he would like informality. She could only wait and see\\n and adjust her own actions to suit him. Meanwhile, it would be best to\\n keep on the middle of the road.\\n\\n\\n \"I am fine. Are you ready?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly. You came in response to my ad. You want to hear me talk, do\\n you not?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I—do.\" Matilda had had visions of her prince charming sitting back\\n and relaxing with her, telling her of the many things he had done and\\n seen. But first she certainly would have liked to get to\\nknow\\nthe\\n man. Well, Haron Gorka obviously had more experience along these lines\\n than she did. He waited, however, as if wondering what to say, and\\n Matilda, accustomed to social chatter, gave him a gambit.\\n\\n\\n \"I must admit I was surprised when I got exactly what I wanted for\\n dinner,\" she told him brightly.\\n\\n\\n \"Eh? What say? Oh, yes, naturally. A combination of telepathy and\\n teleportation. The synthetic cookery is attuned to your mind when you\\n press the buzzer, and the strength of your psychic impulses determines\\n how closely the meal will adjust to your desires. The fact that the\\n adjustment here was near perfect is commendable. It means either that\\n you have a high psi-quotient, or that you were very hungry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Matilda vaguely. Perhaps it might be better, after all, if\\n Haron Gorka were to talk to her as he saw fit.\\n\\n\\n \"Ready?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Uh—ready.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what, Mr. Gorka?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would you like me to talk about?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, anything.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please. As the ad read, my universal experience—is universal.\\n Literally. You\\'ll have to be more specific.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, why don\\'t you tell me about some of your far travels?\\n Unfortunately, while I\\'ve done a lot of reading, I haven\\'t been to all\\n the places I would have liked—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good enough. You know, of course, how frigid Deneb VII is?\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda said, \"Beg pardon?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, there was the time our crew—before I had retired, of\\n course—made a crash landing there. We could survive in the vac-suits,\\n of course, but the\\nthlomots\\nwere after us almost at once. They go\\n mad over plastic. They will eat absolutely any sort of plastic. Our\\n vac-suits—\"\\n\"—were made of plastic,\" Matilda suggested. She did not understand a\\n thing he was talking about, but she felt she had better act bright.\\n\\n\\n \"No, no. Must you interrupt? The air-hose and the water feed, these\\n were plastic. Not the rest of the suit. The point is that half of us\\n were destroyed before the rescue ship could come, and the remainder\\n were near death. I owe my life to the mimicry of a\\nflaak\\nfrom Capella\\n III. It assumed the properties of plastic and led the\\nthlomots\\na\\n merry chase across the frozen surface of D VII. You travel in the Deneb\\n system now and Interstellar Ordinance makes it mandatory to carry\\nflaaks\\nwith you. Excellent idea, really excellent.\"\\nAlmost at once, Matilda\\'s educational background should have told her\\n that Haron Gorka was mouthing gibberish. But on the other hand she\\nwanted\\nto believe in him and the result was that it took until now\\n for her to realize it.\\n\\n\\n \"Stop making fun of me,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"So, naturally, you\\'ll see\\nflaaks\\nall over that system—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stop!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that? Making fun of you?\" Haron Gorka\\'s voice had been so\\n eager as he spoke, high-pitched, almost like a child\\'s, and now he\\n seemed disappointed. He smiled, but it was a sad smile, a smile of\\n resignation, and he said, \"Very well. I\\'m wrong again. You are the\\n sixth, and you\\'re no better than the other five. Perhaps you are even\\n more outspoken. When you see my wife, tell her to come back. Again she\\n is right and I am wrong....\"\\n\\n\\n Haron Gorka turned his back.\\n\\n\\n Matilda could do nothing but leave the room, walk back through the\\n house, go outside and get into her car. She noticed not without\\n surprise that the other five cars were now gone. She was the last of\\n Haron Gorka\\'s guests to depart.\\n\\n\\n As she shifted into reverse and pulled out of the driveway, she saw\\n the servant leaving, too. Far down the road, he was walking slowly.\\n Then Haron Gorka had severed that relationship, too, and now he was all\\n alone.\\n\\n\\n As she drove back to town, the disappointment melted slowly away. There\\n were, of course, two alternatives. Either Haron Gorka was an eccentric\\n who enjoyed this sort of outlandish tomfoolery, or else he was plainly\\n insane. She could still picture him ranting on aimlessly to no one in\\n particular about places which had no existence outside of his mind, his\\n voice high-pitched and eager.\\nIt was not until she had passed the small library building that she\\n remembered what she had promised the librarian. In her own way, the\\n aging woman would be as disappointed as Matilda, but a promise was a\\n promise, and Matilda turned the car in a wide U-turn and parked it\\n outside the library.\\n\\n\\n The woman sat at her desk as Matilda had remembered her, gray,\\n broom-stick figure, rigid. But now when she saw Matilda she perked up\\n visibly.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, my dear,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re back a bit sooner than I expected. But, then, the other five\\n have returned, too, and I imagine your story will be similar.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know what they told you,\" Matilda said. \"But this is what\\n happened to me.\"\\n\\n\\n She quickly then related everything which had happened, completely and\\n in detail. She did this first because it was a promise, and second\\n because she knew it would make her feel better.\\n\\n\\n \"So,\" she finished, \"Haron Gorka is either extremely eccentric or\\n insane. I\\'m sorry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s neither,\" the librarian contradicted. \"Perhaps he is slightly\\n eccentric by your standards, but really, my dear, he is neither.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did he leave a message for his wife?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, yes. Yes, he did. But how did you know? Oh, I suppose he told the\\n five.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. He didn\\'t. But you were the last and I thought he would give you a\\n message for his wife—\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda didn\\'t understand. She didn\\'t understand at all, but she told\\n the little librarian what the message was. \"He wanted her to return,\"\\n she said.\\n\\n\\n The librarian nodded, a happy smile on her lips. \"You wouldn\\'t believe\\n me if I told you something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am Mrs. Gorka.\"\\n\\n\\n The librarian stood up and came around the desk. She opened a drawer\\n and took out her hat and perched it jauntily atop her gray hair. \"You\\n see, my dear, Haron expects too much. He expects entirely too much.\"\\n\\n\\n Matilda did not say a word. One madman a day would be quite enough for\\n anybody, but here she found herself confronted with two.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve been tripping for centuries, visiting every habitable star\\n system from our home near Canopus. But Haron is too demanding. He\\n says I am a finicky traveler, that he could do much better alone, the\\n accommodations have to be just right for me, and so forth. When he\\n loses his temper, he tries to convince me that any number of females of\\n the particular planet would be more than thrilled if they were given\\n the opportunity just to listen to him.\\n\\n\\n \"But he\\'s wrong. It\\'s a hard life for a woman. Someday—five thousand,\\n ten thousand years from now—I will convince him. And then we will\\n settle down on Canopus XIV and cultivate\\ntorgas\\n. That would be so\\n nice—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if Haron wants me back, then I have to go. Have a care, my dear.\\n If you marry, choose a home-body. I\\'ve had the experience and you\\'ve\\n seen my Haron for yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n And then the woman was gone. Numbly, Matilda walked to the doorway and\\n watched her angular figure disappear down the road. Of all the crazy\\n things....\\n\\n\\n Deneb and Capella and Canopus, these were stars. Add a number and you\\n might have a planet revolving about each star. Of all the insane—\\n\\n\\n They were mad, all right, and now Matilda wondered if, actually,\\n they were husband and wife. It could readily be; maybe the madness\\n was catching. Maybe if you thought too much about such things, such\\n travels, you could get that way. Of course, Herman represented the\\n other extreme, and Herman was even worse in his own way—but hereafter\\n Matilda would seek the happy medium.\\n\\n\\n And, above all else, she had had enough of her pen pal columns. They\\n were, she realized, for kids.\\nShe ate dinner in Cedar Falls and then she went out to her car again,\\n preparing for the journey back home. The sun had set and it was a clear\\n night, and overhead the great broad sweep of the Milky Way was a pale\\n rainbow bridge in the sky.\\n\\n\\n Matilda paused. Off in the distance there was a glow on the horizon,\\n and that was the direction of Haron Gorka\\'s place.\\n\\n\\n The glow increased; soon it was a bright red pulse pounding on the\\n horizon. It flickered. It flickered again, and finally it was gone.\\n\\n\\n The stars were white and brilliant in the clear country air. That was\\n why Matilda liked the country better than the city, particularly on a\\n clear summer night when you could see the span of the Milky Way.\\n\\n\\n But abruptly the stars and the Milky Way were paled by the brightest\\n shooting star Matilda had ever seen. It flashed suddenly and it\\n remained in view for a full second, searing a bright orange path across\\n the night sky.\\n\\n\\n Matilda gasped and ran into her car. She started the gears and pressed\\n the accelerator to the floor, keeping it there all the way home.\\n\\n\\n It was the first time she had ever seen a shooting star going\\nup\\n.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Giles made the expected\\n comments, smiled the proper\\n smiles and greeted his staff by\\n the right names, but it was purely\\n automatic. Somehow, thinking\\n had grown difficult in the mornings\\n recently.\\nInside his private office, he\\n dropped all pretense and slumped\\n into the padding of his chair, gasping\\n for breath and feeling his\\n heart hammering in his chest.\\n He’d been a fool to come to work,\\n he realized. But with the Procyon\\n shuttle arriving yesterday, there\\n was no telling what might turn\\n up. Besides, that fool of a medicist\\n had sworn the shot would\\n cure any allergy or asthma.\\nGiles heard his secretary come\\n in, but it wasn’t until the smell\\n of the coffee reached his nose\\n that he looked up. She handed\\n him a filled cup and set the carafe\\n down on the age-polished surface\\n of the big desk. She watched\\n solicitously as he drank.\\n“That bad, Arthur?” she asked.\\n“Just a little tired,” he told\\n her, refilling the cup. She’d made\\n the coffee stronger than usual\\n and it seemed to cut through\\n some of the thickness in his head.\\n “I guess I’m getting old, Amanda.”\\nShe smiled dutifully at the\\n time-worn joke, but he knew she\\n wasn’t fooled. She’d cycled to\\n middle age four times in her\\n job and she probably knew him\\n better than he knew himself—which\\n wouldn’t be hard, he\\n thought. He’d hardly recognized\\n the stranger in the mirror as he\\n tried to shave. His normal thinness\\n had looked almost gaunt\\n and there were hollows in his\\n face and circles under his eyes.\\n Even his hair had seemed thinner,\\n though that, of course, was\\n impossible.\\n“Anything urgent on the Procyon\\n shuttle?” he asked as she\\n continue staring at him with worried\\n eyes.\\nSHE JERKED her gaze away\\n guiltily and turned to the incoming\\n basket. “Mostly drugs for\\n experimenting. A personal letter\\n for you, relayed from some place\\n I never heard of. And one of the\\n super-light missiles! They found\\n it drifting half a light-year out\\n and captured it. Jordan’s got a\\n report on it and he’s going crazy.\\n But if you don’t feel well—”\\n“I’m all right!” he told her\\n sharply. Then he steadied himself\\n and managed to smile. “Thanks\\n for the coffee, Amanda.”\\nShe accepted dismissal reluctantly.\\n When she was gone, he\\n sat gazing at the report from Jordan\\n at Research.\\nFor eighty years now, they’d\\n been sending out the little ships\\n that vanished at greater than the\\n speed of light, equipped with\\n every conceivable device to make\\n them return automatically after\\n taking pictures of wherever they\\n arrived. So far, none had ever returned\\n or been located. This was\\n the first hope they’d found that\\n the century-long trips between\\n stars in the ponderous shuttles\\n might be ended and he should\\n have been filled with excitement\\n at Jordan’s hasty preliminary report.\\nHe leafed through it. The little\\n ship apparently had been picked\\n up by accident when it almost\\n collided with a Sirius-local ship.\\n Scientists there had puzzled over\\n it, reset it and sent it back. The\\n two white rats on it had still been\\n alive.\\nGiles dropped the report wearily\\n and picked up the personal\\n message that had come on the\\n shuttle. He fingered the microstrip\\n inside while he drank another\\n coffee, and finally pulled\\n out the microviewer. There were\\n three frames to the message, he\\n saw with some surprise.\\nHe didn’t need to see the signature\\n on the first projection.\\n Only his youngest son would have\\n sent an elaborate tercentenary\\n greeting verse—one that would\\n arrive ninety years too late! Harry\\n had been born just before Earth\\n passed the drastic birth limitation\\n act and his mother had\\n spoiled him. He’d even tried to\\n avoid the compulsory emigration\\n draft and stay on with his mother.\\n It had been the bitter quarrels\\n over that which had finally\\n broken Giles’ fifth marriage.\\nOddly enough, the message in\\n the next frame showed none of\\n that. Harry had nothing but\\n praise for the solar system where\\n he’d been sent. He barely mentioned\\n being married on the way\\n or his dozen children, but filled\\n most of the frame with glowing\\n description and a plea for his\\n father to join him there!\\nGILES SNORTED and turned\\n to the third frame, which\\n showed a group picture of the\\n family in some sort of vehicle,\\n against the background of an alien\\n but attractive world.\\nHe had no desire to spend\\n ninety years cooped up with a\\n bunch of callow young emigrants,\\n even in one of the improved Exodus\\n shuttles. And even if Exodus\\n ever got the super-light\\n drive working, there was no reason\\n he should give up his work.\\n The discovery that men could\\n live practically forever had put\\n an end to most family ties; sentiment\\n wore thin in half a century—which\\n wasn’t much time\\n now, though it had once seemed\\n long enough.\\nStrange how the years seemed\\n to get shorter as their number increased.\\n There’d been a song\\n once—something about the years\\n dwindling down. He groped for\\n the lines and couldn’t remember.\\n Drat it! Now he’d probably lie\\n awake most of the night again,\\n trying to recall them.\\nThe outside line buzzed musically,\\n flashing Research’s number.\\n Giles grunted in irritation. He\\n wasn’t ready to face Jordan yet.\\n But he shrugged and pressed the\\n button.\\nThe intense face that looked\\n from the screen was frowning as\\n Jordan’s eyes seemed to sweep\\n around the room. He was still\\n young—one of the few under\\n a hundred who’d escaped deportation\\n because of special ability—and\\n patience was still foreign to\\n him.\\nThen the frown vanished as\\n an expression of shock replaced\\n it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.\\n If he looked\\nthat\\nbad—\\nBut Jordan wasn’t looking at\\n him; the man’s interest lay in the\\n projected picture from Harry, across\\n the desk from the communicator.\\n“Antigravity!” His voice was\\n unbelieving as he turned his head\\n to face the older man. “What\\n world is that?”\\nGiles forced his attention on\\n the picture again and this time\\n he noticed the vehicle shown. It\\n was enough like an old model\\n Earth conveyance to pass casual\\n inspection, but it floated wheellessly\\n above the ground. Faint\\n blur lines indicated it had been\\n moving when the picture was\\n taken.\\n“One of my sons—” Giles\\n started to answer. “I could find\\n the star’s designation....”\\nJordan cursed harshly. “So we\\n can send a message on the shuttle,\\n begging for their secret in a\\n couple of hundred years! While\\n a hundred other worlds make a\\n thousand major discoveries they\\n don’t bother reporting! Can’t the\\n Council see\\nanything\\n?”\\nGiles had heard it all before.\\n Earth was becoming a backwater\\n world; no real progress had been\\n made in two centuries; the young\\n men were sent out as soon as\\n their first fifty years of education\\n were finished, and the older men\\n were too conservative for really\\n new thinking. There was a measure\\n of truth in it, unfortunately.\\n“They’ll slow up when their\\n populations fill,” Giles repeated\\n his old answers. “We’re still ahead\\n in medicine and we’ll get the\\n other discoveries eventually, without\\n interrupting the work of making\\n the Earth fit for our longevity.\\n We can wait. We’ll have to.”\\nTHE YOUNGER man stared\\n at him with the strange puzzled\\n look Giles had seen too often\\n lately. “Damn it, haven’t you read\\n my report? We know the super-light\\n drive works! That missile\\n reached Sirius in less than ten\\n days. We can have the secret of\\n this antigravity in less than a\\n year! We—”\\n“Wait a minute.” Giles felt the\\n thickness pushing back at his\\n mind and tried to fight it off. He’d\\n only skimmed the report, but this\\n made no sense. “You mean you\\n can calibrate your guiding devices\\n accurately enough to get a\\n missile where you want it and\\n back?”\\n“\\nWhat?\\n” Jordan’s voice rattled\\n the speaker. “Of course not! It\\n took two accidents to get the\\n thing back to us—and with a\\n half-light-year miss that delayed\\n it about twenty years before the\\n Procyon shuttle heard its signal.\\n Pre-setting a course may take\\n centuries, if we can ever master\\n it. Even with Sirius expecting the\\n missiles and ready to cooperate.\\n I mean the big ship. We’ve had it\\n drafted for building long enough;\\n now we can finish it in three\\n months. We know the drive works.\\n We know it’s fast enough to reach\\n Procyon in two weeks. We even\\n know life can stand the trip. The\\n rats were unharmed.”\\nGiles shook his head at what\\n the other was proposing, only\\n partly believing it. “Rats don’t\\n have minds that could show any\\n real damage such as the loss of\\n power to rejuvenate. We can’t put\\n human pilots into a ship with our\\n drive until we’ve tested it more\\n thoroughly, Bill, even if they\\n could correct for errors on arrival.\\n Maybe if we put in stronger signaling\\n transmitters....”\\n“Yeah. Maybe in two centuries\\n we’d have a through route charted\\n to Sirius. And we still wouldn’t\\n have proved it safe for human\\n pilots. Mr. Giles, we’ve got to\\n have the big ship. All we need is\\none\\nvolunteer!”\\nIt occurred to Giles then that\\n the man had been too fired with\\n the idea to think. He leaned back,\\n shaking his head again wearily.\\n “All right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.\\n Or how about you? Do\\n you really want to risk losing the\\n rest of your life rather than waiting\\n a couple more centuries until\\n we know it’s safe? If you do, I’ll\\n order the big ship.”\\nJordan opened his mouth and\\n for a second Giles’ heart caught\\n in a flux of emotions as the\\n man’s offer hovered on his lips.\\n Then the engineer shut his mouth\\n slowly. The belligerence ran out\\n of him.\\nHe looked sick, for he had no\\n answer.\\nNO SANE man would risk a\\n chance for near eternity\\n against such a relatively short\\n wait. Heroism had belonged to\\n those who knew their days were\\n numbered, anyhow.\\n“Forget it, Bill,” Giles advised.\\n “It may take longer, but eventually\\n we’ll find a way. With time\\n enough, we’re bound to. And\\n when we do, the ship will be\\n ready.”\\nThe engineer nodded miserably\\n and clicked off. Giles turned\\n from the blank screen to stare\\n out of the windows, while his\\n hand came up to twist at the lock\\n of hair over his forehead. Eternity!\\n They had to plan and build\\n for it. They couldn’t risk that\\n plan for short-term benefits. Usually\\n it was too easy to realize that,\\n and the sight of the solid, time-enduring\\n buildings outside should\\n have given him a sense of security.\\nToday, though, nothing seemed\\n to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\\n somehow lost; the city beyond\\n the window blurred as he\\n studied it, and he swung the chair\\n back so violently that his hand\\n jerked painfully on the forelock\\n he’d been twisting.\\nThen he was staring unbelievingly\\n at the single white hair that\\n was twisted with the dark ones\\n between his fingers.\\nLike an automaton, he bent\\n forward, his other hand groping\\n for the mirror that should be in\\n one of the drawers. The dull pain\\n in his chest sharpened and his\\n breath was hoarse in his throat,\\n but he hardly noticed as he found\\n the mirror and brought it up. His\\n eyes focused reluctantly. There\\n were other white strands in his\\n dark hair.\\nThe mirror crashed to the floor\\n as he staggered out of the office.\\nIt was only two blocks to Giles’\\n residence club, but he had to\\n stop twice to catch his breath\\n and fight against the pain that\\n clawed at his chest. When he\\n reached the wood-paneled lobby,\\n he was barely able to stand.\\nDubbins was at his side almost\\n at once, with a hand under\\n his arm to guide him toward his\\n suite.\\n“Let me help you, sir,” Dubbins\\n suggested, in the tones\\n Giles hadn’t heard since the man\\n had been his valet, back when\\n it was still possible to find personal\\n servants. Now he managed\\n the club on a level of quasi-equality\\n with the members. For the\\n moment, though, he’d slipped\\n back into the old ways.\\nGILES FOUND himself lying\\n on his couch, partially undressed,\\n with the pillows just right\\n and a long drink in his hand. The\\n alcohol combined with the reaction\\n from his panic to leave him\\n almost himself again. After all,\\n there was nothing to worry about;\\n Earth’s doctors could cure anything.\\n“I guess you’d better call Dr.\\n Vincenti,” he decided. Vincenti\\n was a member and would probably\\n be the quickest to get.\\nDubbins shook his head. “Dr.\\n Vincenti isn’t with us, sir. He\\n left a year ago to visit a son in\\n the Centauri system. There’s a\\n Dr. Cobb whose reputation is\\n very good, sir.”\\nGiles puzzled over it doubtfully.\\n Vincenti had been an oddly\\n morose man the last few times\\n he’d seen him, but that could\\n hardly explain his taking a twenty-year\\n shuttle trip for such a\\n slim reason. It was no concern of\\n his, though. “Dr. Cobb, then,” he\\n said.\\nGiles heard the other man’s\\n voice on the study phone, too low\\n for the words to be distinguishable.\\n He finished the drink, feeling\\n still better, and was sitting\\n up when Dubbins came back.\\n“Dr. Cobb wants you to come\\n to his office at once, sir,” he said,\\n dropping to his knee to help\\n Giles with his shoes. “I’d be\\n pleased to drive you there.”\\nGiles frowned. He’d expected\\n Cobb to come to him. Then he\\n grimaced at his own thoughts.\\n Dubbins’ manners must have carried\\n him back into the past; doctors\\n didn’t go in for home visits\\n now—they preferred to see their\\n patients in the laboratories that\\n housed their offices. If this kept\\n on, he’d be missing the old days\\n when he’d had a mansion and\\n counted his wealth in possessions,\\n instead of the treasures he could\\n build inside himself for the future\\n ahead. He was getting positively\\n childish!\\nYet he relished the feeling of\\n having Dubbins drive his car.\\n More than anything else, he’d\\n loved being driven. Even after\\n chauffeurs were a thing of the\\n past, Harry had driven him\\n around. Now he’d taken to walking,\\n as so many others had, for\\n even with modern safety measures\\n so strict, there was always\\n a small chance of some accident\\n and nobody had any desire to\\n spend the long future as a cripple.\\n“I’ll wait for you, sir,” Dubbins\\n offered as they stopped beside\\n the low, massive medical building.\\nIt was almost too much consideration.\\n Giles nodded, got out\\n and headed down the hall uncertainly.\\n Just how bad did he\\n look? Well, he’d soon find out.\\nHe located the directory and\\n finally found the right office, its\\n reception room wall covered\\n with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had\\n picked up in some three hundred\\n years of practice. Giles felt\\n better, realizing it wouldn’t be\\n one of the younger men.\\nCOBB APPEARED himself,\\n before the nurse could take\\n over, and led Giles into a room\\n with an old-fashioned desk and\\n chairs that almost concealed the\\n cabinets of equipment beyond.\\nHe listened as Giles stumbled\\n out his story. Halfway through,\\n the nurse took a blood sample\\n with one of the little mosquito\\n needles and the machinery behind\\n the doctor began working on\\n it.\\n“Your friend told me about the\\n gray hair, of course,” Cobb said.\\n At Giles’ look, he smiled faintly.\\n “Surely you didn’t think people\\n could miss that in this day and\\n age? Let’s see it.”\\nHe inspected it and began\\n making tests. Some were older\\n than Giles could remember—knee\\n reflex, blood pressure, pulse\\n and fluoroscope. Others involved\\n complicated little gadgets that\\n ran over his body, while meters\\n bobbed and wiggled. The blood\\n check came through and Cobb\\n studied it, to go back and make\\n further inspections of his own.\\nAt last he nodded slowly.\\n “Hyper-catabolism, of course. I\\n thought it might be. How long\\n since you had your last rejuvenation?\\n And who gave it?”\\n“About ten years ago,” Giles\\n answered. He found his identity\\n card and passed it over, while\\n the doctor studied it. “My sixteenth.”\\nIt wasn’t going right. He could\\n feel it. Some of the panic symptoms\\n were returning; the pulse in\\n his neck was pounding and his\\n breath was growing difficult.\\n Sweat ran down his sides from\\n his armpit and he wiped his palms\\n against his coat.\\n“Any particular emotional\\n strain when you were treated—some\\n major upset in your life?”\\n Cobb asked.\\nGiles thought as carefully as\\n he could, but he remembered\\n nothing like that. “You mean—it\\n didn’t take? But I never had\\n any trouble, Doctor. I was one of\\n the first million cases, when a\\n lot of people couldn’t rejuvenate\\n at all, and I had no trouble even\\n then.”\\nCobb considered it, hesitated as\\n if making up his mind to be frank\\n against his better judgment. “I\\n can’t see any other explanation.\\n You’ve got a slight case of angina—nothing\\n serious, but quite definite—as\\n well as other signs\\n of aging. I’m afraid the treatment\\n didn’t take fully. It might have\\n been some unconscious block\\n on your part, some infection not\\n diagnosed at the time, or even a\\n fault in the treatment. That’s\\n pretty rare, but we can’t neglect\\n the possibility.”\\nHE STUDIED his charts again\\n and then smiled. “So we’ll\\n give you another treatment. Any\\n reason you can’t begin immediately?”\\nGiles remembered that Dubbins\\n was waiting for him, but this\\n was more important. It hadn’t\\n been a joke about his growing old,\\n after all. But now, in a few days,\\n he’d be his old—no, of course\\n not—his young self again!\\nThey went down the hall to\\n another office, where Giles waited\\n outside while Cobb conferred\\n with another doctor and technician,\\n with much waving of charts.\\n He resented every second of it.\\n It was as if the almost forgotten\\n specter of age stood beside him,\\n counting the seconds. But at last\\n they were through and he was led\\n into the quiet rejuvenation room,\\n where the clamps were adjusted\\n about his head and the earpieces\\n were fitted. The drugs were shot\\n painlessly into his arm and the\\n light-pulser was adjusted to his\\n brain-wave pattern.\\nIt had been nothing like this his\\n first time. Then it had required\\n months of mental training, followed\\n by crude mechanical and\\n drug hypnosis for other months.\\n Somewhere in every human brain\\n lay the memory of what his cells\\n had been like when he was young.\\n Or perhaps it lay in the cells\\n themselves, with the brain as only\\n a linkage to it. They’d discovered\\n that, and the fact that the mind\\n could effect physical changes in\\n the body. Even such things as\\n cancer could be willed out of existence—provided\\n the brain\\n could be reached far below the\\n conscious level and forced to\\n operate.\\nThere had been impossible\\n faith cures for millenia—cataracts\\n removed from blinded eyes\\n within minutes, even—but finding\\n the mechanism in the brain\\n that worked those miracles had\\n taken an incredible amount of\\n study and finding a means of\\n bringing it under control had\\n taken even longer.\\nNow they did it with dozens of\\n mechanical aids in addition to\\n the hypnotic instructions—and\\n did it usually in a single sitting,\\n with the full transformation of\\n the body taking less than a week\\n after the treatment!\\nBut with all the equipment, it\\n wasn’t impossible for a mistake\\n to happen. It had been no fault of\\n his ... he was sure of that ... his\\n mind was easy to reach ... he\\n could relax so easily....\\nHe came out of it without\\n even a headache, while they were\\n removing the probes, but the\\n fatigue on the operator’s face told\\n him it had been a long and difficult\\n job. He stretched experimentally,\\n with the eternal unconscious\\n expectation that he would\\n find himself suddenly young\\n again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.\\n It took days for the mind\\n to work on all the cells and to\\n repair the damage of time.\\nCOBB LED him back to the\\n first office, where he was given\\n an injection of some kind and\\n another sample of his blood was\\n taken, while the earlier tests were\\n repeated. But finally the doctor\\n nodded.\\n“That’s all for now, Mr. Giles.\\n You might drop in tomorrow\\n morning, after I’ve had a chance\\n to complete my study of all this.\\n We’ll know by then whether you’ll\\n need more treatment. Ten o’clock\\n okay?”\\n“But I’ll be all right?”\\nCobb smiled the automatic reassurance\\n of his profession. “We\\n haven’t lost a patient in two hundred\\n years, to my knowledge.”\\n“Thanks,” said Giles. “Ten\\n o’clock is fine.”\\nDubbins was still waiting, reading\\n a paper whose headlined feature\\n carried a glowing account of\\n the discovery of the super-light\\n missile and what it might mean.\\n He took a quick look at Giles and\\n pointed to it. “Great work, Mr.\\n Giles. Maybe we’ll all get to see\\n some of those other worlds yet.”\\n Then he studied Giles more carefully.\\n “Everything’s in good shape\\n now, sir?”\\n“The doctor says everything’s\\n going to be fine,” Giles answered.\\nIt was then he realized for the\\n first time that Cobb had said no\\n such thing. A statement that\\n lightning had never struck a\\n house was no guarantee that it\\n never would. It was an evasion\\n meant to give such an impression.\\nThe worry nagged at him all\\n the way back. Word had already\\n gone around the club that he’d\\n had some kind of attack and\\n there were endless questions that\\n kept it on his mind. And even\\n when it had been covered and\\n recovered, he could still sense the\\n glances of the others, as if he\\n were Vincenti in one of the man’s\\n more morose moods.\\nHe found a single table in the\\n dining room and picked his way\\n through the meal, listening to\\n the conversation about him only\\n when it was necessary because\\n someone called across to him.\\n Ordinarily, he was quick to support\\n the idea of clubs in place\\n of private families. A man here\\n could choose his group and grow\\n into them. Yet he wasn’t swallowed\\n by them, as he might be by\\n a family. Giles had been living\\n here for nearly a century now and\\n he’d never regretted it. But tonight\\n his own group irritated him.\\nHe puzzled over it, finding no\\n real reason. Certainly they weren’t\\n forcing themselves on him. He\\n remembered once when he’d had\\n a cold, before they finally licked\\n that; Harry had been a complete\\n nuisance, running around with\\n various nostrums, giving him no\\n peace. Constant questions about\\n how he felt, constant little looks\\n of worry—until he’d been ready\\n to yell at the boy. In fact, he\\n had.\\nFunny, he couldn’t picture really\\n losing his temper here. Families\\n did odd things to a man.\\nHE LISTENED to a few of\\n the discussions after the dinner,\\n but he’d heard them all before,\\n except for one about the\\n super-speed drive, and there he\\n had no wish to talk until he could\\n study the final report. He gave up\\n at last and went to his own suite.\\n What he needed was a good\\n night’s sleep after a little relaxation.\\nEven that failed him, though.\\n He’d developed one of the finest\\n chess collections in the world, but\\n tonight it held no interest. And\\n when he drew out his tools and\\n tried working on the delicate,\\n lovely jade for the set he was\\n carving his hands seemed to be\\n all thumbs. None of the other interests\\n he’d developed through\\n the years helped to add to the\\n richness of living now.\\nHe gave it up and went to bed—to\\n have the fragment of that\\n song pop into his head. Now there\\n was no escaping it. Something\\n about the years—or was it days—dwindling\\n down to something\\n or other.\\nCould they really dwindle\\n down? Suppose he couldn’t rejuvenate\\n all the way? He knew\\n that there were some people who\\n didn’t respond as well as others.\\n Sol Graves, for instance. He’d\\n been fifty when he finally learned\\n how to work with the doctors and\\n they could only bring him back to\\n about thirty, instead of the normal\\n early twenties. Would that\\n reduce the slice of eternity that\\n rejuvenation meant? And what\\n had happened to Sol?\\nOr suppose it wasn’t rejuvenation,\\n after all; suppose something\\n had gone wrong with him\\n permanently?\\nHe fought that off, but he\\n couldn’t escape the nagging\\n doubts at the doctor’s words.\\nHe got up once to stare at himself\\n in the mirror. Ten hours had\\n gone by and there should have\\n been some signs of improvement.\\n He couldn’t be sure, though,\\n whether there were or not.\\nHe looked no better the next\\n morning when he finally dragged\\n himself up from the little sleep\\n he’d managed to get. The hollows\\n were still there and the circles\\n under his eyes. He searched for\\n the gray in his hair, but the traitorous\\n strands had been removed\\n at the doctor’s office and he could\\n find no new ones.\\nHe looked into the dining room\\n and then went by hastily. He\\n wanted no solicitous glances this\\n morning. Drat it, maybe he\\n should move out. Maybe trying\\n family life again would give him\\n some new interests. Amanda probably\\n would be willing to marry\\n him; she’d hinted at a date once.\\nHe stopped, shocked by the\\n awareness that he hadn’t been out\\n with a woman for....\\nHe couldn’t remember how\\n long it had been. Nor why.\\n“In the spring, a young man’s\\n fancy,” he quoted to himself, and\\n then shuddered.\\nIt hadn’t been that kind of\\n spring for him—not this rejuvenation\\n nor the last, nor the one\\n before that.\\nGILES TRIED to stop scaring\\n himself and partially succeeded,\\n until he reached the doctor’s\\n office. Then it was no longer necessary\\n to frighten himself. The\\n wrongness was too strong, no matter\\n how professional Cobb’s smile!\\nHe didn’t hear the preliminary\\n words. He watched the smile vanish\\n as the stack of reports came\\n out. There was no nurse here\\n now. The machines were quiet—and\\n all the doors were shut.\\nGiles shook his head, interrupting\\n the doctor’s technical jargon.\\n Now that he knew there was reason\\n for his fear, it seemed to\\n vanish, leaving a coldness that\\n numbed him.\\n“I’d rather know the whole\\n truth,” he said. His voice sounded\\n dead in his ears. “The worst first.\\n The rejuvenation...?”\\nCobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.\\n “Failed.” He stopped, and\\n his hands touched the reports on\\n his desk. “Completely,” he added\\n in a low, defeated tone.\\n“But I thought that was impossible!”\\n“So did I. I wouldn’t believe\\n it even yet—but now I find it\\n isn’t the first case. I spent the\\n night at Medical Center going up\\n the ranks until I found men who\\n really know about it. And now I\\n wish I hadn’t.” His voice ran\\n down and he gathered himself together\\n by an effort. “It’s a shock\\n to me, too, Mr. Giles. But—well,\\n to simplify it, no memory is perfect—even\\n cellular memory. It\\n loses a little each time. And the\\n effect is cumulative. It’s like an\\n asymptotic curve—the further it\\n goes, the steeper the curve. And—well,\\n you’ve passed too far.”\\nHe faced away from Giles,\\n dropping the reports into a\\n drawer and locking it. “I wasn’t\\n supposed to tell you, of course.\\n It’s going to be tough enough\\n when they’re ready to let people\\n know. But you aren’t the first and\\n you won’t be the last, if that’s any\\n consolation. We’ve got a longer\\n time scale than we used to have—but\\n it’s in centuries, not in\\n eons. For everybody, not just\\n you.”\\nIt was no consolation. Giles\\n nodded mechanically. “I won’t\\n talk, of course. How—how long?”\\nCobb spread his hands unhappily.\\n “Thirty years, maybe. But\\n we can make them better. Geriatric\\n knowledge is still on record.\\n We can fix the heart and all the\\n rest. You’ll be in good physical\\n condition, better than your grandfather—”\\n“And then....” Giles couldn’t\\n pronounce the words. He’d grown\\n old and he’d grow older. And\\n eventually he’d die!\\nAn immortal man had suddenly\\n found death hovering on his\\n trail. The years had dwindled and\\n gone, and only a few were left.\\nHe stood up, holding out his\\n hand. “Thank you, Doctor,” he\\n said, and was surprised to find\\n he meant it. The man had done\\n all he could and had at least\\n saved him the suspense of growing\\n doubt and horrible eventual\\n discovery.\\nOUTSIDE ON the street, he\\n looked up at the Sun and\\n then at the buildings built to last\\n for thousands of years. Their\\n eternity was no longer a part of\\n him.\\nEven his car would outlast him.\\nHe climbed into it, still partly\\n numbed, and began driving mechanically,\\n no longer wondering\\n about the dangers that might possibly\\n arise. Those wouldn’t matter\\n much now. For a man who\\n had thought of living almost forever,\\n thirty years was too short\\n a time to count.\\nHe was passing near the club\\n and started to slow. Then he\\n went on without stopping. He\\n wanted no chance to have them\\n asking questions he couldn’t answer.\\n It was none of their business.\\n Dubbins had been kind—but\\n now Giles wanted no kindness.\\nThe street led to the office\\n and he drove on. What else was\\n there for him? There, at least, he\\n could still fill his time with work—work\\n that might even be useful.\\n In the future, men would\\n need the super-light drive if they\\n were to span much more of the\\n Universe than now. And he could\\n speed up the work in some ways\\n still, even if he could never see\\n its finish.\\nIt would be cold comfort but it\\n was something. And he might\\n keep busy enough to forget sometimes\\n that the years were gone\\n for him.\\nAutomatic habit carried him\\n through the office again, to Amanda’s\\n desk, where her worry was\\n still riding her. He managed a\\n grin and somehow the right words\\n came to his lips. “I saw the doctor,\\n Amanda, so you can stop\\n figuring ways to get me there.”\\nShe smiled back suddenly, without\\n feigning it. “Then you’re all\\n right?”\\n“As all right as I’ll ever be,”\\n he told her. “They tell me I’m just\\n growing old.”\\nThis time her laugh was heartier.\\n He caught himself before he\\n could echo her mirth in a different\\n voice and went inside where she\\n had the coffee waiting for him.\\nOddly, it still tasted good to\\n him.\\nThe projection was off, he saw,\\n wondering whether he’d left it on\\n or not. He snapped the switch and\\n saw the screen light up, with the\\n people still in the odd, wheelless\\n vehicle on the alien planet.\\nFOR A long moment, he stared\\n at the picture without thinking,\\n and then bent closer. Harry’s\\n face hadn’t changed much. Giles\\n had almost forgotten it, but there\\n was still the same grin there. And\\n his grandchildren had a touch\\n of it, too. And of their grandfather’s\\n nose, he thought. Funny,\\n he’d never seen even pictures of\\n his other grandchildren. Family\\n ties melted away too fast for interstellar\\n travel.\\nYet there seemed to be no\\n slackening of them in Harry’s\\n case, and somehow it looked like\\n a family, rather than a mere\\n group. A very pleasant family in\\n a very pleasant world.\\nHe read Harry’s note again,\\n with its praise for the planet and\\n its invitation. He wondered if\\n Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation\\n like that, before he left.\\n Or had he even been one of those\\n to whom the same report had\\n been delivered by some doctor?\\n It didn’t matter, but it would explain\\n things, at least.\\nTwenty years to Centaurus,\\n while the years dwindled down—\\nThen abruptly the line finished\\n itself. “The years dwindle down\\n to a precious few....” he remembered.\\n “A precious few.”\\nThose dwindling years had\\n been precious once. He unexpectedly\\n recalled his own grandfather\\n holding him on an old\\n knee and slipping him candy\\n that was forbidden. The years\\n seemed precious to the old man\\n then.\\nAmanda’s voice came abruptly\\n over the intercom. “Jordan wants\\n to talk to you,” she said, and the\\n irritation was sharp in her voice.\\n “He won’t take no!”\\nGiles shrugged and reached for\\n the projector, to cut it off. Then,\\n on impulse, he set it back to the\\n picture, studying the group again\\n as he switched on Jordan’s wire.\\nBut he didn’t wait for the hot\\n words about whatever was the\\n trouble.\\n“Bill,” he said, “start getting\\n the big ship into production. I’ve\\n found a volunteer.”\\nHe’d been driven to it, he knew,\\n as he watched the man’s amazed\\n face snap from the screen. From\\n the first suspicion of his trouble,\\n something inside him had been\\n forcing him to make this decision.\\n And maybe it would do no good.\\n Maybe the ship would fail. But\\n thirty years was a number a man\\n could risk.\\nIf he made it, though....\\nWell, he’d see those grandchildren\\n of his this year—and\\n Harry. Maybe he’d even tell\\n Harry the truth, once they got\\n done celebrating the reunion. And\\n there’d be other grandchildren.\\n With the ship, he’d have time\\n enough to look them up. Plenty\\n of time!\\nThirty years was a long time,\\n when he stopped to think of it.\\n—LESTER DEL REY\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

I had to get in touch with\\n somebody about this because if there is something to it, then somebody,\\n everybody, is going to point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, \"Why\\n didn\\'t you warn us?\"\\n\\n\\n I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to\\n me because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums. Also they\\n might think I was on booze, too, or maybe the hops, and get my license\\n revoked. I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests\\n might be down on their luck now and then.\\n\\n\\n What really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of\\n two of my guests. They both took a powder last Wednesday morning.\\n\\n\\n Now get this. In one room, that of Joe Binkle, which maybe is an alias,\\n I find nothing but a suit of clothes, some butts and the letters I\\n include here in same package. Binkle had only one suit. That I know.\\n And this was it laying right in the middle of the room. Inside the\\n coat was the vest, inside the vest the shirt, inside the shirt the\\n underwear. The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also\\n the underwear. All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of\\n it and dripped through a crack in the floor. In a bureau drawer were\\n the letters I told you about.\\n\\n\\n Now. In the room right under Binkle\\'s lived another stew bum that\\n checked in Thursday ... name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. This guy was a\\n real case. He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame.\\n Airloom, he says. He pays a week in advance, staggers up the stairs to\\n his room with the mirror and that\\'s the last I see of him.\\n\\n\\n In Smith\\'s room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes, the same\\n suit he wore when he came in. In the coat the vest, in the vest the\\n shirt, in the shirt the underwear. Also in the pants. Also all in the\\n middle of the floor. Against the far wall stands the frame of the\\n mirror. Only the frame!\\n\\n\\n What a spot to be in! Now it might have been a gag. Sometimes these\\n guys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff. But then I read\\n the letters. This knocks me for a loop. They are all in different\\n handwritings. All from different places. Stamps all legit, my kid says.\\n India, China, England, everywhere.\\n\\n\\n My kid, he reads. He says it\\'s no joke. He wants to call the cops or\\n maybe some doctor. But I say no. He reads your magazine so he says\\n write to you, send you the letters. You know what to do. Now you have\\n them. Maybe you print. Whatever you do, Mr. Editor, remember my place,\\n the Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don\\'t drink. I never\\n touch junk, not even aspirin.\\nYours very truly,\\n\\n Ivan Smernda\\nBombay, India\\n\\n June 8\\n\\n\\n Mr. Joe Binkle\\n\\n Plaza Ritz Arms\\n\\n New York City\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n Greetings, greetings, greetings. Hold firm in your wretched projection,\\n for tomorrow you will not be alone in the not-world. In two days I,\\n Glmpauszn, will be born.\\n\\n\\n Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirror\\n gateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such\\n tremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus\\n within the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am static\\n and for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe\\n with fear and trepidation.\\n\\n\\n As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got\\n no response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate\\n wave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and\\n returning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing\\n and surrounded with an impregnable chimera.\\n\\n\\n Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the\\n not-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what\\n the not-world calls \"mail\" till we meet. For this purpose I must\\n utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose\\n inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.\\n Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.\\n\\n\\n I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary\\n reports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury\\n of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free\\n of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in\\n your task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we\\n return again.\\n\\n\\n The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of\\n Bombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.\\n Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact\\n location, for the not-people might have access to the information.\\n\\n\\n I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it\\n is alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from\\n the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational\\n likeness.\\n\\n\\n I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among\\n them. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway\\n lies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in\\n order that I might destroy the not-people completely.\\n\\n\\n All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too\\n fast. I\\'m having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.\\n Gezsltrysk, what a task!\\n\\n\\n Farewell till later.\\nGlmpauszn\\nWichita, Kansas\\n\\n June 13\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you,\\n I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are\\n no terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in\\n not-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my\\n birth.\\n\\n\\n Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited\\n equipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor\\n came in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation\\n reigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What\\n difference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.\\n As they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,\\n since I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mGezsltrysk!\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up\\n their hands and left.\\n\\n\\n I learned the following day that the opposite component of my\\n not-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance\\n during my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a\\n bender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.\\n\\n\\n When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I\\n made a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36\\n not-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was\\n standing by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.\\n He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of\\n speech.\\n\\n\\n Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I\\n produced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.\\n\\n\\n \"Poppa,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that\\n are now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded\\n low-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have\\n jarred on my not-father\\'s ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the\\n room.\\n\\n\\n They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something\\n about my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at\\n the doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,\\n she fell down heavily. She made a distinct\\nthump\\non the floor.\\n\\n\\n This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window\\n and retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,\\n but I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!\\n\\n\\n I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the\\n cleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply\\n from Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise\\n indeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.\\n But you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself\\n and it\\'s his nature never to flatter anyone.\\n\\n\\n From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the\\n qualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this\\n alleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive\\n mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people\\n refer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we\\n learned otherwise, while they never have.\\n\\n\\n New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard\\n time classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the\\n inevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of\\n the not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand your\\n not replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What could\\n have happened to your vibrations?\\nGlmpauszn\\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\\n\\n June 15\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n I had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time.\\n My process—original with myself, by the way—is to send out feeler\\n vibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I\\n establish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his\\n knowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my\\n letter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he\\n has done.\\n\\n\\n My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an\\n individual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but\\n I fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell\\n you about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have\\n accomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.\\n\\n\\n In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of\\n sleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz &amp; uhrytzg ... no, it won\\'t come out.\\n Anyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.\\n\\n\\n As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ...\\n my brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard\\n time classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire\\n the stuff needed for the destruction of these people.\\n\\n\\n Sunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the\\n impressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning\\n for me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient\\n mechanism I inhabit.\\n\\n\\n I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions.\\n It was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried\\n immediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up\\n and all about me at the beauty.\\n\\n\\n Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I\\n simply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was\\n to realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not\\n let yourself believe they do.\\n\\n\\n This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here.\\n Her hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She\\n wore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was\\n diverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.\\n\\n\\n The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from\\n nearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with\\n an attitude of mild interest. They weren\\'t interested in me, I told\\n myself. But they were.\\n\\n\\n I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you\\n unfortunately do not have—invisibility. I lay there and listened.\\n\\n\\n \"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.\\n\\n\\n A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.\\n\\n\\n \"Lizzy, you\\'ll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of\\n this area.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n \"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,\" the officer ordered. \"No more speeches\\n in the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now\\n where is your naked friend? I\\'m going to make an example of him.\"\\n\\n\\n That was it—I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this\\n oversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions\\n that assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty,\\n pain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don\\'t know one from the other. I\\n must feel each, become accustomed to it.\\n\\n\\n The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I\\n have been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe.\\n What will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is\\n impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write\\n you with more enlightenment.\\nGlmpauszn\\nMoscow, Idaho\\n\\n June 17\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greet\\n me in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,\\n pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five\\n bucks!\\n\\n\\n It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with\\n the correct variant of the slang term \"buck.\" Is it possible that you\\n are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in\\n this inferior world?\\n\\n\\n A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in\\n a struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions\\n of this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived\\n a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world\\n ripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual\\n fluctuations make up our sentient population.\\n\\n\\n Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized\\n by these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets\\n as you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the\\n greatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides\\n are joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational\\n plane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world\\n of higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.\\n While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,\\n more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.\\n\\n\\n They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves\\n into ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force\\n some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,\\n causing them much agony and fright.\\n\\n\\n The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call\\n mediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one\\n of them at the first opportunity to see for myself.\\n\\n\\n Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked\\n them up while examining the \"slang\" portion of my information catalog\\n which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate\\n cause—in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace\\n of our world—shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,\\n get hep.\\n\\n\\n As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.\\nGlmpauszn\\nDes Moines, Iowa\\n\\n June 19\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages\\n in my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.\\n Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here\\n \"revolting\" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are\\n all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most\\n important part of my journey—completion of the weapon against the\\n not-worlders—I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that\\n day, I assure you.\\nGlmpauszn\\nBoise, Idaho\\n\\n July 15\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n A great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last.\\n Systematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in\\n our catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed\\n bending before the winds of passion. In fact, I\\'m rather badly bent\\n indeed. Ah! You\\'ll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known\\n quaintly in this tongue as a \"hooker of red-eye.\" Ha! I\\'ve mastered\\n even the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me\\n again. I feel much better now.\\n\\n\\n You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that\\n constantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to\\n react exactly as our information catalog instructed me to.\\n\\n\\n Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am\\n burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,\\n I experience a tickle.\\n\\n\\n This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group\\n of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me\\n again. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely\\n enough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world\\n came most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing\\n here, both among those who haven\\'t got it and those who have.\\n\\n\\n I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and\\n carried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money\\n to a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best\\n hotel here in—no, sorry—and stared at it for hours.\\n\\n\\n Nothing happened. I didn\\'t love the stuff or feel one way or the other\\n about it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for\\n the love of it.\\n\\n\\n Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or\\n fifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare\\n rooms filled with money. If I don\\'t love it then, I\\'ll feel I have\\n failed. This alcohol is taking effect now.\\n\\n\\n Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports!\\n I\\'ve got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I\\'ve been\\n studying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of\\n these people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these\\n people as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there\\n do homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.\\n\\n\\n Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.\\n\\n\\n By the way, Joe, I\\'m forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won\\'t\\n cost me anything. It\\'ll come out of the pocket of the idiot who\\'s\\n writing this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?\\n\\n\\n I\\'m going out and look at that money again. I think I\\'m at last\\n learning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, one\\n simply must persevere, I always say.\\nGlmpauszn\\nPenobscot, Maine\\n\\n July 20\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it\\n in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across\\n to this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a\\n quart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel\\n wonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.\\n\\n\\n There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this\\n body and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now\\n I can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today\\n outlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must\\n finally defeat these people. Of course, I haven\\'t made the experiments\\n yet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of\\n the inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn\\'t know won\\'t muss his\\n vibrations.\\n\\n\\n I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a\\n blonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was\\n attracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is\\n perfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember\\n distinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I\\n had dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.\\n We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you\\n believe it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the\\n money in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\\n\\n\\n Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve\\n ends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these\\n impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the\\n adrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the\\n entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\\n\\n\\n I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the\\n tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself\\n quickly.\\n\\n\\n Now in all the motion pictures—true representations of life and love\\n in this world—the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl\\n and tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.\\n This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,\\n wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would\\n have a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?\\n\\n\\n I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.\\n Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I\\n had not found love.\\n\\n\\n I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell\\n asleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin\\n and didn\\'t even notice when the blonde girl left.\\n\\n\\n I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don\\'t\\n I wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?\\n I\\'d get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a\\n gin mixture.\\n\\n\\n I think I\\'ll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It\\'ll\\n take him a gleeb to figure this one out. I\\'ll tell him I\\'m setting up\\n an atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do\\n is activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.\\n\\n\\n Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It\\'s just a vacation. Joe,\\n you old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off the\\n fat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.\\nGlmpauszn\\nSacramento, Calif.\\n\\n July 25\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n All is lost unless we work swiftly. I received your revealing letter\\n the morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a\\n lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance\\n things.\\n\\n\\n Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got\\n to the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and\\n continued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again\\n because she said yes immediately.\\n\\n\\n The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the\\n most frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these\\n people really are to our world.\\n\\n\\n The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong\\n psychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I\\n was too busy with the redhead to notice.\\n\\n\\n Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal\\n grandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He\\n concentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in\\n the room. The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white,\\n shapeless cascade of light.\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, \"Grandma Lucy!\" Then I\\n really took notice.\\n\\n\\n Grandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury\\n partially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in\\n the fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku\\n was open and his btgrimms were down.\\n\\n\\n Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable\\n pattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the\\n redhead.\\n\\n\\n Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a\\n result of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these\\n not-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality\\n of not-reality. It\\'s true. I cannot do without it now. The day is only\\n half over and I have consumed a quart and a half. And it is dulling all\\n my powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can\\'t even become\\n invisible any more.\\n\\n\\n I must find the formula that will wipe out the not-world men quickly.\\n\\n\\n Quickly!\\nGlmpauszn\\nFlorence, Italy\\n\\n September 10\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time. I must pick\\n closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but\\n failure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula\\n that is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were\\n filled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\\n\\n\\n I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\\n realized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\\n that inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\\n immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\\n aware of the nature of my activities.\\n\\n\\n I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\\n stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\\n into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\\n I was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\\n customer.\\n\\n\\n \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\\n\\n\\n I was baffled. What could I tell him?\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn\\'t the service good?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s the rooms,\" I told him. \"They\\'re—they\\'re—\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re what?\" he wanted to know.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re not safe.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\\n\\n\\n At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\\n\\n\\n \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\\n\\n\\n He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\\n Another day, another hotel. I swear I\\'m even beginning to think like\\n the not-men, curse them.\\nGlmpauszn\\nRochester, New York\\n\\n September 25\\n\\n\\n Dear Joe:\\n\\n\\n I have it! It is done! In spite of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury\\'s\\n niggling criticism, I have succeeded. I now have developed a form\\n of mold, somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world, that,\\n transmitted to the human organism, will cause a disease whose end will\\n be swift and fatal.\\n\\n\\n First the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart.\\n Nothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose.\\n Absolutely nothing.\\n\\n\\n We must use care. Stock in as much gin as you are able. I will bring\\n with me all that I can. Meanwhile I must return to my original place of\\n birth into this world of horrors. There I will secure the gateway, a\\n large mirror, the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowly\\n climb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful, now secure\\n world. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators.\\n\\n\\n You say you eat little and drink as much as you can. The same with\\n me. Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight. My not-world senses\\n falter. This is the last letter. Tomorrow I come with the gateway. When\\n the gin is gone, we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live.\\n\\n\\n In only a single gleeb it will begin to work. The men of this queer\\n world will be no more. But we can\\'t say we didn\\'t have some fun, can\\n we, Joe?\\n\\n\\n And just let Blgftury make one crack. Just one xyzprlt. I\\'ll have\\n hgutry before the ghjdksla!\\nGlmpauszn\\nDear Editor:\\n\\n\\n These guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not? If soon brain\\n dissolve, body fall apart, how long have we got? Please, anybody who\\n knows answer, write to me—Ivan Smernda, Plaza Ritz Arms—how long is a\\n gleeb?\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

I let myself into the apartment, which\\n had an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown\\n temperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but\\n according to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got\\n dressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my\\n wife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.\\n\\n\\n What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I\\'ve vacuumed\\n the carpet, I\\'ve dusted and I\\'ve straightened the cushions.... Ah! The\\n ashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the\\n place looked wife-deserted.\\n\\n\\n It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I\\'d\\n had to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I\\n write for. I didn\\'t notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella\\n when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost\\n tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a\\n woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.\\n\\n\\n \"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go\\n on grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac.\\n You\\'ll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\"\\n\\n\\n If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over\\n my hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held\\n me up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,\\n just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one\\n which exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing\\n happened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain\\n had stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.\\nAs I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where\\n they were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the\\n usual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular,\\n a man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay.\\n While I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was\\n able to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size\\n of an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight,\\n and then his chattering drill hit it.\\n\\n\\n There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on\\n his back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the\\n moment of the explosion—if so feeble a thing can be called one—I\\n felt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my\\n hand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the\\n bleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some\\n pink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I\\n found that I had missed the story conference.\\n\\n\\n During the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase \"I\\'m just\\n spitballing\" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite,\\n \"The whole ball of wax,\" twelve times. However, my story had been\\n accepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the\\n conference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World,\\n the Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which\\n rung of the ladder you have achieved.\\n\\n\\n The subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the\\n apartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing\\n there talking to the doorman.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it\\n at your office building.\" I looked blank and he explained, \"We just\\n heard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed\\n at the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it.\"\\n\\n\\n Anything can happen in advertising, I thought. \"That\\'s right, Danny, I\\n just missed it,\" I said, and went on in.\\n\\n\\n Psychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the\\n other hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and\\n except for the alarm clock, I\\'d had no control over what had been going\\n on.\\n\\n\\n I went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the\\n directions Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until\\n she got back from her mother\\'s in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days.\\n How to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and\\n such. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced\\n that I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the\\n reasons she supposes.\\n\\n\\n I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: \"When\\n you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door,\\n too.\"\\n\\n\\n Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in\\n front of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate\\n me from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.\\n When I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the\\n manuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The\\n pencil was standing on its end.\\nThere, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear\\n about, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank\\n some of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the\\n muggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter\\n to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last\\n sentence.\\n\\n\\n Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.\\n My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly\\'s\\n notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed\\n one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: \"Garbage\\n picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I\\n love you.\" What can you do when the girl loves you?\\n\\n\\n I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window\\n at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was\\n exercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be\\n allowed to perch, but were not allowed to.\\n\\n\\n Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that\\n their wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking\\n about this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn,\\n they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all\\n wanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and\\n fell.\\n\\n\\n The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and\\n picked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,\\n stroking its feathers.\\n\\n\\n My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were\\n interrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is\\n usually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like\\n an incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that\\n of my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has\\n never, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late\\n afternoon.\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t say a thing like that to me!\" I heard him shout. \"I tell you\\n I got that deck this afternoon and they weren\\'t opened till we started\\n to play!\"\\n\\n\\n Several other loud voices started at the same time.\\n\\n\\n \"Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, and only when you were dealer!\"\\n\\n\\n The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the\\n door to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting\\n him, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the\\n impulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he\\n looked stunned.\\n\\n\\n \"Here!\" he said, holding out a deck of cards, \"For Pete\\'s sake, look at\\n \\'em yourselves if you think they\\'re marked!\"\\n\\n\\n The nearest man struck them up from his hand. \"Okay, Houdini! So\\n they\\'re not marked! All I know is five straight....\"\\n\\n\\n His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards\\n on the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the\\n rest face up—all red.\\nSomeone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and\\n the four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence,\\n got in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly\\n arranged cards.\\n\\n\\n \"Judas!\" he said, and started to pick them up. \"Will you look at that!\\n My God, what a session....\"\\n\\n\\n I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it,\\n but I had an idea what I would hear.\\n\\n\\n After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.\\n\\n\\n \"Never seen anything to equal it,\" he said. \"Wouldn\\'t have believed\\n it. Those guys\\ndidn\\'t\\nbelieve it. Every round normal, nothing\\n unusual about the hands—three of a kind, a low straight, that sort\\n of thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be\\nmy\\ndeal. Brother! Straight flush to the king—every time! And each time,\\n somebody else has four aces....\"\\n\\n\\n He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There\\n was one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top\\n broke and glass chips got into the bottle.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll have to go down for more soda,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll come, too. I need air.\"\\n\\n\\n At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in\\n what must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the\\n top of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the\\n tile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from\\n at least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and\\n I was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth\\n open and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his\\n mouth open.\\nOn the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie\\n his shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi\\n swerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded,\\n its rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign\\n cars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any\\n side-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to\\n rest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that\\n moment.\\n\\n\\n The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and\\n the taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged\\n crosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either\\n forward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi\\n to a lamp.\\n\\n\\n Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at\\n all, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues.\\n Everyone was honking his horn.\\n\\n\\n Danny was furious—more so when he tried to put through a call to his\\n station house from the box opposite.\\n\\n\\n It was out of order.\\nUpstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the\\n windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had\\n brightened up considerably.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll stay for one more drink and then I\\'m due at the office,\" he said.\\n \"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned\\n and nodded toward the pandemonium.\\n\\n\\n When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk\\n lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except\\n one. That was tied in three knots.\\n\\n\\n All\\nright\\n, I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had\\n come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call\\n McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university\\n uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he\\n knows everything.\\n\\n\\n When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,\\nmore\\ntrouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill\\'s\\n voice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were\\n connected. That\\'s a damn funny coincidence.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I\\'ve got something for\\n you to work on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Molly\\'s away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It\\'s urgent.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\\n\\n\\n While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of\\n my novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a\\n point where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it\\n was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\\n \"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to\\n the side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\\n\\n\\n This was absolutely not my day.\\n\"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you\\'ve told me is impossible or\\n supernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against\\n that poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him.\\n It\\'s all those other things....\"\\n\\n\\n He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight\\n while I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\\n\\n\\n \"Alec, you\\'re a reasonable guy, so I don\\'t think you\\'ll take offense at\\n what I\\'m going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely,\\n and the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that\\n you\\'re either stringing me or you\\'re subject to a delusion.\" I started\\n to get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don\\'t\\n you see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook\\n his head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a\\n demonstration.\"\\n\\n\\n He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any\\n change on you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There\\n must have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think\\n they\\'ll each have the same date, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did you accumulate all that change today?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. During the week.\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you\\n could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that\\n would be\\nactually\\nimpossible. It would involve time-reversal. I\\'ll\\n tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let\\'s see if\\n they all come up heads.\"\\n\\n\\n I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the\\n floor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked\\n themselves into a neat pile.\\n\\n\\n I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a\\n handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\\n\\n\\n These coins didn\\'t stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,\\n the adjacent ones touching.\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that\\n there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\\n Universe—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example\\n of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions\\n of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so\\n many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of\\n Thermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn\\'t theoretically hard-and-fast;\\n it\\'s just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other\\n hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes\\n against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental\\n manifestation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is\\n controlling the coins and—the other things?\"\\nHe shook his head. \"No. All I mean is that improbable things usually\\n have improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,\\n I don\\'t say to myself, \\'Here\\'s a miracle.\\' I revise my version of the\\n book of rules. Something—I don\\'t know what—is going on, and it seems\\n to involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you\\n still in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hm. You\\'re the center, all right. But why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an\\n electrical storm. Something has it in for me!\"\\n\\n\\n McGill grinned. \"Don\\'t be superstitious. And especially don\\'t be\\n anthropomorphic.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if it\\'s the opposite of random, it\\'s got to be a form of life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are\\n being rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it\\'s a\\n non-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder.\" He had a faraway,\\n frowning look.\\n\\n\\n I was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go out and eat,\" I said, \"There\\'s not a damn thing in the\\n kitchen and I\\'m not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee.\"\\n\\n\\n We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we\\n could hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were,\\n by this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we\\n heard one of them say to Danny, \"I don\\'t know what the hell\\'s going\\n on around here. Every goddam car\\'s got something the matter with it.\\n They can\\'t none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen\\n anything like it.\"\\n\\n\\n Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they\\n tried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let\\n the other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had\\n embarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were\\n replaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,\\n only to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches\\n which met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts\\n ever witnessed—a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything\\n else, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical\\n excuses and threats.\\nDanny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right,\\n Mr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t know what\\'s going on around here, but\\n ever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\"\\n he shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over\\n here!\"\\n\\n\\n Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas\\n intertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over\\n fenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the\\n ladies seemed not to be.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my\\n umbrella and we\\'ll say no more about it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And so now it\\'s Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\\n\\n\\n The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also\\n caught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the\\n other two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,\\n but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was\\n Molly. My nurse-wife.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all\\n right?\" Was\\nI\\nall right!\\n\\n\\n \"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn\\'t know what to\\n think.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course I\\'m all right. But why....\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother\\'s\\n number and there wasn\\'t anyone on the line, so then she had it traced\\n and it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a\\n busy signal. Oh, dear, are you\\nsure\\nyou\\'re all right?\"\\n\\n\\n I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.\\n Then I caught Danny\\'s eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast\\n to it.\\n\\n\\n \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\\n\\n\\n When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\\n \"And incidentally to me. I\\'m not properly briefed yet.\"\\n\\n\\n He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was\\n a jump ahead of him.\\n\\n\\n \"In other words, you think it\\'s something organic?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" McGill said, \"I\\'m trying to think of anything else it might be.\\n I\\'m not doing so well,\" he confessed.\\n\\n\\n \"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it\\'s mere probability, and\\n without any over-all pattern.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\"\\nMolly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you\\nfeel\\nall right, darling?\" she asked me. I nodded brightly. \"You\\'ll\\n think this silly of me,\" she went on to McGill, \"but why isn\\'t it\\n something like an overactive poltergeist?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pure concept,\" he said. \"No genuine evidence.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Magnetism?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren\\'t\\n magnetic—and don\\'t forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,\\n and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has\\n mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,\\n all you\\'d get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of\\n iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay\\n there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than\\n that—they go on moving.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it\\n has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that\\'s all. I\\'ll agree\\n this—thing—has no discernible shape and motion\\nis\\ninvolved, but\\n plants don\\'t move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but\\n it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a\\n non-random pattern. In this case, it\\'s rearranging random motions and\\n it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing—at least in what you might\\n call improbability.\"\\n\\n\\n Molly frowned. \"Then what\\nis\\nit? What\\'s it made of?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I should say it was made of the motions. There\\'s a similar idea about\\n the atom. Another thing that\\'s like a crystal is that it appears to\\n be forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck\\n of sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of\\n crystallization.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an\\n impertinent look.\\n\\n\\n \"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn\\'t have the same\\n date? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because I don\\'t think this thing got going before today and\\n everything that\\'s happened can all be described as improbable motions\\n here and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would\\n require retroactive action, reversing time. That\\'s out, in my book.\\n That telephone now—\"\\n\\n\\n The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone\\n repairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister,\" he said with strong\\n disapproval.\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly not,\" I said. \"Is it broken?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not exactly\\nbroken\\n, but—\" He shook his head and took it apart some\\n more.\\nMcGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally\\n the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried\\n to explain to me what had happened with the phone.\\n\\n\\n \"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the\\n receiver in such a way that the contact wasn\\'t quite open.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But for Pete\\'s sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long\\n time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her\\n nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the\\n floor—something like that—just happened to cause the right induction\\n impulses. Yes, I know how you feel,\" he said, seeing my expression.\\n \"It\\'s beginning to bear down.\"\\n\\n\\n Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was\\n so pleased to see her that I\\'d forgotten all about being hungry.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m in no mood to cook,\" she said. \"Let\\'s get away from all this.\"\\n\\n\\n McGill raised an eyebrow. \"If all this, as you call it, will let us.\"\\n\\n\\n In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve been put on the story—who could be better?—I live here. So far,\\n I don\\'t quite get what\\'s been happening. I\\'ve been talking to Danny,\\n but he didn\\'t say much. I got the feeling he thinks you\\'re involved in\\n some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what\\'s with you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s got a theory,\" said Molly. \"Come and eat with us and he\\'ll tell\\n you all about it.\"\\n\\n\\n Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth\\n Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn\\'t seem to be any less than\\n before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,\\n and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the\\n lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.\\n\\n\\n \"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it\\'s at the\\n station house. What there\\'s left of it, that is.\"\\n\\n\\n Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt\\n the speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of\\n cigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I\\n happened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before\\n I could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the\\n sidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but\\n said nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.\\n\\n\\n When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool—although it\\n didn\\'t stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door\\n and ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the\\n next table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green\\n evening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter\\n returned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold\\n cuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait\\n for the fat lady.\\n\\n\\n I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used\\n instead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and\\n made faces.\\nThe waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to\\n the bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted\\n one of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled\\n expression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a\\n row of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.\\n\\n\\n That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing\\n came out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again.\\n Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his\\n pick, his face pink with exasperation.\\n\\n\\n I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice\\nis\\na\\n crystal, I thought to myself.\\n\\n\\n The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing\\n happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar\\n crowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back,\\n baffled, saying he\\'d have the drinks in a moment, and went to the\\n kitchen. When he returned, he had madame\\'s vichyssoise and some rolls,\\n which he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had\\n grown larger.\\n\\n\\n Molly lit a cigarette and said, \"I suppose this is all part of it,\\n Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here.\"\\n\\n\\n It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter—a background noise\\n had stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of\\n the air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made\\n a gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly\\'s when she tapped her\\n cigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring\\n vichyssoise.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey! What\\'s the idea?\" snarled the sour-looking man.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m terribly sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident. I—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Throwing cigarettes at people!\" the fat lady said.\\n\\n\\n \"I really didn\\'t mean to,\" I began again, getting up. There must have\\n been a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff\\n buttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely\\n set tables, I pulled everything—tablecloth, silver, water glasses,\\n ashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine—onto the floor.\\n\\n\\n The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man\\n licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The\\n owner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us\\n with a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I\\n was outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Personally, he\\n was in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\\n\\n\\n At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\\n dotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\\n Pottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\\n he knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers—Koltan, eldest\\n and Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\\n treasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\\n the rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\\n\\n\\n \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\\n these Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength\\n and our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may\\n come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the\\n fame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\nis\\na damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father\\'s\\n philosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in\\n Lor.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran\\n rather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"\\n\\n\\n By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen,\\n which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting\\n to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\\n very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\\nLubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his\\n own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough\\n for him. He would report when the time was ripe.\\n\\n\\n \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference\\n was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his\\n elders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building\\n that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means\\n of transport.\"\\n\\n\\n Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret\\n conclave of conference. Only the speaker\\'s youth could account for it.\\n The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\\n\\n\\n \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,\\n remember your position in the family.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\\n\\n\\n \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his\\n head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of\\n the clay.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul did not appreciate his father\\'s approval, for it only earned him\\n a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough\\n thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in\\n their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they\\n did.\\n\\n\\n Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought\\n about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way\\n of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could\\n figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of\\n his brothers. That wouldn\\'t take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of\\n course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.\\nBy and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange\\n metal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the\\n city, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of\\n tile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the\\n people to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much\\n too quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to\\n be desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.\\n\\n\\n The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of\\n Zur. It required but the cooperation—an excellent word, that—of all\\n Zurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in\\n effect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered,\\n for it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a\\n whaling for it.\\n\\n\\n There was also some talk going around about agreements made between\\n the Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one\\n thing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a\\n newspaper, was unknown on Zur.\\n\\n\\n Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously,\\n none had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had\\n tried. The anti-Earthmen Faction—in any culture complex, there is\\n always an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor—crowed\\n happily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.\\n\\n\\n Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships\\n arrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was\\n practically acrawl with Earthmen.\\n\\n\\n Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called\\n \"corporations\"—Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The\\n object of the visit was trade.\\n\\n\\n In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian\\n city of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took\\n some time for the news to spread.\\n\\n\\n The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the\\n pottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an\\n aluminum pot at him.\\n\\n\\n \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\\n\\n\\n \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my\\n substance for some fool\\'s product of precious metal? Take it back, I\\n say!\"\\nThe pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no\\n wonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen\\n are selling them everywhere. They\\'re much better than our old clay\\n pots; they\\'re light and easy to handle and they don\\'t break when\\n dropped.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat,\\n being so light?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Earthmen don\\'t cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is\\n a paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have\\n to design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new\\n type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do\\n you need a whole new stove for one little pot?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan\\n will have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are\\n buying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman\\n said so.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go\\n back to cooking with your old ones.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Earthman took them in trade—one reason why the new ones are so\\n cheap. There isn\\'t a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you\\n will have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul\\n stamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would\\n accommodate the terrestrial pots very well.\\n\\n\\n And Koltan put the model into production.\\n\\n\\n \"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It\\n was wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am\\n sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to\\n do well by us.\"\\n\\n\\n The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with\\n the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a\\n million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the\\n hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every\\n land.\\nIn the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth.\\n One was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever\\n dreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of\\n the Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from\\n it in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its\\n scanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by\\n the novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book—a primer in the Lorian\\n language—and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the\\n brothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.\\n\\n\\n Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire—more than enough\\n in value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur—and set up\\n telegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent.\\n Within five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major\\n city on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed\\n the instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business\\n of the House of Masur continued to look up.\\n\\n\\n \"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan,\\n \"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and\\n especially for the House of Masur.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately\\n sorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his\\n unthinkable impertinence.\\n\\n\\n It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their\\n production of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per\\n cent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves\\n greatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but\\n their business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from\\n Earth.\\n\\n\\n About this time, plastic utensils—dishes, cups, knives, forks—made\\n their appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the\\n newfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for\\n everything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade.\\n What they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They\\n destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.\\n\\n\\n The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of\\n Masur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.\\nTrembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan\\n called an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his\\n senile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man\\n might still have a little wit left that could be helpful.\\n\\n\\n \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine\\n our business,\" and he read off the figures.\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before,\\n and will result in something even better for us.\"\\n\\n\\n Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly\\n subsided.\\n\\n\\n \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior\\n terrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that\\n sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their\\n eyes, we can be ruined.\"\\n\\n\\n The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while\\n Father Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got\\n nowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.\\n\\n\\n \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom\\n of your trouble, but the\\nthings\\nof Earth. Think of the telegraph and\\n the newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth.\\n The merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these\\n newspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are\\n intrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to\\n buy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you\\n might also have advertisements of your own.\"\\n\\n\\n Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising\\n from the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the\\n advertisements of the Earthmen.\\n\\n\\n In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the\\n brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several\\n things had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal\\n rest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had\\n procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which\\n they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What\\n they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered\\n in the underlayers of the planet\\'s crust. Crews of Zurians, working\\n under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil\\n regions to every major and minor city on Zur.\\nBy the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\\n terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\\n gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\\n was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\\n at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\\n brothers Masur.\\n\\n\\n The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\\n energetic protest to the governor of Lor.\\n\\n\\n At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\\n for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\\n departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\\n Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\\n much new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\\n\\n\\n \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\\n blackly.\\n\\n\\n In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\\n receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\\n loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\\n radio parts. This was Earth\\'s first step toward flooding Zur with the\\n natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising—radio programs—with\\n commercials.\\n\\n\\n Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\\n they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\\n\\n\\n \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\\n paused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\\n modern—keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\\n all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\\n great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\\n ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\\n are even bringing\\nautos\\nto Zur!\"\\n\\n\\n The brothers were fascinated with the governor\\'s description of these\\n hitherto unheard-of vehicles.\\n\\n\\n \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\\n Earthmen are taking care of that.\"\\n\\n\\n At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\\n that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\\n and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\\n highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\\n yet.\\nRadio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people\\n bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways\\n were constructed.\\n\\n\\n The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants\\n and began to manufacture Portland cement.\\n\\n\\n You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of\\n course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either\\n tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff\\n made far better road surfacing.\\n\\n\\n The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.\\n\\n\\n The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot\\n handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising\\n Council.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is that?\" asked Koltan.\\n\\n\\n \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as\\n yours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain\\n in the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with\\n it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"\\n\\n\\n The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to\\n Zotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling\\n him in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.\\n\\n\\n All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the\\n purpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they\\n had to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.\\n\\n\\n Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated\\n on their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not\\n surprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to\\n make room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved\\n with something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering\\n new automobiles.\\n\\n\\n An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now\\n that they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached\\n with desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and\\n they were the envied ones of Zur.\\n\\n\\n Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands\\n jovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a\\n better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual\\n with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in\\n the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for\\n an indefinite sense of alienness about him.\\n\\n\\n \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping\\n Zotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we\\'ll have you\\n straightened out in no time.\"\\nAll the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\\n occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman\\'s manner.\\n\\n\\n Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\\n made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\\n\\n\\n \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\\n the world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab\\n Masur—Divinity protect him—departed this life to collect his greater\\n reward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and\\n bones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone\\n is the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and\\n all because of new things coming from Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn\\'t you come\\n to me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,\\n we\\'re going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth—always to\\n do right by the customer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for\\n damages.\"\\n\\n\\n Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense\\n fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your\\n trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do\\n you own an automobile?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes\\n the music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\\n\\n\\n Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the\\n bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\\n\\n\\n \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these\\n luxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off\\n with a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car\\n from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered\\n and installed in your home.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to\\n you absolutely free—a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is\\n that you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to\\n make profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the\\n Galaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out\\n the full program takes time.\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our\\n extremely slow-moving native animals. We say, \\'Slow is the tortoise,\\n but sure.\\' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the\\n motto, \\'Better times with better merchandise.\\'\"\\nThe engaging manner of the man won Zotul\\'s confidence. After all, it\\n was no more than fair to pay transportation.\\n\\n\\n He said, \"How much does the freight cost?\"\\n\\n\\n Broderick told him.\\n\\n\\n \"It may seem high,\" said the Earthman, \"but remember that Earth is\\n sixty-odd light-years away. After all, we are absorbing the cost of the\\n merchandise. All you pay is the freight, which is cheap, considering\\n the cost of operating an interstellar spaceship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Impossible,\" said Zotul drably. \"Not I and all my brothers together\\n have so much money any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t know us of Earth very well yet, but you will. I offer you\\n credit!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What is that?\" asked Zotul skeptically.\\n\\n\\n \"It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the\\n rich,\" said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the\\n involutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that\\n might have had a discouraging effect.\\n\\n\\n On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting.\\n Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. \"What must I do\\n to get credit?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just sign this paper,\" said Broderick, \"and you become part of our\\n Easy Payment Plan.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul drew back. \"I have five brothers. If I took all these things for\\n myself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Here.\" Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. \"Have each\\n of your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is\\n all there is to it.\"\\n\\n\\n It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul\\n wrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.\\n\\n\\n \"I will talk it over with them,\" he said. \"Give me the total so I will\\n have the figures.\"\\n\\n\\n The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul\\n pointed this out politely.\\n\\n\\n \"Interest,\" Broderick explained. \"A mere fifteen per cent. After all,\\n you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be\\n paid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight.\\n This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see.\" Zotul puzzled over it sadly. \"It is too much,\" he said. \"Our\\n plant doesn\\'t make enough money for us to meet the payments.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have a surprise for you,\" smiled Broderick. \"Here is a contract. You\\n will start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain\\n parts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local\\n manufacture to help bring prices down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We haven\\'t the equipment.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We will equip your plant,\" beamed Broderick. \"It will require only\\n a quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial\\n company.\"\\nZotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman,\\n won over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter\\n interest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth.\\n These, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.\\n\\n\\n The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the\\n Earthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.\\n\\n\\n For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the\\n new concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a\\n terrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from\\n the crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit.\\n The food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges,\\n served up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the\\n winter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though\\n they had gas-fired central heating.\\n\\n\\n About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric\\n generators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of\\n electrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason,\\n batteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to\\n buy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\\n\\n\\n The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan.\\n They had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric\\n fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could\\n possibly sell them.\\n\\n\\n \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but\\n meantime we have the things and aren\\'t they worth it?\"\\n\\n\\n But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.\\n The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The\\n Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because\\n it was so much more efficient—and to lower prices, which was Earth\\'s\\n unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded.\\n Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.\\n\\n\\n The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets\\n were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and\\n maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth\\n had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth,\\n but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.\\n\\n\\n The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush\\n business.\\nFor the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade\\n and a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this\\n backward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was\\n slow, but it was extremely sure.\\n\\n\\n The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less\\n money and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television\\n kept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the\\n pangs of impoverishment.\\n\\n\\n The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul\\n designed and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons\\n were a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold\\n them for less.\\n\\n\\n The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any\\n more, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\\n\\n\\n \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with\\n fists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some\\n contracts to continue operating.\"\\n\\n\\n Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr.\\n Broderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him.\\n Would he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.\\n\\n\\n Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint\\n of toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\\n\\n\\n \"So you can\\'t pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He\\n looked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of\\n making it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\\n\\n\\n \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything\\n attached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are\\n attached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that—yet. We\\n will only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your\\n pottery to us.\"\\n\\n\\n The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of\\n beating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was\\n somewhat comforted.\\n\\n\\n \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the\\n governor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of\\n Masur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is\\n time for the government to do something for us.\"\\nThe governor\\'s palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of\\n confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for\\n an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It\\n was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female\\n terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men\\n covetous and Zurian women envious.\\n\\n\\n \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Me?\" marveled Zotul.\\n\\n\\n She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor\\n of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a\\n friendly smile.\\n\\n\\n \"Come in, come in! I\\'m glad to see you again.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick,\\n the Earthman.\\n\\n\\n \"I—I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.\\n\\n\\n Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted\\n with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are\\n about to lose our plant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away\\n from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and\\n richest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have\\n bought you out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Our government....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could\\n not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took\\n them over, just as we are taking you over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything\\n on Zur?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Even your armies.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But\\nwhy\\n?\"\\nBroderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared\\n down moodily into the street.\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t know what an overcrowded world is like,\" he said. \"A street\\n like this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible\\n on Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s mobbed,\" protested Zotul. \"It gave me a headache.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And to us it\\'s almost empty. The pressure of population on Earth has\\n made us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only\\n habitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least\\n populous worlds and—well, buy them out and move in.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And after that?\"\\n\\n\\n Broderick smiled gently. \"Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry\\n with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians\\n nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul sat in silent thought. \"But you did not have to buy us out. You\\n had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could\\n have been yours alone.\" He stopped in alarm. \"Or am I suggesting an\\n idea that didn\\'t occur to you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with\\n memory. \"We know the history of conquest all too well. Our method\\n causes more distress than we like to inflict, but it\\'s better—and more\\n sure—than war and invasion by force. Now that the unpleasant job is\\n finished, we can repair the dislocations.\"\\n\\n\\n \"At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Slow but sure.\" Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the\\n shoulder. \"Don\\'t worry. You\\'ll have your job back, the same as always,\\n but you\\'ll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur\\n are equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That\\'s why we had\\n to break down your caste system.\"\\n\\n\\n Zotul\\'s eyes widened. \"And that is why my brothers did not beat me when\\n I failed!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and\\n your brothers to sign?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Zotul. \"I am ready.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

LEE\\n\\n\\n Illustrated by DILLON\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Galaxy Magazine October 1960.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe weatherman was always right:\\n \\nTemperature, 59; humidity, 47%;\\n \\noccasional light showers—but of what?\\nThe pockets of Mr. Humphrey Fownes were being picked outrageously.\\n\\n\\n It was a splendid day. The temperature was a crisp 59 degrees, the\\n humidity a mildly dessicated 47%. The sun was a flaming orange ball in\\n a cloudless blue sky.\\n\\n\\n His pockets were picked eleven times.\\n\\n\\n It should have been difficult. Under the circumstances it was a\\n masterpiece of pocket picking. What made it possible was Humphrey\\n Fownes\\' abstraction; he was an uncommonly preoccupied individual. He\\n was strolling along a quiet residential avenue: small private houses,\\n one after another, a place of little traffic and minimum distractions.\\n But he was thinking about weather, which was an unusual subject to\\n begin with for a person living in a domed city. He was thinking so\\n deeply about it that it never occurred to him that entirely too many\\n people were bumping into him. He was thinking about Optimum Dome\\n Conditions \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32ma crisp 59 degrees, a mildly dessicated 47%\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m when a bogus\\n postman, who pretended to be reading a postal card, jostled him. In the\\n confusion of spilled letters and apologies from both sides, the postman\\n rifled Fownes\\'s handkerchief and inside jacket pockets.\\nHe was still thinking about temperature and humidity when a pretty girl\\n happened along with something in her eye. They collided. She got his\\n right and left jacket pockets. It was much too much for coincidence.\\n The sidewalk was wide enough to allow four people to pass at one time.\\n He should surely have become suspicious when two men engaged in a\\n heated argument came along. In the ensuing contretemps they emptied his\\n rear pants pockets, got his wristwatch and restored the contents of the\\nhandkerchief pocket. It all went off very smoothly, like a game of put\\n and take—the sole difference being that Humphrey Fownes had no idea he\\n was playing.\\n\\n\\n There was an occasional tinkle of falling glass.\\n\\n\\n It fell on the streets and houses, making small geysers of shiny mist,\\n hitting with a gentle musical sound, like the ephemeral droppings of\\n a celesta. It was precipitation peculiar to a dome: feather-light\\n fragments showering harmlessly on the city from time to time. Dome\\n weevils, their metal arms reaching out with molten glass, roamed the\\n huge casserole, ceaselessly patching and repairing.\\n\\n\\n Humphrey Fownes strode through the puffs of falling glass still\\n intrigued by a temperature that was always 59 degrees, by a humidity\\n that was always 47%, by weather that was always Optimum. It was this\\n rather than skill that enabled the police to maintain such a tight\\n surveillance on him, a surveillance that went to the extent of getting\\n his fingerprints off the postman\\'s bag, and which photographed, X-rayed\\n and chemically analyzed the contents of his pockets before returning\\n them. Two blocks away from his home a careless housewife spilled a\\n five-pound bag of flour as he was passing. It was really plaster of\\n Paris. He left his shoe prints, stride measurement, height, weight and\\n handedness behind.\\n\\n\\n By the time Fownes reached his front door an entire dossier complete\\n with photographs had been prepared and was being read by two men in an\\n orange patrol car parked down the street.\\nLanfierre had undoubtedly been affected by his job.\\n\\n\\n Sitting behind the wheel of the orange car, he watched Humphrey Fownes\\n approach with a distinct feeling of admiration, although it was an\\n odd, objective kind of admiration, clinical in nature. It was similar\\n to that of a pathologist observing for the first time a new and\\n particularly virulent strain of pneumococcus under his microscope.\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre\\'s job was to ferret out aberration. It couldn\\'t be tolerated\\n within the confines of a dome. Conformity had become more than a social\\n force; it was a physical necessity. And, after years of working at it,\\n Lanfierre had become an admirer of eccentricity. He came to see that\\n genuine quirks were rare and, as time went on, due partly to his own\\n small efforts, rarer.\\n\\n\\n Fownes was a masterpiece of queerness. He was utterly inexplicable.\\n Lanfierre was almost proud of Humphrey Fownes.\\n\\n\\n \"Sometimes his house\\nshakes\\n,\" Lanfierre said.\\n\\n\\n \"House shakes,\" Lieutenant MacBride wrote in his notebook. Then he\\n stopped and frowned. He reread what he\\'d just written.\\n\\n\\n \"You heard right. The house\\nshakes\\n,\" Lanfierre said, savoring it.\\n\\n\\n MacBride looked at the Fownes house through the magnifying glass of\\n the windshield. \"Like from ...\\nside to side\\n?\" he asked in a somewhat\\n patronizing tone of voice.\\n\\n\\n \"And up and down.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride returned the notebook to the breast pocket of his orange\\n uniform. \"Go on,\" he said, amused. \"It sounds interesting.\" He tossed\\n the dossier carelessly on the back seat.\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre sat stiffly behind the wheel, affronted. The cynical MacBride\\n couldn\\'t really appreciate fine aberrations. In some ways MacBride\\n was a barbarian. Lanfierre had held out on Fownes for months. He\\n had even contrived to engage him in conversation once, a pleasantly\\n absurd, irrational little chat that titillated him for weeks. It was\\n only with the greatest reluctance that he finally mentioned Fownes\\n to MacBride. After years of searching for differences Lanfierre had\\n seen how extraordinarily repetitious people were, echoes really, dimly\\n resounding echoes, each believing itself whole and separate. They spoke\\n in an incessant chatter of cliches, and their actions were unbelievably\\n trite.\\n\\n\\n Then a fine robust freak came along and the others—the echoes—refused\\n to believe it. The lieutenant was probably on the point of suggesting a\\n vacation.\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you take a vacation?\" Lieutenant MacBride suggested.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s like this, MacBride. Do you know what a wind is? A breeze? A\\n zephyr?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve heard some.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They say there are mountain-tops where winds blow all the time. Strong\\n winds, MacBride. Winds like you and I can\\'t imagine. And if there was\\n a house sitting on such a mountain and if winds\\ndid\\nblow, it would\\n shake exactly the way that one does. Sometimes I get the feeling the\\n whole place is going to slide off its foundation and go sailing down\\n the avenue.\"\\nLieutenant MacBride pursed his lips.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll tell you something else,\" Lanfierre went on. \"The\\nwindows\\nall\\n close at the same time. You\\'ll be watching and all of a sudden every\\n single window in the place will drop to its sill.\" Lanfierre leaned\\n back in the seat, his eyes still on the house. \"Sometimes I think\\n there\\'s a whole crowd of people in there waiting for a signal—as if\\n they all had something important to say but had to close the windows\\n first so no one could hear. Why else close the windows in a domed city?\\n And then as soon as the place is buttoned up they all explode into\\n conversation—and that\\'s why the house shakes.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride whistled.\\n\\n\\n \"No, I don\\'t need a vacation.\"\\n\\n\\n A falling piece of glass dissolved into a puff of gossamer against the\\n windshield. Lanfierre started and bumped his knee on the steering wheel.\\n\\n\\n \"No, you don\\'t need a rest,\" MacBride said. \"You\\'re starting to see\\n flying houses, hear loud babbling voices. You\\'ve got winds in your\\n brain, Lanfierre, breezes of fatigue, zephyrs of irrationality—\"\\n\\n\\n At that moment, all at once, every last window in the house slammed\\n shut.\\n\\n\\n The street was deserted and quiet, not a movement, not a sound.\\n MacBride and Lanfierre both leaned forward, as if waiting for the\\n ghostly babble of voices to commence.\\n\\n\\n The house began to shake.\\n\\n\\n It rocked from side to side, it pitched forward and back, it yawed and\\n dipped and twisted, straining at the mooring of its foundation. The\\n house could have been preparing to take off and sail down the....\\n\\n\\n MacBride looked at Lanfierre and Lanfierre looked at MacBride and then\\n they both looked back at the dancing house.\\n\\n\\n \"And the\\nwater\\n,\" Lanfierre said. \"The\\nwater\\nhe uses! He could be\\n the thirstiest and cleanest man in the city. He could have a whole\\n family of thirsty and clean kids, and he\\nstill\\nwouldn\\'t need all that\\n water.\"\\n\\n\\n The lieutenant had picked up the dossier. He thumbed through the pages\\n now in amazement. \"Where do you get a guy like this?\" he asked. \"Did\\n you see what he carries in his pockets?\"\\n\\n\\n \"And compasses won\\'t work on this street.\"\\n\\n\\n The lieutenant lit a cigarette and sighed.\\n\\n\\n He usually sighed when making the decision to raid a dwelling. It\\n expressed his weariness and distaste for people who went off and got\\n neurotic when they could be enjoying a happy, normal existence. There\\n was something implacable about his sighs.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll be coming out soon,\" Lanfierre said. \"He eats supper next door\\n with a widow. Then he goes to the library. Always the same. Supper at\\n the widow\\'s next door and then the library.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride\\'s eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. \"The library?\" he\\n said. \"Is he in with that bunch?\"\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"Should be very interesting,\" MacBride said slowly.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t wait to see what he\\'s got in there,\" Lanfierre murmured,\\n watching the house with a consuming interest.\\n\\n\\n They sat there smoking in silence and every now and then their eyes\\n widened as the house danced a new step.\\nFownes stopped on the porch to brush the plaster of paris off his\\n shoes. He hadn\\'t seen the patrol car and this intense preoccupation\\n of his was also responsible for the dancing house—he simply hadn\\'t\\n noticed. There was a certain amount of vibration, of course. He\\n had a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system, and the\\n high-pressure air caused some buffeting against the thin walls of the\\n house. At least, he called it buffeting; he\\'d never thought to watch\\n from outside.\\n\\n\\n He went in and threw his jacket on the sofa, there being no room\\n left in the closets. Crossing the living room he stopped to twist a\\n draw-pull.\\n\\n\\n Every window slammed shut.\\n\\n\\n \"Tight as a kite,\" he thought, satisfied. He continued on toward the\\n closet at the foot of the stairs and then stopped again. Was that\\n right? No,\\nsnug as a hug in a rug\\n. He went on, thinking:\\nThe old\\n devils.\\nThe downstairs closet was like a great watch case, a profusion of\\n wheels surrounding the Master Mechanism, which was a miniature see-saw\\n that went back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels had a\\n curious stateliness about them. They were all quite old, salvaged from\\n grandfather\\'s clocks and music boxes and they went around in graceful\\n circles at the rate of 30 and 31 times an hour ... although there\\n was one slightly eccentric cam that vacillated between 28 and 29. He\\n watched as they spun and flashed in the darkness, and then set them for\\n seven o\\'clock in the evening, April seventh, any year.\\n\\n\\n Outside, the domed city vanished.\\n\\n\\n It was replaced by an illusion. Or, as Fownes hoped it might appear,\\n the illusion of the domed city vanished and was replaced by a more\\n satisfactory, and, for his specific purpose, more functional, illusion.\\n Looking through the window he saw only a garden.\\n\\n\\n Instead of an orange sun at perpetual high noon, there was a red sun\\n setting brilliantly, marred only by an occasional arcover which left\\n the smell of ozone in the air. There was also a gigantic moon. It hid a\\n huge area of sky, and it sang. The sun and moon both looked down upon a\\n garden that was itself scintillant, composed largely of neon roses.\\n\\n\\n Moonlight, he thought, and roses. Satisfactory.\\nAnd cocktails for\\n two.\\nBlast, he\\'d never be able to figure that one out! He watched as\\n the moon played,\\nOh, You Beautiful Doll\\nand the neon roses flashed\\n slowly from red to violet, then went back to the closet and turned on\\n the scent. The house began to smell like an immensely concentrated rose\\n as the moon shifted to\\nPeople Will Say We\\'re In Love\\n.\\nHe rubbed his chin critically. It\\nseemed\\nall right. A dreamy sunset,\\n an enchanted moon, flowers, scent.\\n\\n\\n They were all purely speculative of course. He had no idea how a rose\\n really smelled—or looked for that matter. Not to mention a moon. But\\n then, neither did the widow. He\\'d have to be confident, assertive.\\nInsist\\non it. I tell you, my dear, this is a genuine realistic\\n romantic moon. Now, does it do anything to your pulse? Do you feel icy\\n fingers marching up and down your spine?\\n\\n\\n His own spine didn\\'t seem to be affected. But then he hadn\\'t read that\\n book on ancient mores and courtship customs.\\n\\n\\n How really odd the ancients were. Seduction seemed to be an incredibly\\n long and drawn-out process, accompanied by a considerable amount\\n of falsification. Communication seemed virtually impossible. \"No\"\\n meant any number of things, depending on the tone of voice and the\\n circumstances. It could mean yes, it could mean ask me again later on\\n this evening.\\n\\n\\n He went up the stairs to the bedroom closet and tried the rain-maker,\\n thinking roguishly:\\nThou shalt not inundate.\\nThe risks he was taking!\\n A shower fell gently on the garden and a male chorus began to chant\\nSinging in the Rain\\n. Undiminished, the yellow moon and the red sun\\n continued to be brilliant, although the sun occasionally arced over and\\n demolished several of the neon roses.\\n\\n\\n The last wheel in the bedroom closet was a rather elegant steering\\n wheel from an old 1995 Studebaker. This was on the bootleg pipe; he\\n gingerly turned it.\\n\\n\\n Far below in the cellar there was a rumble and then the soft whistle of\\n winds came to him.\\n\\n\\n He went downstairs to watch out the living room window. This was\\n important; the window had a really fixed attitude about air currents.\\n The neon roses bent and tinkled against each other as the wind rose and\\n the moon shook a trifle as it whispered\\nCuddle Up a Little Closer\\n.\\n\\n\\n He watched with folded arms, considering how he would start.\\nMy dear\\n Mrs. Deshazaway.\\nToo formal. They\\'d be looking out at the romantic\\n garden; time to be a bit forward.\\nMy very dear Mrs. Deshazaway.\\nNo.\\n Contrived. How about a simple,\\nDear Mrs. Deshazaway\\n. That might be\\n it.\\nI was wondering, seeing as how it\\'s so late, if you wouldn\\'t\\n rather stay over instead of going home....\\nPreoccupied, he hadn\\'t noticed the winds building up, didn\\'t hear the\\n shaking and rattling of the pipes. There were attic pipes connected\\n to wall pipes and wall pipes connected to cellar pipes, and they made\\n one gigantic skeleton that began to rattle its bones and dance as\\n high-pressure air from the dome blower rushed in, slowly opening the\\n Studebaker valve wider and wider....\\n\\n\\n The neon roses thrashed about, extinguishing each other. The red sun\\n shot off a mass of sparks and then quickly sank out of sight. The moon\\n fell on the garden and rolled ponderously along, crooning\\nWhen the\\n Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day\\n.\\n\\n\\n The shaking house finally woke him up. He scrambled upstairs to the\\n Studebaker wheel and shut it off.\\n\\n\\n At the window again, he sighed. Repairs were in order. And it wasn\\'t\\n the first time the winds got out of line.\\n\\n\\n Why didn\\'t she marry him and save all this bother? He shut it all down\\n and went out the front door, wondering about the rhyme of the months,\\n about stately August and eccentric February and romantic April. April.\\n Its days were thirty and it followed September.\\nAnd all the rest have\\n thirty-one.\\nWhat a strange people, the ancients!\\n\\n\\n He still didn\\'t see the orange car parked down the street.\\n\"Men are too perishable,\" Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. \"For all\\n practical purposes I\\'m never going to marry again. All my husbands die.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said.\\n\\n\\n She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don\\'t look at me\\n that way,\" she said. \"I\\'m\\nnot\\ngoing to marry you and if you want\\n reasons I\\'ll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\"\\n\\n\\n The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything\\n passionately—talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately\\n red. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry\\n tinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had\\n never known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\"\\n she said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for\\n her to be, to explain why she couldn\\'t marry him. \"Do you have any\\n idea what people are saying? They\\'re all saying I\\'m a cannibal! I rob\\n my husbands of their life force and when they\\'re empty I carry their\\n bodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there\\'ll be\\n talk.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s the air! Why don\\'t they talk about that? The air is stale,\\n I\\'m positive. It\\'s not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt,\\n Norman and Alphonse couldn\\'t stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so\\n healthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily\\n worse for him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t seem to mind the air.\"\\n\\n\\n She threw up her hands. \"You\\'d be the worst of the lot!\" She left the\\n table, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try\\n some of the asparagus.\\nFive.\\nThat\\'s what they\\'d say. That woman did\\n it again. And the plain fact is I don\\'t want you on my record.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\"\\n\\n\\n He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his\\n shoulders. \"And what about those\\nvery\\nelaborate plans you\\'ve been\\n making to seduce me?\"\\n\\n\\n Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you think\\nthey\\'ll\\nfind out?\\nI\\nfound out and you can bet\\nthey\\nwill. It\\'s my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don\\'t\\n always tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it\\n wasn\\'t the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can\\'t\\n have another man die on me, it\\'s bad for my self-esteem. And now you\\'ve\\n gone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\"\\nFownes put his fork down. \"Dear Mrs. Deshazaway,\" he started to say.\\n\\n\\n \"And of course when they do find out and they ask you why, Mr. Fownes,\\n you\\'ll tell them. No, no heroics, please! When they ask a man a\\n question he always answers and you will too. You\\'ll tell them I wanted\\n to be courted and when they hear that they\\'ll be around to ask\\nme\\na\\n few questions. You see, we\\'re both a bit queer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hadn\\'t thought of that,\" Fownes said quietly.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, it doesn\\'t really matter. I\\'ll join Andrew, Curt, Norman—\"\\n\\n\\n \"That won\\'t be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all\\n due respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state\\n here and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We\\'re\\n lost, you and I.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s impossible! How?\"\\n\\n\\n In no hurry, now that he had the widow\\'s complete attention, Fownes\\n leaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway?\\n Space? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has\\n no control whatever? Where the\\nwind\\nblows across\\nprairies\\n; or is\\n it the other way around? No matter. How would you like\\nthat\\n, Mrs.\\n Deshazaway?\"\\n\\n\\n Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her\\n two hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.\\n And June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is\\n supposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond\\n the dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nAnd\\n,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say\\n that somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,\\n the sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it\\'s\\nvernal\\nand that\\'s when it roams the Open Country where geigers no\\n longer scintillate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMy.\\n\" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came\\n back to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us\\n outside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays\\nwarm\\nlong enough\\n for his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...\\n you may call me Agnes.\"\\nWhen Humphrey Fownes stepped out of the widow\\'s house, there was a\\n look of such intense abstraction on his features that Lanfierre felt a\\n wistful desire to get out of the car and walk along with the man. It\\n would be such a\\ndeliciously\\ninsane experience. \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\"April has thirty\\n days,\" Fownes mumbled, passing them, \"because thirty is the largest\\n number such that all smaller numbers not having a common divisor\\n with it are\\nprimes\\n.\" MacBride frowned and added it to the dossier.\\n Lanfierre sighed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n Pinning his hopes on the Movement, Fownes went straight to the\\n library several blocks away, a shattered depressing place given over\\n to government publications and censored old books with holes in\\n them. It was used so infrequently that the Movement was able to meet\\n there undisturbed. The librarian was a yellowed, dog-eared woman of\\n eighty. She spent her days reading ancient library cards and, like the\\n books around her, had been rendered by time\\'s own censor into near\\n unintelligibility.\\n\\n\\n \"Here\\'s one,\" she said to him as he entered. \"\\nGulliver\\'s Travels.\\nLoaned to John Wesley Davidson on March 14, 1979 for\\nfive\\ndays. What\\n do you make of it?\"\\n\\n\\n In the litter of books and cards and dried out ink pads that surrounded\\n the librarian, Fownes noticed a torn dust jacket with a curious\\n illustration. \"What\\'s that?\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"A twister,\" she replied quickly. \"Now listen to\\nthis\\n. Seven years\\n later on March 21, 1986, Ella Marshall Davidson took out the same book.\\n What do you make of\\nthat\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d say,\" Humphrey Fownes said, \"that he ... that he recommended it\\n to her, that one day they met in the street and he told her about\\n this book and then they ... they went to the library together and she\\n borrowed it and eventually, why eventually they got married.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hah! They were brother and sister!\" the librarian shouted in her\\n parched voice, her old buckram eyes laughing with cunning.\\n\\n\\n Fownes smiled weakly and looked again at the dust jacket. The twister\\n was unquestionably a meteorological phenomenon. It spun ominously, like\\n a malevolent top, and coursed the countryside destructively, carrying\\n a Dorothy to an Oz. He couldn\\'t help wondering if twisters did anything\\n to feminine pulses, if they could possibly be a part of a moonlit\\n night, with cocktails and roses. He absently stuffed the dust jacket\\n in his pocket and went on into the other rooms, the librarian mumbling\\n after him: \"Edna Murdoch Featherstone, April 21, 1991,\" as though\\n reading inscriptions on a tombstone.\\nThe Movement met in what had been the children\\'s room, where unpaid\\n ladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other\\n people\\'s offspring. The members sat around at the miniature tables\\n looking oddly like giants fled from their fairy tales, protesting.\\n\\n\\n \"Where did the old society fail?\" the leader was demanding of them. He\\n stood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane. He\\n glanced around at the group almost complacently, and waited as Humphrey\\n Fownes squeezed into an empty chair. \"We live in a dome,\" the leader\\n said, \"for lack of something. An invention! What is the one thing\\n that the great technological societies before ours could not invent,\\n notwithstanding their various giant brains, electronic and otherwise?\"\\n\\n\\n Fownes was the kind of man who never answered a rhetorical question. He\\n waited, uncomfortable in the tight chair, while the others struggled\\n with this problem in revolutionary dialectics.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nA sound foreign policy\\n,\" the leader said, aware that no one else had\\n obtained the insight. \"If a sound foreign policy can\\'t be created the\\n only alternative is not to have any foreign policy at all. Thus the\\n movement into domes began—\\nby common consent of the governments\\n. This\\n is known as self-containment.\"\\n\\n\\n Dialectically out in left field, Humphrey Fownes waited for a lull\\n in the ensuing discussion and then politely inquired how it might be\\n arranged for him to get out.\\n\\n\\n \"Out?\" the leader said, frowning. \"Out? Out where?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Outside the dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh. All in good time, my friend. One day we shall all pick up and\\n leave.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And that day I\\'ll await impatiently,\" Fownes replied with marvelous\\n tact, \"because it will be lonely out there for the two of us. My future\\n wife and I have to leave\\nnow\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense. Ridiculous! You have to be prepared for the Open Country.\\n You can\\'t just up and leave, it would be suicide, Fownes. And\\n dialectically very poor.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then you\\nhave\\ndiscussed preparations, the practical necessities of\\n life in the Open Country. Food, clothing, a weapon perhaps? What else?\\n Have I left anything out?\"\\n\\n\\n The leader sighed. \"The gentleman wants to know if he\\'s left anything\\n out,\" he said to the group.\\n\\n\\n Fownes looked around at them, at some dozen pained expressions.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell the man what he\\'s forgotten,\" the leader said, walking to the far\\n window and turning his back quite pointedly on them.\\n\\n\\n Everyone spoke at the same moment. \"\\nA sound foreign policy\\n,\" they all\\n said, it being almost too obvious for words.\\nOn his way out the librarian shouted at him: \"\\nA Tale of a Tub\\n,\\n thirty-five years overdue!\" She was calculating the fine as he closed\\n the door.\\n\\n\\n Humphrey Fownes\\' preoccupation finally came to an end when he was one\\n block away from his house. It was then that he realized something\\n unusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police\\n was parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.\\n\\n\\n His house was dancing.\\n\\n\\n It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one\\'s\\n residence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight\\n that for the moment he didn\\'t give a thought to what might be causing\\n it. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its\\n own independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense\\n curiosity.\\n\\n\\n The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.\\n\\n\\n From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as\\n his favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of\\n cold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A\\n wild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs,\\n suits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa\\n cushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an\\n old, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his\\n ancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.\\n\\n\\n He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying\\n with his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his\\n cheeks. He got hit by a shoe.\\n\\n\\n As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over\\n his face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.\\n\\n\\n \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called.\\n\\n\\n Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his\\n dripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the\\n distance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWinds\\n,\" he said in a whisper.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMarch\\nwinds,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What?!\"\\n\\n\\n \"April showers!\"\\n\\n\\n The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride\\'s lost voice emerged\\n from the blackness of the living room. \"These are\\nnot\\nOptimum Dome\\n Conditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is\\nnot\\n59 degrees.\\n The humidity is\\nnot\\n47%!\"\\nFownes held his face up to let the rain fall on it. \"Moonlight!\" he\\n shouted. \"Roses! My\\nsoul\\nfor a cocktail for two!\" He grasped the\\n doorway to keep from being blown out of the house.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you going to make it stop or aren\\'t you!\" MacBride yelled.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll have to tell me what you did first!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\ntold\\nhim not to touch that wheel! Lanfierre. He\\'s in the upstairs\\n bedroom!\"\\n\\n\\n When he heard this Fownes plunged into the house and fought his way\\n up the stairs. He found Lanfierre standing outside the bedroom with a\\n wheel in his hand.\\n\"What have I done?\" Lanfierre asked in the monotone of shock.\\n\\n\\n Fownes took the wheel. It was off a 1995 Studebaker.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not sure what\\'s going to come of this,\" he said to Lanfierre with\\n an astonishing amount of objectivity, \"but the entire dome air supply\\n is now coming through my bedroom.\"\\n\\n\\n The wind screamed.\\n\\n\\n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not any more there isn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n They started down the stairs carefully, but the wind caught them and\\n they quickly reached the bottom in a wet heap.\\n\\n\\n Recruiting Lieutenant MacBride from behind his sofa, the men carefully\\n edged out of the house and forced the front door shut.\\n\\n\\n The wind died. The fog dispersed. They stood dripping in the Optimum\\n Dome Conditions of the bright avenue.\\n\\n\\n \"I never figured on\\nthis\\n,\" Lanfierre said, shaking his head.\\n\\n\\n With the front door closed the wind quickly built up inside the house.\\n They could see the furnishing whirl past the windows. The house did a\\n wild, elated jig.\\n\\n\\n \"What kind of a place\\nis\\nthis?\" MacBride said, his courage beginning\\n to return. He took out his notebook but it was a soggy mess. He tossed\\n it away.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, he was\\ndifferent\\n,\" Lanfierre murmured. \"I knew that much.\"\\n\\n\\n When the roof blew off they weren\\'t really surprised. With a certain\\n amount of equanimity they watched it lift off almost gracefully,\\n standing on end for a moment before toppling to the ground. It was\\n strangely slow motion, as was the black twirling cloud that now rose\\n out of the master bedroom, spewing shorts and socks and cases every\\n which way.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nNow\\nwhat?\" MacBride said, thoroughly exasperated, as this strange\\n black cloud began to accelerate, whirling about like some malevolent\\n top....\\nHumphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he\\'d found in the library. He\\n held it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom\\n with the illustration. The cloud rose and spun, assuming the identical\\n shape of the illustration.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a twister,\" he said softly. \"A Kansas twister!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What,\" MacBride asked, his bravado slipping away again, \"what ... is a\\n twister?\"\\n\\n\\n The twister roared and moved out of the bedroom, out over the rear of\\n the house toward the side of the dome. \"It says here,\" Fownes shouted\\n over the roaring, \"that Dorothy traveled from Kansas to Oz in a twister\\n and that ... and that Oz is a wonderful and mysterious land\\nbeyond the\\n confines of everyday living\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n MacBride\\'s eyes and mouth were great zeros.\\n\\n\\n \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\\n\\n\\n Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them.\\n\\n\\n \"Fownes!\" MacBride shouted. \"This is a direct order! Make it go back!\"\\n\\n\\n But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging\\n mountainous puffs of glass as he went. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\" he shouted.\\n \"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!\"\\n\\n\\n The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the\\n precipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then,\\n emptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly\\n emptied and then rushed about empty-handed. \"Yoo-hoo!\" he yelled,\\n running. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister.\\n Optimum temperature collapsed. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\\nAgnes\\n, will you\\n marry me? Yoo-hoo!\"\\n\\n\\n Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited,\\n dazed.\\n\\n\\n There was quite a large fall of glass.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Then why was a non-suicidal\\n\\n man driven to suicide there? Yet it made sense.\\nWhy do people commit suicide?\\nTemplin tightened his safety belt and lay back on the acceleration\\n bunk. The lights in the cabin dimmed to a dull, red glow that meant the\\n time for takeoff was nearing. He could hear noises from deep within\\n the ship and the tiny whir of the ventilator fan, filling the air with\\n the sweetish smell of sleeping gas. To sleep the trip away was better\\n than to face the dull monotony of the stars for days on end.\\nOh, they kill themselves for lots of reasons. Maybe ill health or\\n financial messes or family difficulties. An unhappy love affair. Or\\n more complex ones, if you went into it deeper. The failure to achieve\\n an ambition, failure to live up to one\\'s own ideals. Weltschmerz,\\n perhaps.\\nHe could smell the bitter fragrance of tobacco smoke mingling with\\n the gas. Eckert had lit a cigarette and was calmly blowing the smoke\\n at the neon \"No Smoking\" sign, which winked on and off in mechanical\\n disapproval.\\n\\n\\n He turned his head slightly so he could just see Eckert in the bank\\n facing him. Eckert, one of the good gray men in the Service. The old\\n reliables, the ones who could take almost anything in their stride\\n because, at one time or another, they had had to.\\nIt was Eckert who had come into his office several days ago and told\\n him that Don Pendleton had killed himself.\\nOnly Pendleton wasn\\'t the type. He was the kind who have everything\\n to live for, the kind you instinctively know will amount to something\\n someday. And that was a lousy way to remember him. The clichés always\\n come first. Your memory plays traitor and boils friendship down to the\\n status of a breakfast food testimonial.\\nThe soft red lights seemed to be dancing in the darkness of the cabin.\\n Eckert was just a dull, formless blur opposite him. His cigarette was\\n out.\\n\\n\\n Eckert had come into his office without saying a word and had watched\\n his scenery-window. It had been snowing in the window, the white flakes\\n making a simple pattern drifting past the glass. Eckert had fiddled\\n with the controls and changed it to sunshine, then to a weird mixture\\n of hail amid the brassy, golden sunlight.\\n\\n\\n And then Eckert had told him that Pendleton had taken the short way out.\\nHe shouldn\\'t get sentimental. But how the hell else should he remember\\n Pendleton? Try to forget it and drink a toast to him at the next class\\n reunion? And never, never be so crude as to speculate why Pendleton\\n should have done it? If, of course, he had....\\nThe cabin was hazy in the reddish glow, the sleeping gas a heavy\\n perfume.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and he had talked it out and gone over the records. Pendleton\\n had come of good stock. There had been no mental instability in his\\n family for as far back as the genetic records went. He had been raised\\n in a middle-class neighborhood and attended a local grammar school\\n where he had achieved average grades and had given his instructors the\\n normal amount of trouble. Later, when he had made up his mind to enter\\n the Diplomatic Service, his grades had improved. He had worked hard at\\n it, though he wasn\\'t what you would call a grind. In high school and\\n later in college, he was the well-balanced type, athletic, popular,\\n hard-working.\\nHow long would it be before memories faded and all there was left\\n of Pendleton was a page of statistics? He had been on this team, he\\n had been elected president of that, he had graduated with such and\\n such honors. But try getting a picture of him by reading the records,\\n resurrect him from a page of black print. Would he be human? Would\\n he be flesh and blood? Hell, no! In the statistics Pendleton was the\\n All-Around Boy, the cold marble statue with the finely chiseled muscles\\n and the smooth, blank sockets where the eyes should be. Maybe someday\\n fate would play a trick on a hero-worshiping public and there would\\n actually be kids like that. But they wouldn\\'t be human; they wouldn\\'t\\n be born. Parents would get them by sending in so many box tops.\\nHe was drowsy; the room was filled with the gas now. It would be only a\\n matter of minutes before he would be asleep.\\n\\n\\n Pendleton had been in his second year as attache on Tunpesh, a small\\n planet with a G-type sun. The Service had stumbled across it recently\\n and decided the system was worth diplomatic recognition of some kind,\\n so Pendleton had been sent there. He had been the first attache to be\\n sent and naturally he had gone alone.\\n\\n\\n There was no need to send more. Tunpesh had been inspected and\\n certified and approved. The natives were primitive and friendly. Or\\n maybe the Service had slipped up, as it sometimes did, and Tunpesh had\\n received something less than a thorough survey.\\n\\n\\n And then an unscheduled freighter had put in for repairs, one of\\n the very few ships that ever came by Tunpesh. The captain had tried\\n to pay his respects to Pendleton. Only Pendleton wasn\\'t there. The\\n natives said he had killed himself and showed the captain the little\\n flower-covered plot where they had buried him.\\n\\n\\n Tunpesh had been Pendleton\\'s second assignment.\\nThe natives were oh-so-friendly. So friendly that he had made sure\\n that a certain box was on board, filled with shiny atomic rifles,\\n needle pistols, and the fat little gas guns. They might be needed.\\n People like Pendleton didn\\'t kill themselves, did they? No, they\\n didn\\'t. But sometimes they were murdered.\\nIt was almost black inside the cabin now; only a thin red line around\\n the ceiling told how close they were to takeoff. His head was thick\\n with drowsiness, his eyelids a heavy weight that he knew he couldn\\'t\\n keep open much longer.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and he had been chosen to go to Tunpesh and investigate. The two\\n of them, working together, should be able to find out why Pendleton had\\n killed himself.\\nBut that wasn\\'t the real reason. Maybe Eckert thought so, but he knew\\n better. The real reason they were going there was to find out why\\n Pendleton had been killed and who had killed him. That was it.\\nWho had killed Cock Robin?\\nThe thin red line was practically microscopic now and Templin could\\n feel his lashes lying gently on his cheeks. But he wasn\\'t asleep—not\\n quite. There was something buzzing about in the dim recesses of his\\n mind.\\n\\n\\n Their information on Tunpesh was limited. They knew that it had no\\n trading concessions or armed forces and that nobody from neighboring\\n systems seemed to know much about it or even visited it. But a staff\\n anthropologist must have been routinely assigned to Tunpesh to furnish\\n data and reports.\\n\\n\\n \"Ted?\" he murmured sleepily.\\n\\n\\n A faint stirring in the black bulk opposite him. \"Yes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How come our anthropologist on Tunpesh didn\\'t come across with more\\n information?\"\\n\\n\\n A drowsy mumble from the other cot: \"He wasn\\'t there long enough. He\\n committed suicide not long after landing.\"\\n\\n\\n The room was a whirling pool of blackness into which his mind was\\n slowly slipping. Takeoff was only seconds away.\\nWhy do people commit suicide?\\n\"It\\'s a nice day, isn\\'t it, Ted?\" Eckert took a deep and pleasurable\\n breath. \"It\\'s the type of day that makes you feel good just to be\\n alive.\"\\n\\n\\n Warm breezes rustled through Eckert\\'s graying hair and tugged gently\\n at his tunic. The air smelled as if it had been washed and faintly\\n perfumed with the balsamy scent of something very much like pine. A\\n few hundred yards away, a forest towered straight and slim and coolly\\n inviting, and brilliantly colored birds whirled and fluttered in the\\n foliage.\\n\\n\\n The rocketport, where they were standing surrounded by their luggage,\\n was a grassy valley where the all too infrequent ships could land and\\n discharge cargo or make repairs. There was a blackened patch on it now,\\n with little blast-ignited flames dying out around the edges.\\nIt won\\'t\\n be long before it will be green again\\n, he thought. The grass looked\\n as though it grew fast—it would certainly have plenty of time to grow\\n before the next ship landed.\\n\\n\\n He looked at the slim, dwindling shape that was the rocket, and was\\n suddenly, acutely aware that he and Templin would be stranded for six\\n months on a foreign and very possibly dangerous planet. And there would\\n be no way of calling for help or of leaving before the six months were\\n up.\\n\\n\\n He stood there for a moment, drinking in the fresh air and feeling the\\n warmth of the sun against his face. It might be a pleasant six months\\n at that, away from the din and the hustle and confusion, spending the\\n time in a place where the sun was warm and inviting.\\nI must be getting old\\n, he thought,\\nthinking about the warmth and\\n comfort. Like old dogs and octogenarians.\\nTemplin was looking at the scenery with a disappointed expression on\\n his face. Eckert stole a side glance at him and for a fleeting moment\\n felt vaguely concerned. \"Don\\'t be disappointed if it doesn\\'t look like\\n cloak-and-dagger right off, Ray. What seems innocent enough on the\\n surface can prove to be quite dangerous underneath.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s rather hard to think of danger in a setting like this.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert nodded agreement. \"It wouldn\\'t fit, would it? It would be like a\\n famous singer suddenly doing a jazz number in an opera, or having the\\n princess in a fairy tale turn out to be ugly.\" He gestured toward the\\n village. \"You could hardly class that as dangerous from its outward\\n appearance, could you?\"\\n\\n\\n The rocketport was in a small valley, surrounded by low, wooded hills.\\n The village started where the port left off and crawled and wound over\\n the wooded ridges. Small houses of sun-baked, white-washed mud crouched\\n in the shadow of huge trees and hugged the banks of a small stream.\\n\\n\\n It looked fairly primitive, Eckert thought, and yet it didn\\'t have the\\n earmarks, the characteristics of most primitive villages. It didn\\'t\\n seem cluttered or dirty and you didn\\'t feel like beating a hasty\\n retreat when the wind was blowing toward you.\\n\\n\\n A few adults were watching them curiously and the usual bunch of\\n kids that always congregated around rocketports quickly gathered.\\n Eckert stared at them for a moment, wondering what it was that seemed\\n odd about them, and they stared back with all the alert dignity of\\n childhood. They finally came out on the field and clustered around him\\n and Templin.\\n\\n\\n Templin studied them warily. \"Better watch them, Ted. Even kids can be\\n dangerous.\"\\nIt\\'s because you never suspect kids\\n, Eckert thought,\\nyou never think\\n they\\'ll do any harm. But they can be taught. They could do as much\\n damage with a knife as a man could, for instance. And they might have\\n other weapons.\\nBut the idea still didn\\'t go with the warm sun and the blue sky and the\\n piny scent of the trees.\\n\\n\\n One of the adults of the village started to walk toward them.\\n\\n\\n \"The reception committee,\" Templin said tightly. His hand went inside\\n his tunic.\\n\\n\\n He couldn\\'t be blamed for being jumpy, Eckert realized. This was his\\n first time out, his first mission like this. And, of course, Pendleton\\n had been a pretty good friend of his.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d be very careful what I did,\" Eckert said softly. \"I would hate to\\n start something merely because I misunderstood their intentions.\"\\n\\n\\n The committee of one was a middle-aged man dressed in a simple strip of\\n white cloth twisted about his waist and allowed to hang freely to his\\n knees. When he got closer, Eckert became less sure of his age. He had\\n the firm, tanned musculature of a much younger man, though a slightly\\n seamed face and white hair aged him somewhat. Eckert still had the\\n feeling that if you wanted to know his exact age, you\\'d have to look\\n at his teeth or know something about his epiphyseal closures.\\n\\n\\n \"You are\\nmenshars\\nfrom Earth?\" The voice was husky and pleasant and\\n the pronunciation was very clear. Eckert regarded him thoughtfully\\n and made a few mental notes. He wasn\\'t bowing and scraping like most\\n natives who weren\\'t too familiar with visitors from the sky, and yet he\\n was hardly either friendly or hostile.\\n\\n\\n \"You learned our language from Pendleton and Reynolds?\" Reynolds had\\n been the anthropologist.\\n\\n\\n \"We have had visitors from Earth before.\" He hesitated a moment\\n and then offered his hand, somewhat shyly, Eckert thought, in the\\n Terrestrial sign of greeting. \"You may call me\\nJathong\\nif you wish.\"\\n He paused a moment to say something in his native tongue to the kids\\n who were around. They promptly scattered and picked up the luggage.\\n \"While you are here, you will need a place to stay. There is one ready,\\n if you will follow me.\"\\n\\n\\n He was polite, Eckert thought. He didn\\'t ask what they were there\\n for or how long they were going to stay. But then again, perhaps the\\n natives were a better judge of that than he and Templin.\\n\\n\\n The town was larger than he had thought at first, stretching over a\\n wide expanse of the countryside. There wasn\\'t, so far as he could see,\\n much manufacturing above the level of handicrafts and simple weaving.\\n Colored patches on far hillsides indicated the presence of farms, and\\n practically every house in the village had its small garden.\\n\\n\\n What manufacturing there was seemed to be carried on in the central\\n square of the town, where a few adults and children squatted in the\\n warm afternoon sun and worked industriously at potter\\'s wheels and\\n weaver\\'s looms. The other part of the square was given over to the\\n native bazaar where pots and bolts of cloth were for sale, and where\\n numerous stalls were loaded with dried fruits and vegetables and the\\n cleaned and plucked carcasses of the local variety of fowl.\\n\\n\\n It was late afternoon when they followed Jathong into a small,\\n white-washed house midway up a hill.\\n\\n\\n \"You are free to use this while you are here,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n Eckert and Templin took a quick tour of the few rooms. They were well\\n furnished, in a rustic sort of way, and what modern conveniences they\\n didn\\'t have they could easily do without. The youngsters who had\\n carried their luggage left it outside and quietly faded away. It was\\n getting dark; Eckert opened one of the boxes they had brought along,\\n took out an electric lantern and lighted it. He turned to Jathong.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been very kind to us and we would like to repay you. You may\\n take what you wish of anything within this box.\" He opened another of\\n the boxes and displayed the usual trade goods—brightly colored cloth\\n and finely worked jewelry and a few mechanical contrivances that Eckert\\n knew usually appealed to the primitive imagination.\\n\\n\\n Jathong ran his hand over the cloth and held some of the jewelry up to\\n the light. Eckert knew by the way he looked at it that he wasn\\'t at all\\n impressed. \"I am grateful,\" he said finally, \"but there is nothing I\\n want.\" He turned and walked away into the gathering darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"The incorruptible native.\" Templin laughed sarcastically.\\n\\n\\n Eckert shrugged. \"That\\'s one of the things you do out of habit, try\\n and buy some of the natives so you\\'ll have friends in case you need\\n them.\" He stopped for a moment, thinking. \"Did you notice the context?\\n He didn\\'t say he didn\\'t want what we showed him. He said there was\\nnothing\\nthat he wanted. Implying that everything he wanted, he\\n already had.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not very typical of a primitive society, is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I\\'m afraid it\\'s not.\" Eckert started unpacking some of the boxes.\\n \"You know, Ray, I got a kick out of the kids. They\\'re a healthy-looking\\n lot, aren\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too healthy,\" Templin said. \"There didn\\'t seem to be any sick ones or\\n ones with runny noses or cuts or black eyes or bruises. It doesn\\'t seem\\n natural.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'re probably just well brought-up kids,\" Eckert said sharply.\\n \"Maybe they\\'ve been taught not to get in fights or play around in the\\n mud on the way home from school.\" He felt faintly irritated, annoyed at\\n the way Templin had put it, as if any deviation from an Earth norm was\\n potentially dangerous.\\n\\n\\n \"Ted.\" Templin\\'s voice was strained. \"This could be a trap, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n\\n The words came out slowly. \"The people are too casual, as though\\n they\\'re playing a rehearsed part. Here we are, from an entirely\\n different solar system, landed in what must be to them an unusual\\n manner. They couldn\\'t have seen rockets more than three or four\\n times before. It should still be a novelty to them. And yet how much\\n curiosity did they show? Hardly any. Was there any fear? No. And the\\n cute, harmless little kids.\" He looked at Eckert. \"Maybe that\\'s what\\n we\\'re supposed to think—just an idyllic, harmless society. Maybe\\n that\\'s what Pendleton thought, right to the very end.\"\\n\\n\\n He was keyed up, jumpy, Eckert realized. He would probably be seeing\\n things in every shadow and imagining danger to be lurking around every\\n corner.\\n\\n\\n \"It hasn\\'t been established yet that Pendleton was killed, Ray. Let\\'s\\n keep an open mind until we know for certain.\"\\n\\n\\n He flicked out the light and lay back on the cool bed, letting his\\n body relax completely. The cool night wind blew lazily through the\\n wood slat blinds, carrying the fragrance of the trees and the grass,\\n and he inhaled deeply and let his thoughts wander for a moment. It was\\n going to be pleasant to live on Tunpesh for six months—even if the six\\n months were all they had to live. The climate was superb and the people\\n seemed a cut above the usual primitive culture. If he ever retired some\\n day, he thought suddenly, he would have to remember Tunpesh. It would\\n be pleasant to spend his old age here. And the fishing was probably\\n excellent....\\n\\n\\n He turned his head a little to watch Templin get ready for bed. There\\n were advantages in taking him along that Templin probably didn\\'t\\n even realize. He wondered what Templin would do if he ever found out\\n that the actual reason he had been chosen to go was that his own\\n psychological chart was very close to Pendleton\\'s. Pendleton\\'s own\\n feelings and emotions would almost exactly be duplicated in Templin\\'s.\\n\\n\\n A few stray wisps of starlight pierced through the blinds and sparkled\\n for an instant on a small metal box strapped to Templin\\'s waist. A\\n power pack, Eckert saw grimly, probably leading to the buttons on his\\n tunic. A very convenient, portable, and hard to detect weapon.\\n\\n\\n There were disadvantages in taking Templin, too.\\n\"Just how primitive do you think the society is, Ted?\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert put down the chain he had been whittling and reached for his\\n pipe and tobacco.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think it\\'s primitive at all. There are too many disparities.\\n Their knowledge of a lot of things is a little more than empirical\\n knowledge; they associate the growth of crops with fertilizer and\\n nitrogen in the soil as well as sunlight, rather than the blessings of\\n some native god. And they differ a lot in other respects. Their art and\\n their music are advanced. Free art exists along with purely decorative\\n art, and their techniques are finely developed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m glad you agree, then. Take a look at this.\" Templin threw a shiny\\n bit of metal on the rough-hewn table. Eckert picked it up and inspected\\n it. It was heavy and one side of it was extremely sharp.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s it for?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve got a hospital set up here. Not a hospital like any we know,\\n of course, but a hospital nonetheless. It\\'s not used very much;\\n apparently the natives don\\'t get sick here. But occasionally there are\\n hunting accidents and injuries that require surgery. The strip of metal\\n there is a scalpel.\" He laughed shortly. \"Primitive little gadget, but\\n it works well—as well as any of ours.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert hefted it in his palm. \"The most important thing is that they\\n have the knowledge to use it. Surgery isn\\'t a simple science.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what do you think about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The obvious. They evidently have as much technology as they want, at\\n least in fields where they have to have it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How come they haven\\'t gone any further?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why should they? You can live without skycars and rocket ships, you\\n know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did you ever wonder what kind of weapons they might have?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The important thing,\" Eckert mused, \"is not if they have them, but if\\n they\\'d use them. And I rather doubt that they would. We\\'ve been here\\n for two weeks now and they\\'ve been very kind to us, seeing that we\\'ve\\n had food and water and what fuel we need.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s known in the livestock trade as being fattened up for the\\n slaughter,\" Templeton said.\\n\\n\\n Eckert sighed and watched a fat bug waddle across a small patch of\\n sunlight on the wooden floor. It was bad enough drawing an assignment\\n in a totally foreign culture, even if the natives were humanoid. It\\n complicated things beyond all measure when your partner in the project\\n seemed likely to turn into a vendettist. It meant that Eckert would\\n have to split his energies. He\\'d have to do what investigating he could\\n among the Tunpeshans, and he\\'d have to watch Templin to see that he\\n didn\\'t go off half-cocked and spoil everything.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin nodded. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Tunpeshans know why we\\'re here. We\\'ve dropped enough hints along\\n those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; nobody has volunteered\\n any information about him. And he was an attache here for three\\n years. Didn\\'t anybody know him during that time? We\\'ve let slip a few\\n discreet statements that we would like to talk to Pendleton\\'s friends,\\n yet nobody\\'s come around. Apparently, in all the three years he was\\n here, Pendleton didn\\'t make any friends. And that\\'s a little hard to\\n believe. It\\'s more likely that his friends have been silenced and any\\n information about him is being withheld for a reason.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What reason?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin shrugged. \"Murder. What other reason could there be?\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the\\n scenery. A hundred feet down the road, a native woman was going to\\n market, leading a species of food animal by the halter.\\n\\n\\n \"They grow their women nice, don\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Physically perfect, like the men,\" Templin grumbled. \"You could get an\\n inferiority complex just from watching the people here. Everybody\\'s so\\n damn perfect. Nobody\\'s sick, nobody\\'s unhealthy, nobody is too fat or\\n too thin, nobody\\'s unhappy. The only variation is that they don\\'t all\\n look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Does it? I hadn\\'t noticed.\" Eckert turned away from the blinds. His\\n voice was crisp. \"I knew Don Pendleton quite well, too,\" he said. \"But\\n it isn\\'t blinding me to what I\\'m here for. We came to find out what\\n happened to him, not to substantiate any preconceived notions. What\\n we find out may be vitally important to anybody serving here in the\\n future. I would hate to see our efforts spoiled because you\\'ve already\\n made up your mind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You knew Pendleton,\" Templin repeated grimly. \"Do you think it was\\n suicide?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think there\\'s such a thing as a suicide type, when you come\\n down to it. I\\'m not ruling out the possibility of murder, either. I\\'m\\n trying to keep an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What have we accomplished so far? What have we found out?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got six months,\" Eckert said quietly. \"Six months in which\\n we\\'ll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and try to\\n cultivate informants. We would get nowhere if we came barging in asking\\n all sorts of questions. And don\\'t forget, Ray, we\\'re all alone on\\n Tunpesh. If it is a case of murder, what happens when the natives find\\n out that we know it is?\"\\n\\n\\n Templin\\'s eyes dueled for a moment. Then he turned his back and walked\\n to the window. \"I suppose you\\'re right,\" he said at last. \"It\\'s nice\\n living here, Ted. Maybe I\\'ve been fighting it. But I can\\'t help\\n thinking that Don must have liked it here, too.\"\\nOne of the hardest things to learn in a foreign culture, Eckert\\n thought, is when to enjoy yourself, when to work and when to worry.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nPelache, menshar?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSharra!\\n\" He took the small bowl of\\npelache\\nnuts, helped himself\\n to a few, and passed the bowl on. This was definitely the time to\\n enjoy himself, not to work or worry. He had heard about the\\nhalera\\na\\n few days ago, and, by judicious hinting to the proper authorities, he\\n and Templin had been invited. It was a good chance to observe native\\n customs. A little anthropology—with refreshments.\\n\\n\\n The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous\\n helpings of the roasted\\nulami\\nand the broiled\\nhalunch\\nand numerous\\n dabs from the side dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course,\\n they passed around a small flagon of the hot, spiced native wine, but\\n he noticed that nobody drank to excess.\\nThe old Greek ideal\\n, he thought:\\nmoderation in everything.\\nHe looked at Templin, sitting across from him in the huge circle, and\\n shrugged mentally. Templin looked as if he was about to break down and\\n enjoy himself, but there was still a slight bulge under his tunic,\\n where he had strapped his power pack. Any fool should have known that\\n nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The only actual danger lay\\n in Templin\\'s getting excited and doing something he was bound to regret\\n later on. And even that danger was not quite as likely now.\\nThere will be hell to pay\\n, Eckert thought,\\nif Templin ever finds out\\n that I sabotaged his power pack.\\n\"You look thoughtful,\\nmenshar\\nEckert.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert took another sip of the wine and turned to the Tunpeshan on his\\n left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm chin and a\\n certain aura of authority.\\n\\n\\n \"I was wondering if my countryman Pendleton had offended your people in\\n any way, Nayova.\" Now was as good a time as any to pump him for what he\\n knew about Pendleton\\'s death.\\n\\n\\n \"So far as I know,\\nmenshar\\nPendleton offended no one. I do not know\\n what duties he had to perform here, but he was a generous and courteous\\n man.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert gnawed the dainty meat off a slender\\nulami\\nbone and tried to\\n appear casual in his questioning.\\n\\n\\n \"I am sure he was, Nayova. I am sure, too, that you were as kind to him\\n as you have been to Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to\\n you for that.\"\\n\\n\\n Nayova seemed pleased. \"We tried to do as well for\\nmenshar\\nPendleton\\n as we could. While he was here, he had the house that you have now and\\n we saw that he was supplied with food and all other necessities.\"\\n\\n\\n Eckert had a sudden clammy feeling which quickly passed away. What\\n Nayova had said was something he\\'d make sure Templin never heard about.\\n He wiped his mouth on a broad, flat leaf that had been provided and\\n took another sip of the wine.\\n\\n\\n \"We were shocked to find out that\\nmenshar\\nPendleton had killed\\n himself. We knew him quite well and we could not bring ourselves to\\n believe he had done such a thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Nayova\\'s gaze slid away from him. \"Perhaps it was the will of the Great\\n One,\" he said vaguely. He didn\\'t seem anxious to talk about it.\\n\\n\\n Eckert stared bleakly at his wine glass and tried to put the pieces of\\n information together. They probably had a taboo about self-destruction\\n which would make it difficult to talk about. That would make it even\\n harder for him to find out by direct questioning.\\n\\n\\n A native fife trilled shrilly and a group of young men and women walked\\n into the room. The circle broke to let them through and they came and\\n knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands sharply, they retreated\\n to the center of the circle and began the slow motions of a native\\n dance.\\nThe sound of the fife softened and died and the slow monotonous beat of\\n drums took its place. The beat slowly increased and so did the rhythm\\n of the dancers. The small fires at the corners of the hut were allowed\\n to dwindle and the center of the circle became filled with the motions\\n of shadows intermixed with the swift, sure movements of glistening\\n limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently the dance was\\n the Tunpeshan version of the\\nrites de passage\\n. He glanced across\\n the circle at Templin. Templin\\'s face—what he could see of it by the\\n flickering light—was brick red.\\n\\n\\n A voice spoke in his ear. \"It is hard for us to imagine anybody doing\\n what\\nmenshar\\nPendleton did. It is ...\" and he used a native word that\\n Eckert translated as being roughly equivalent to \"\\nobscene\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n The dancers at the center of the circle finally bowed out with small\\n garlands of flowers on their heads that signified their reaching\\n adulthood. Acrobats then took the stage and went through a dizzying\\n routine, and they in turn were succeeded by a native singer.\\n\\n\\n They were all excellent, Eckert thought. If anything, they were too\\n good.\\n\\n\\n The bowl of\\npelache\\nnuts made its way around again and Nayova leaned\\n over to speak to him. \"If there is any possibility that I can help you\\n while you are here,\\nmenshar\\nEckert, you have but to ask.\"\\n\\n\\n It would probably be a mistake to ask for a list of Pendleton\\'s\\n friends, but there was a way around that. \"I would like to meet any\\n of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or\\n socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them in any way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think they would be glad to help you. I shall ask them to go to you\\n this coming week.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

There isn’t\\n anything that Judy can’t solve.”\\nLorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters\\n now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\\n loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s\\n part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\\n wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe\\n she’d understand—understand any better than I do.\\n Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no\\n exception.”\\n“You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming\\n in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\\n for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have\\n problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t\\n solve.”\\n“Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one\\n single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll\\n believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”\\n“Judy Dobbs, remember?”\\n“Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\\n all those mysteries. I met you when the whole\\n valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\\n by flood and you solved that—”\\n“That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace,\\n not me. He was the hero without even meaning to\\n be. He was the one who rode through town and\\n warned people that the flood was coming. I was off\\n chasing a shadow.”\\n“A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.\\n “What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”\\n“It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.\\n “I know now that keeping that promise not\\n to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\\n could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”\\n“Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\\n her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”\\n“Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk\\n about?”\\n“You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve\\n solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\\n two before the flood, but what about the haunted\\n house you moved into? You were the one who\\n tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\\n and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing\\n ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\\n you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”\\n“Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,\\n “there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There\\n was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\\n what she was or how she spoke to me is more than\\n I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling.\\n And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them.\\n They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\\n this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of\\n them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re\\n stored in one end of the attic.”\\n“Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed\\n Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and\\n show up the spooks?”\\n“I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”\\nJudy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\\n wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\\n but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\\n told them, the summer before they met. Horace\\n had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\\n that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton\\n Lee, who gave him his job with the\\nFarringdon\\n Daily Herald\\n. He had turned in some interesting\\n church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\\n the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\\n he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\\n where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\\n mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\\n loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\\nHer thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\\n confessed now as she reviewed everything that had\\n happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact\\n that her parents left her every summer while they\\n went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\\n think she would do?\\n“You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told\\n her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery\\n series you like. When they’re finished there are\\n plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\\n never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s\\n saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\\n them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\\n you love to read.”\\n“I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”\\nJudy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired\\n eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\\n vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\\n little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to\\n the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\\n was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\\n and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\\n went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\\n scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t\\n glad to have her.\\n“You here again?” she had greeted her that summer,\\n and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling\\n behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with\\n yourself this time?”\\n“Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say\\n you have a whole stack of old magazines—”\\n“In the attic. Go up and look them over if you\\n can stand the heat.”\\nJudy went, not to look over the old magazines so\\n much as to escape to a place where she could have a\\n good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\\n birthday. In another year she would have outgrown\\n her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or\\n be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\\n vacation of her own. In another year she would\\n be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\\n and solving a mystery to be known as the\\nGhost\\n Parade\\n.\\n“A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling\\n her, “and you solved everything.”\\nBut then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no\\n idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\\n seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears\\n came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\\n Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\\n on a picture of a fountain.\\n“A fountain with tears for water. How strange!”\\n she remembered saying aloud.\\nJudy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\\n walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\\n mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\\n fountain still caught and held rainbows like those\\n she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\\n But all that was in the future. If anyone had told\\n the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\\n day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\\n their faces.\\n“That tease!”\\nFor then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\\n used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\\n she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so\\n are you!”\\nPeter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a\\n kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\\n The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\\n summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\\n spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\\n she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\\n pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\\n all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\\n“But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly\\n exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”\\nA step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\\n it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\\n and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\\n “Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\\n know your wishes instead of muttering them to\\n yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”\\n“Were they?” asked Lois.\\nShe and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\\n Judy was telling them without interruption.\\n“That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.\\n “There weren’t any of them impossible.”\\nAnd she went on to tell them how, the very next\\n day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\\n exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\\n of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\\n Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the\\n water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\\n had stared at them a moment and then climbed the\\n steps to the pool.\\n“Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.\\n “Is this beautiful fountain real?”\\nA voice had answered, although she could see no\\n one.\\n“Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\\n shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\\n come true.”\\n“A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a\\n tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”\\n“Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\\n surely come true,” the voice had repeated.\\n“But what is there to cry about?”\\n“You found plenty to cry about back at your\\n grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded\\n her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up\\n there in the attic?”\\n“Then you—you\\nare\\nthe fountain!” Judy remembered\\n exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It\\n doesn’t have a voice.”\\n“Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had\\n said in a mysterious whisper.\\nCHAPTER II\\nIf Wishes Came True\\n“Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\\n “Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any\\n longer. What did you wish?”\\n“Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming\\n to that.”\\nFirst, she told her friends, she had to think of a\\n wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\\n those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\\n been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\\n away.\\n“You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of\\n having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody\\n in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\\n lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\\n and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\\n little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\\n they vanished, and so I began naming the things I\\n wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were\\n wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\\n wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\\n and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to\\n think of others that my wishes started to come true.”\\n“But what were they?” Lois insisted.\\nLorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\\n Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\\n airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots\\n of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\\n G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far\\n as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\\n spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything\\n more.”\\n“Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois\\n asked.\\n“Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more\\n things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\\n pets, and have a nice home, and—”\\n“And your wishes all came true!”\\n“Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one\\n about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I\\n wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\\n seemed impossible at the time, but the future did\\n hold a sister for me.”\\n“It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing\\n Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think\\n sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”\\n“Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then\\n it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter\\n or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t\\n know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the\\n strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”\\n“Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was\\n enchanted?”\\nLois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\\n answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so\\n at the time. I wandered around, growing very\\n drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\\n it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\\n waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\\n had been a dream.”\\n“A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it\\n wasn’t a flying carpet?”\\n“No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured\\n her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a\\n beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\\n with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”\\n“All the year around?”\\nAgain Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\\n “Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long\\n way from June to December.”\\n“Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy\\n said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any\\n time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\\n and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\\n I explored the garden all around the fountain.”\\n“And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.\\n“Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream\\n you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t\\n you try to solve the mystery?”\\n“I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if\\n I had been older or more experienced. I really should\\n have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\\n secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\\n away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t\\n really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\\n for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\\n impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine\\n was your friend.”\\n“I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.\\n “It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”\\n“It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\\n the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that\\n things started happening so fast that I completely\\n forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t\\n believe I thought about it again until after we moved\\n to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\\n saw the fountain on your lawn.”\\n“The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,”\\n Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”\\n“You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve\\n seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the\\n picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll\\n show you.”\\nLois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\\n Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.\\n Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had\\n tasted it too often while she was making it.\\n“I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.\\nLois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\\n the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\\n with cream.\\n“Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks\\n he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\\n lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\\n He wants to explore the attic, too.”\\n“He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there\\n are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.\\nLeaving the table, they all started upstairs with\\n the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\\n grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s\\n tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\\n removed. But there was still a door closing off the\\n narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\\n reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\\n“He can read my mind. He always knows where\\n I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and\\n the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\\n noise came from the floor above.\\n“Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid\\n of,” Judy urged her friends.\\n“Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,”\\n confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\\n room at the top of the last flight of stairs.\\n“So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious\\n about black cats, but they are creepy. Does\\n Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”\\n“Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy.\\n Pausing at still another door that led to the darker\\n part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\\n “Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\\n care to explore the past?”\\nThe exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\\n relating still more of what she remembered about\\n the fountain.\\n“When I told Grandma about it she laughed and\\n said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\\n true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would\\n she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this\\n house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\\n you see on that high shelf by the window. I think\\n she and Grandpa like the way they lived without\\n any modern conveniences or anything.”\\n“I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the\\n old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died\\n the same winter, isn’t it?”\\n“Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\\n wished neither of them would outlive the other. If\\n they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more\\n thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes.\\n Another could have been to keep the good old days,\\n as Grandma used to call them. That one came true\\n in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\\n past when they kept all these old things. That’s what\\n I meant about turning back the clock.”\\n“If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little\\n myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things\\n were the way they used to be when I trusted\\n Arthur—”\\n“Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.\\nAfterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\\n and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\\n she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\\n through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\\n was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\\n monster coming between her and her handsome husband,\\n Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\\n seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\\n in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\\n the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It\\n is. It’s the very same one.”\\n“But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!”\\n Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”\\n“I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m\\n sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly\\n to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\\n But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\\n If she did, she pretended not to.\\n“Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love\\n to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”\\n“I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.\\n “Do you recognize it, too?”\\n“I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little\\n more closely the picture they had found. “It looks\\n like the fountain on the Brandt estate.”\\n“The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.\\n “Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\\n all the way to Farringdon.”\\n“Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The\\n Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you\\n come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”\\n“Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine\\n back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\\n to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off\\n into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.\\n “I never thought it led to a house, though. There\\n isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\\n took?”\\n“Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?”\\n Lois suggested.\\nCHAPTER III\\nA Strange Encounter\\nLorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\\n trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\\n it under one condition. They were not to drive all\\n the way to the house which, she said, was just over\\n the hilltop. They were to park the car where no\\n one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\\n“But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.\\n“You’ll remember it, won’t you?”\\nJudy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure.\\n She and Lois both argued that it would be better to\\n inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\\n“She’d be glad to show us around. This way it\\n looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they\\n started off in the blue car she was driving.\\nIt was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\\n easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\\n and said if they did find the fountain she thought\\n she’d wish for one exactly like it.\\n“Well, you know what your grandmother said\\n about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you\\n let people know about them instead of muttering\\n them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”\\n“Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know\\n about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\\n be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\\n coat he gave me last year.”\\n“Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too\\n warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\\n trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\\n as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\\nThe trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\\n had covered the distance that had seemed such a\\n long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s\\n wagon.\\n“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve\\n just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t\\n think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\\n to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\\n queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s\\n old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\\n some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t\\n explain what happened afterwards. When I woke\\n up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\\n wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”\\n“How could they?” asked Lois.\\n“Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to\\n see how beautiful everything was before—”\\nAgain she broke off as if there were something\\n she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.\\n“Before what?” questioned Judy.\\n“Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\\n were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\\n but you never did explain how you got back home,”\\n Lorraine reminded her.\\n“Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it,\\n but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember\\n driving home along this road. You see, I thought my\\n grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\\n and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\\n There wasn’t a house in sight.”\\n“The Brandt house is just over the top of this next\\n hill,” Lois put in.\\n“I know. You told me that. Now I know why I\\n couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\\n tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\\n I followed it. There’s something about a path in\\n the woods that always tempts me.”\\n“We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\\n your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”\\n“Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where\\n the hammock was and then through an archway,”\\n Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes\\n peered out at me from unexpected places. I was\\n actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\\n There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard\\n the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he\\n was driving off without me.”\\n“He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise,\\n and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like\\n that?”\\n“I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\\n and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.\\n “The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\\n them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for\\n Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”\\n“I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they\\n turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\\n“Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s\\n another car coming.”\\nAs Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\\n ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\\n Judy until the car had passed. The man driving\\n it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\\n his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\\n long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\\n most of his hair.\\n“What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois\\n when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for\\n playing hide and seek?”\\n“I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine\\n begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there\\n any more.”\\n“Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\\n can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.\\nShe was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\\n more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\\nLois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\\n road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\\n of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\\n green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\\n The sky was gray with white clouds being driven\\n across it by the wind.\\n“There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can\\n see it over to the left. It looks like something out of\\n Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”\\n“It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder\\n what it is.”\\n“I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It\\n would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But\\n if there are new people living here they’ll never give\\n us permission.”\\n“We might explore it without permission,” Judy\\n suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends\\n as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\\n road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to\\n explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for\\n the fountain.”\\n“Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It\\n won’t be enchanted. I told you—”\\n“You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If\\n you know anything about the people who live here\\n now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\\n I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”\\n“I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do\\n know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember\\n Roger Banning from school, don’t you?\\n I’ve seen him around here. His family must have\\n acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on\\n the estate.”\\n“Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you\\n tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places\\n together.”\\n“It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.\\n “I was just out for a drive.”\\n“You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a\\n car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger\\n Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better\\n than that. I did know him slightly, but not from\\n school. The boys and girls were separated and went\\n to different high schools by the time we moved to\\n Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\\n lot better. He was in our young people’s group at\\n church.”\\n“Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer\\n mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”\\n“For what?” asked Judy.\\nLike Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\\n to gossip.\\n“Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\\n his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\\n business people. I think he forged some legal\\n documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\\n It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.\\nNow Judy did remember. It was something she\\n would have preferred to forget. She liked to think\\n she was a good judge of character, and she had taken\\n Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\\n never stoop to crime.\\n“I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,”\\n Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look\\n for it, or aren’t we?”\\n“Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I\\n just like to know what a tiger looks like before he\\n springs at me,” Judy explained.\\n“You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition\\n of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.\\n“I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who\\n seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling.\\n Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve\\n seen that character who drove down this road and,\\n for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\\n Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?”\\nLorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\\n evasively, “People don’t generally enter private\\n estates without an invitation. That’s all.”\\n“I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided,\\n “in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect\\n we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\\n of trespassing.”\\n“I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two\\n dark-coated figures strode down the road toward\\n them. “You drove right by a\\n NO TRESPASSING\\n sign,\\n and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to\\n meet us!”\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see\\n and smell them with ease.\\n\\n\\n My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise\\n in front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens\\n came in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of\\n them eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre\\n beings, but there\\'s barely a species anywhere that can resist the old\\n exhibitionist urge.\\n\\n\\n \"Send them in one at a time,\" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the\\n office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to\\n begin.\\n\\n\\n The name of the planet was MacTavish IV \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mif you went by the official\\n Terran listing\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m or Ghryne \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mif you called it by what its people were\\n accustomed to calling it\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV\\n and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals\\n happy wherever I go.\\n\\n\\n Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim\\n sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had\\n saturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding\\n arrival. Stuff like this:\\nWant to visit Earth—see the Galaxy\\'s most glittering and exclusive\\n world? Want to draw good pay, work short hours, experience the thrills\\n of show business on romantic Terra? If you are a non-terrestrial,\\n there may be a place for you in the Corrigan Institute of\\n Morphological Science. No freaks wanted—normal beings only. J. F.\\n Corrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday to\\n Fifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until\\n 2937, so don\\'t miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and riches\\n can be yours!\\nBroadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand\\n languages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really\\n packs in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It\\'s the best of its kind,\\n the only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the\\n other species of the universe.\\n\\n\\n The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, \"The first\\n applicant is ready to see you, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Send him, her or it in.\"\\n\\n\\n The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on\\n nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a\\n big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and\\n five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.\\n There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,\\n one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.\\nHis voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. \"You are Mr. Corrigan?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right.\" I reached for a data blank. \"Before we begin, I\\'ll need\\n certain information about—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am a being of Regulus II,\" came the grave, booming reply, even\\n before I had picked up the blank. \"I need no special care and I am not\\n a fugitive from the law of any world.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.\"\\n\\n\\n I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick\\n cough. \"Let me have that again, please?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The \\'R\\' stands for\\n Raymond.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, that\\'s not the name you were born with.\"\\n\\n\\n The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,\\n remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of\\n an apologetic smile. \"My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and\\n shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.\"\\nThe little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.\\n \"You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You\\'ll pay\\n for my services, transportation and expenses. I\\'ll be required to\\n remain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and\\n transportation.\"\\n\\n\\n The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping\\n on one side, two on the other. \"Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I\\n accept the terms!\"\\n\\n\\n I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were\\n signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into\\n the other office to sign him up.\\n\\n\\n I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show;\\n the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him\\n didn\\'t mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien\\n who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker\\n would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get\\n to Earth. My conscience won\\'t let me really\\nexploit\\na being, but I\\n don\\'t believe in throwing money away, either.\\n\\n\\n The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit\\n has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few\\n decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was\\n followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan\\'s Planet,\\n four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple\\n of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being\\n so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at\\n anything short of top rate.\\n\\n\\n Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a\\n handout than a job. If there\\'s any species we have a real over-supply\\n of, it\\'s those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it\\n a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn\\'t even get\\n the handout he was angling for. I don\\'t approve of begging.\\n\\n\\n The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the\\n Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had\\n figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.\\nIt was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into\\n the successful proprietor of Corrigan\\'s Institute, after some years\\n as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in\\n 2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial\\n beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.\\n\\n\\n Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down,\\n a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a\\n scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.\\n\\n\\n That\\'s what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is,\\n of course. A zoo. But we don\\'t go out and hunt for our specimens; we\\n advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth\\n once in his lifetime, and there\\'s only one way he can do it.\\n\\n\\n We don\\'t keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens\\n before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms.\\n My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I\\n reach that, I\\'ll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.\\n\\n\\n After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new\\n specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids,\\n fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no\\n less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.\\n\\n\\n It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a\\n Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some\\n 400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn\\'t see\\n how we could take one on. They\\'re gentle and likable beings, but their\\n upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any\\n old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.\\n\\n\\n \"One more specimen before lunch,\" I told Stebbins, \"to make it an even\\n dozen.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long\\n close look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took\\n another one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as\\n I could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was\\n tall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and\\n though he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look\\n about him. He said, in level Terran accents, \"I\\'m looking for a job\\n with your outfit, Corrigan.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s been a mistake. We\\'re interested in non-terrestrials only.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz\\n XIII.\"\\nI don\\'t mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the line\\n at getting bilked myself. \"Look, friend, I\\'m busy, and I\\'m not known\\n for my sense of humor. Or my generosity.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not panhandling. I\\'m looking for a job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then try elsewhere. Suppose you stop wasting my time, bud. You\\'re as\\n Earthborn as I am.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,\" he said smoothly. \"I\\n happen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists\\n anywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small\\n and little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary\\n fluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don\\'t you want me in your\\n circus?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. And it\\'s not a circus. It\\'s—\"\\n\\n\\n \"A scientific institute. I stand corrected.\"\\n\\n\\n There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I\\n guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on\\n his ear without another word. Instead I played along. \"If you\\'re from\\n such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not speaking. I\\'m a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just\\n the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate\\n back to colloquial speech.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very clever, Mr. Gorb.\" I grinned at him and shook my head. \"You spin\\n a good yarn—but for my money, you\\'re really Sam Jones or Phil Smith\\n from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to\\n Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low\\n these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.\"\\n\\n\\n He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, \"You\\'re making a big\\n mistake. I\\'m just what your outfit needs. A representative of a\\n hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect!\\n Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—\"\\n\\n\\n I pulled away from his yawning mouth. \"Good-by, Mr. Gorb,\" I repeated.\\n\\n\\n \"All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn\\'t much. I\\'ll be a big\\n attraction. I\\'ll—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nGood-by, Mr. Gorb!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to\\n the door. \"I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think\\n it over. Maybe you\\'ll regret your hastiness. I\\'ll be back to give you\\n another chance.\"\\n\\n\\n He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile.\\n This was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get\\n a job!\\n\\n\\n But I wasn\\'t buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness\\n intellectually. There\\'s no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there\\'s\\n only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some\\n real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket\\n home.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that\\n reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.\\nThe first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a\\n Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I\\n had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan,\\n and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds.\\n Hardly had the \\'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the\\n Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him\\n officially.\\n\\n\\n He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high,\\n and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three\\n stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,\\n and growled, \"I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me\\n immediately to a contract.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will grant me a contract!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will you please sit down?\"\\n\\n\\n He said sulkily, \"I will remain standing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As you prefer.\" My desk has a few concealed features which are\\n sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed\\n life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of\\n trouble.\\n\\n\\n The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They\\'re hairy creatures, and\\n this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his\\n body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket\\n of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his\\n warlike race.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"You\\'ll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it\\'s not our\\n policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our\\n Institute. And we\\'re not currently in need of any Kallerian males,\\n because—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will hire me or trouble I will make!\"\\n\\n\\n I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already\\n carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.\\n\\n\\n The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. \"Yes, you have\\n four representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn!\\n For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to\\n the noble Clan Gursdrinn!\"\\n\\n\\n At the key-word\\navenge\\n, I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian\\n in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he\\n didn\\'t move. He bellowed, \"I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to\\n Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!\"\\nI\\'m a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and\\n one of the most important of those principles is that I never let\\n myself be bullied by anyone. \"I deeply regret having unintentionally\\n insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?\"\\n\\n\\n He glared at me in silence.\\n\\n\\n I went on, \"Please be assured that I\\'ll undo the insult at the earliest\\n possible opportunity. It\\'s not feasible for us to hire another\\n Kallerian now, but I\\'ll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon\\n as a vacancy—\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. You will hire me now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can\\'t be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You will rue! I will take drastic measures!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I\\'ll\\n get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another\\n Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—\"\\n\\n\\n You\\'d think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a\\n zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there\\'s always\\n the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we\\'re insulting\\n all the others.\\n\\n\\n I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and\\n Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left.\\n They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him\\n away. He wasn\\'t minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked\\n them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw,\\n but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was\\n out in the hall.\\n\\n\\n I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next\\n applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped\\n open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.\\n\\n\\n \"Come here, you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Stebbins?\" I said gently.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he\\n came running in—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please, please,\" squeaked the little alien pitifully. \"I must see you,\\n honored sir!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t his turn in line,\" Stebbins protested. \"There are at least\\n fifty ahead of him.\"\\n\"All right,\" I said tiredly. \"As long as he\\'s in here already, I might\\n as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.\"\\n\\n\\n Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.\\nThe alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking\\n creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a\\n lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His\\n tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at\\n full volume.\\n\\n\\n \"Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a\\n being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel\\n to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with\\n yourself.\"\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I\\'d better tell you right at the outset that we\\'re already\\n carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a\\n female now and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?\"\\n\\n\\n I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian\\n entry. \"Yes, that\\'s her name.\"\\n\\n\\n The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. \"It is she!\\n It is she!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid we don\\'t have room for any more—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress,\\n she is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life\\n and my love.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Funny,\" I said. \"When we signed her three years ago, she said she was\\n single. It\\'s right here on the chart.\"\\n\\n\\n \"She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors\\n of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry,\\n languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You\\nmust\\ntake me to\\n Earth!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must\\n reason with her. Earthman, can\\'t you see I must appeal to her inner\\n flame?\\nI must bring her back!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n My face was expressionless. \"You don\\'t really intend to join our\\n organization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes!\" wailed the Stortulian. \"Find some other member of my race,\\n if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead\\n lump of stone?\"\\nIt isn\\'t, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by\\n sentiment. I felt sorry for this being\\'s domestic troubles, but I\\n wasn\\'t going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel\\n happy—not to mention footing the transportation.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I don\\'t see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict\\n on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for\\n scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in\\n coming isn\\'t scientific, I can\\'t in all conscience\\nlie\\nfor you, can\\n I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not.\" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right\\n along. \"Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up,\\n I might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your\\n heart to me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought the truth would move you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It did. But in effect you\\'re now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent\\n criminal act. Friend, I can\\'t do it. My reputation means too much to\\n me,\" I said piously.\\n\\n\\n \"Then you will refuse me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can\\'t take you to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?\"\\n\\n\\n There\\'s a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an\\n unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of\\n scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the\\n undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn\\'t pull a low\\n trick like that on our female Stortulian.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"I\\'ll ask her about coming home. But I won\\'t ship her back\\n against her will. And maybe she\\'s happier where she is.\"\\n\\n\\n The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask\\n his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a\\n living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, \"There is no hope then. All\\n is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.\"\\n\\n\\n He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping.\\n I watched him shuffle out. I do have\\nsome\\nconscience, and I had the\\n uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to\\n commit suicide on my account.\\nAbout fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life\\n started to get complicated again.\\n\\n\\n Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason\\n or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the\\n day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.\\n\\n\\n I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian\\'s\\n outraged pride and the Stortulian\\'s flighty wife when the door opened\\n and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII\\n stepped in.\\n\\n\\n \"How did\\nyou\\nget in here?\" I demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,\" he said cheerily.\\n \"Change your mind about me yet?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get out before I have you thrown out.\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb shrugged. \"I figured you hadn\\'t changed your mind, so I\\'ve changed\\n my pitch a bit. If you won\\'t believe I\\'m from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I\\n tell you that I\\nam\\nEarthborn, and that I\\'m looking for a job on your\\n staff.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t care\\nwhat\\nyour story is! Get out or—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—you\\'ll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second.\\n Corrigan, you\\'re no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours\\n outside\\nis\\n. He doesn\\'t know how to handle alien beings. How many\\n times today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?\"\\n\\n\\n I scowled at him. \"Too damn many.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You see? He\\'s incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead.\\n I\\'ve been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to\\n know about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.\"\\n\\n\\n I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of\\n the office before I spoke. \"Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is,\\n I\\'ve had a hard day. There\\'s been a Kallerian in here who just about\\n threatened murder, and there\\'s been a Stortulian in here who\\'s about\\n to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it\\'s troubling\\n me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and\\n go home to Earth. I don\\'t want you hanging around here bothering me.\\n I\\'m not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to\\n claiming you\\'re an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is\\n that I\\'m not looking for any of\\nthose\\neither. Now will you scram or—\"\\n\\n\\n The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian,\\n came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering\\n metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding\\n a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came\\n dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry, Chief,\" Stebbins gasped. \"I tried to keep him out, but—\"\\n\\n\\n Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out\\n with a roar. \"Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!\"\\nSitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to\\n let him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\\n\\n\\n Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have\\n notified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the\\n death of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He\\'s going to—\"\\n\\n\\n An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun\\n trigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it\\n savagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the\\n sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of\\n bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\\n\\n\\n Before I could react to the big life-form\\'s hara-kiri, the office door\\n flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\\n green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\\n at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\\n\\n\\n \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Y-yes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint\\n being—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the\\n untimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of\\n the Ghrynian policemen.\\n\\n\\n \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver\\n of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several\\n minutes ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest\\n you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\\n $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the\\n Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and\\nI\\'m\\nresponsible?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\\n this late life-form\\'s request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, no, but—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\\nClosing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them\\n away. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was\\n going to put an awful dent in this year\\'s take. And I shuddered when I\\n remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to\\n come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000\\n per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.\\n\\n\\n I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced\\n arrival.\\n\\n\\n The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway\\n and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian\\n policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a\\n moment and turned to eye the newcomer.\\n\\n\\n I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I\\n resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I\\ndid\\ncome, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against\\n crackpots.\\n\\n\\n In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer\\n worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me\\n to do.\"\\n\\n\\n I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers\\n going down the drain. \"Stop him, somebody! He\\'s going to kill himself!\\n He\\'s—\"\\n\\n\\n Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me\\n flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the\\n meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I\\n guess I wasn\\'t fully aware of what was going on.\\n\\n\\n Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole\\n in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I\\n saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The\\n man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting\\n himself off.\\n\\n\\n He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that\\n Stortulian wasn\\'t here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying\\n fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed\\n plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the\\n struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.\\n\\n\\n \"Evidently you don\\'t know as much as you think you do about Stortulian\\n psychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely\\n abhorrent to them. When they\\'re troubled, they kill the person who\\n caused their trouble. In this case, you.\"\\nI began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a\\n full-bodied laugh.\\n\\n\\n \"Funny,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"What is?\" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.\\n\\n\\n \"These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and\\n killed\\nhimself\\n, and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and\\n pathetic damn near blew my head off.\" I shuddered. \"Thanks for the\\n tackle job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t mention it,\" Gorb said.\\n\\n\\n I glared at the Ghrynian police. \"Well? What are you waiting for? Take\\n that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn\\'t murder against the\\n local laws?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Stortulian will be duly punished,\" replied the leader of the\\n Ghrynian cops calmly. \"But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian\\n and the fine of—\"\\n\\n\\n \"—one hundred thousand dollars. I know.\" I groaned and turned to\\n Stebbins. \"Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them\\n send down a legal adviser. Find out if there\\'s any way we can get out\\n of this mess with our skins intact.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right, Chief.\" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.\\n\\n\\n Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it,\" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. \"The Consulate can\\'t help\\n you. I can.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You?\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"I can get you out of this cheap.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nHow\\ncheap?\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb grinned rakishly. \"Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a\\n specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That\\'s a heck of a\\n lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn\\'t\\n be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they\\n were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials\\n ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand,\\n giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell you what,\" I said finally. \"You\\'ve got yourself a deal—but on\\n a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you\\'ll have five grand and\\n the contract. Otherwise, nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n Gorb shrugged. \"What have I to lose?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

The annoyance was that\\n \\nhe had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!\\nThe man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did\\n the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in\\n the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\\n\\n\\n Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the\\n humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and\\n arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior\\n to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was\\n accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was\\n almost ordinary-looking.\\n\\n\\n As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely\\n amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably\\n hideous.\\n\\n\\n Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a\\n short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were\\n in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though\\n not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic\\n surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.\\n\\n\\n The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his\\n clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather\\n ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt\\n he was, which was what mattered.\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me\\n buy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the\\n same for my fellow-man here.\"\\n\\n\\n The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth\\n hastily supplied by the management.\\n\\n\\n \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out\\n his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look\\n at them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\"\\nYou could use one\\nwas implied.\\n\\n\\n And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard\\'s spectacular appearance,\\n was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just\\n set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard\\'s\\n handsome face.\\nSuddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. \"Don\\'t do that,\" the\\n nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed\\n the glass from the little man\\'s slackening grasp. \"You wouldn\\'t want to\\n go to jail because of him.\"\\n\\n\\n The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces\\n now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too\\n strong, he stumbled off. He hadn\\'t really wanted to fight, only to\\n smash back, and now it was too late for that.\\n\\n\\n Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. \"So, it\\'s you again?\"\\n\\n\\n The man in the gray suit smiled. \"Who else in any world would stand up\\n for you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I should think you\\'d have given up by now. Not that I mind having you\\n around, of course,\" Gabriel added too quickly. \"You do come in useful\\n at times, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So you don\\'t mind having me around?\" The nondescript man smiled again.\\n \"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can\\'t be running from\\n yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?\"\\n\\n\\n Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. \"Come on, have a drink\\n with me, fellow-man, and let\\'s let bygones be bygones. I owe you\\n something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I drank with you once too often,\" the nondescript man said. \"And\\n things worked out fine, didn\\'t they? For you.\" His eyes studied the\\n other man\\'s incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of\\n bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were\\n not pleased with what they saw. \"Watch yourself, colleague,\" he warned\\n as he left. \"Soon you might not be worth the saving.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who was that, Gabe?\" the girl asked.\\n\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I never saw him before in my life.\" Of course, knowing\\n him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he\\n happened to have been telling the truth.\\nOnce the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard\\'s hotel\\n suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\\n he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\\n that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\\n coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\\n reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\\n the letter combination\\nbodyguard\\n, he went out into the street.\\n\\n\\n If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\\n been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\\n identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\\n years.\\n\\n\\n The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\\n the driver asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\\n\\n\\n But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\\n wanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\\n\\n\\n The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\\n teleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don\\'t you commit\\n suicide? It\\'s cleaner and quicker.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\\n smile. \"Bet you\\'ve never tried the game yourself. Each time it\\n happens, there\\'s a ... well, there\\'s no experience to match it at a\\n thrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\\n which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\\n\\n\\n \"Each time, eh? You\\'re a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\\n window. \"If it wasn\\'t for the nibble, I\\'d throw you right out of the\\n cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\\n anybody with any legitimate feelings hates \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\\n commission, wouldn\\'t it?\" the other man asked coolly.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. You\\'ll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\\nII\\n\\n\\n It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\\n condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\\n\\n\\n \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\\n shook his handsome head.\\n\\n\\n \"Show you I can do something \\'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\\n referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\\n and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\\n\\n\\n Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\\n when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\\n town, they didn\\'t have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\\n on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\\n short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\\n\\n\\n To the girl\\'s indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\\n the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\\n young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren\\'t there\\n at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\\n remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\\n before the fuel tank exploded and the \\'copter went up in flames.\\n\\n\\n Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\\n speculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled—shock had sobered him\\n a little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I\\'m not hurt or you\\'d have\\n thrown me back in.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And that\\'s no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\\n\\n\\n The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\\n that he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\\n glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nMrs.\\n,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\\n Lockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\\n \"Pretty bauble, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\\n looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\\n from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\\n you\\'ll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\\n car flickered on his face and Gabriel\\'s and, she supposed, hers too.\\n Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\\n\\n\\n There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the\\n lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\\n newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\\n beginning to slide downhill....\\n\\n\\n Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\\nThere was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,\\n which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and\\n his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket\\n closer about her chilly body. \"Aren\\'t you going to introduce your—your\\n friend to me, Gabe?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he\\'s\\n no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification\\n card from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I\\'m Dominic Bianchi, and\\n Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn\\'t a retail\\n milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks\\n ago, and now he isn\\'t ... anything.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I\\'d like to give you some token\\n of my—of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier\\n with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only\\n casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation\\n held little gratitude.\\n\\n\\n The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money,\\n thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\\n \"if you get up, I\\'ll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the\\n future! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let\\n something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\\n\\n\\n Gabriel shivered. \"I\\'ll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise—I\\'ll be\\n careful.\"\\nWhen he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,\\n the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi\\n driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the\\n commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others\\n had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate\\n or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known\\n colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from\\n one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you\\n could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it\\n extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.\\n Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn\\'t care.\\n\\n\\n Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were\\n many legitimate citizens who weren\\'t quite sure just what the word\\n implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so\\n deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\\n \"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to\\n zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly\\n applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as\\n nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;\\n otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.\\nPlaying the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it\\n profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair\\'s\\n seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\\n human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\\n interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\\n slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\\n zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\\n Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been\\n big money in musical chairs as such.\\n\\n\\n When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as\\n they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\\n law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\\n could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\\n spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\\n punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\\n terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\\n could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\\n after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\\n trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\\n Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\\n of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\\n\\n\\n The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\\n which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\\n conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\\n But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\\n of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\\n light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\\n the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting\\n involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\\n\\n\\n The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\\n when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\\n darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\\n have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\\n everybody else far too well.\\n\\n\\n The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry\\'s motive in\\n coming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually\\n disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\\n too logical for the man he was haunting.\\n\\n\\n However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\\n heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\\n creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\\n\\n\\n \"One,\" the fat man answered.\\nIII\\n\\n\\n The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\\n from the stranger\\'s gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\\n patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\\n features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\\n Gabriel Lockard\\'s form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\\n weighted out,\" he muttered, \"he\\'ll be all right. Whatever possessed you\\n two to come out to a place like this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I really think Gabriel\\nmust\\nbe possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\\n to herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\\n until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\\n It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\\n growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\\n them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\\n and it wasn\\'t worth the trouble of fixing up.\\n\\n\\n The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\\nare\\nthe\\n same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren\\'t you? And before\\n that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\\n\\n\\n The young man\\'s cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I\\'m all of\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\\n who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?\" Automatically she\\n reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\\n hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\\n been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\\nHe smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.\\n\\n\\n \"But why do you do it?\\nWhy!\\nDo you like it? Or is it because of\\n Gabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here\\n and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was\\n included in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;\\n is that it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ask him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He won\\'t tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I\\n didn\\'t recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that\\'s what\\n we\\'ve been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I\\n think?\"\\n\\n\\n There was no change of expression on the man\\'s gaunt face, and she\\n wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or\\n third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it\\n respond? What was it like to step into another person\\'s casing? But she\\n must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking\\n for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,\\n she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so\\n casually.\\nIt was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her\\n husband\\'s immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from\\n some animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about\\n herself. The thin young man began to cough again.\\n\\n\\n Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk\\n of the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships\\n embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow\\n she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a\\n barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who\\n followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of\\n them would stay....\\n\\n\\n \"If you\\'re after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then\\n do you keep helping him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am not helping\\nhim\\n. And he knows that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll change again tonight, won\\'t you?\" she babbled. \"You always\\n change after you ... meet us? I think I\\'m beginning to be able to\\n identify you now, even when you\\'re ... wearing a new body; there\\'s\\n something about you that doesn\\'t change.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed\\n him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out\\n from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice\\n less impersonal, \"for your sake.\"\\n\\n\\n She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but\\n she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an\\n outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had\\n known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect\\n that he was even more closely involved than that.\\n\\n\\n \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the\\n subject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the\\n risk of getting a bad one?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This isn\\'t a good body,\" he said. \"It\\'s diseased. Sure, nobody\\'s\\n supposed to play the game who hasn\\'t passed a thorough medical\\n examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading\\n me, they\\'re often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty\\n of foliage.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How—long will it last you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Four or five months, if I\\'m careful.\" He smiled. \"But don\\'t worry, if\\n that\\'s what you\\'re doing; I\\'ll get it passed on before then. It\\'ll be\\n expensive—that\\'s all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then\\n it was tough on me too, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why\\n are you doing it?\" People didn\\'t have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard\\n for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should\\n know him better than most.\\n\\n\\n \"Ask your husband.\"\\n\\n\\n The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,\\n snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,\\n and stirred it with his toe. \"I\\'d better call a cab—he might freeze to\\n death.\"\\n\\n\\n He signaled and a cab came.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver\\n lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I\\'m\\n getting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.\\n \"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn\\'t,\\n in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\"\\n\"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect\\n except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I\\'m afraid you\\n cannot play.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.\\n\\n\\n \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz\\n shrugged. \"I\\'ll pay you twice the regular fee.\"\\n\\n\\n The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This\\n game is really clean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In a town like this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz\\' tendrils\\n quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through\\n long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His\\n heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been\\n velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung\\n with him.\\n\\n\\n \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole\\n set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by\\n no means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don\\'t you try another\\n town where they\\'re not so particular?\"\\n\\n\\n The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.\\n He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.\\n And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he\\n wouldn\\'t feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was\\n he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own\\n discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact\\n that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?\\n Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the\\n hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day\\n win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original\\n casing had?\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he\\n would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl,\\n seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened\\n and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that\\n the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn\\'t understand\\n how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of\\n information.\\nThe Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they\\n detached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it\\n happens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions\\n to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good\\n health.\"\\n\\n\\n The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured\\n aloud. \"A criminal then.\"\\n\\n\\n The green one\\'s face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.\\n\\n\\n \"Male?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate\\n standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the\\n curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it\\n kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had\\n also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials\\n exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or\\n biological impossibility, no one could tell.\\n\\n\\n It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz\\' part—if it had ever\\n been proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body,\\n Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held\\n its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite\\n being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had\\n been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on\\n Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,\\n \"Don\\'t beat \\'em; cheat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take\\n such a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thirty thousand credits.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, that\\'s three times the usual rate!\"\\n\\n\\n \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific\\n risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he\\n himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all\\n the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.\\nHe looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;\\n tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to\\n match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many\\n people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the\\n pockets, but it wasn\\'t necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it\\n was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\\n student of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\\n time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\\n might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\\n the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though\\n not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the\\n police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital\\n punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the\\n man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,\\n nor whom the police intended to capture easily.\\nThis might be a lucky break for me after all\\n, the new tenant thought,\\n as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious\\n rude health, was not a very comfortable fit.\\nI can do a lot with a\\n hulk like this. And maybe I\\'m cleverer than the original owner; maybe\\n I\\'ll be able to get away with it.\\nIV\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don\\'t try to fool me! I know you\\n too well. And I know you have that man\\'s—the real Gabriel\\n Lockard\\'s—body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she\\n watched her husband\\'s reflection in the dressing table mirror.\\n\\n\\n Lockard—Lockard\\'s body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven\\n chin. \"That what he tell you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, he didn\\'t tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you\\n whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he\\n obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn\\'t want to\\n see his body spoiled.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\nis\\na pretty good body, isn\\'t it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles\\n and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved\\n at having someone with whom to share his secret.\\n\\n\\n \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking\\n at him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you\\'re coursing.\\n Gabe, why don\\'t you...?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.\\n \"You\\'d like that, wouldn\\'t you? You\\'d be\\nhis\\nwife then. That would be\\n nice—a sound mind in a sound body. But don\\'t you think that\\'s a little\\n more than you deserve?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wasn\\'t thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for\\n she hadn\\'t followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I\\'d\\n go with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ...\\n old body back.\"\\nSure\\n, she thought,\\nI\\'d keep going with you to farjeen houses and\\n thrill-mills.\\nActually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only\\n once, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go\\n with him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash\\n that experience from her mind or her body.\\n\\n\\n \"You wouldn\\'t be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\"\\n she went on. \"You don\\'t know where it\\'s gone, and neither, I suppose,\\n does he?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn\\'t want it if I could get\\n it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he\\n looked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.\\n \"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can\\'t imagine what a\\n hulk I had!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to\\n match your character. Pity you could only change one.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

I\\'m not your father\\'s ghost, even if I do look a bit\\n like him. But it\\'s a longish story, and you might as well let me in.\\n You will, you know, so why quibble about it? At least, you always\\n have ... or do ... or will. I don\\'t know, verbs get all mixed up. We\\n don\\'t have the right attitude toward tenses for a situation like this.\\n\\n\\n Anyhow, you\\'ll let me in. I did, so you will.\\n\\n\\n Thanks. You think you\\'re crazy, of course, but you\\'ll find out you\\n aren\\'t. It\\'s just that things are a bit confused. And don\\'t look at the\\n machine out there too long—until you get used to it, you\\'ll find it\\'s\\n hard on the eyes, trying to follow where the vanes go. You\\'ll get used\\n to it, of course, but it will take about thirty years.\\n\\n\\n You\\'re wondering whether to give me a drink, as I remember it. Why not?\\n And naturally, since we have the same tastes, you can make the same for\\n me as you\\'re having. Of course we have the same tastes—we\\'re the same\\n person. I\\'m you thirty years from now, or you\\'re me. I remember just\\n how you feel; I felt the same way when he—that is, of course, I or\\n we—came back to tell me about it, thirty years ago.\\n\\n\\n Here, have one of these. You\\'ll get to like them in a couple more\\n years. And you can look at the revenue stamp date, if you still doubt\\n my story. You\\'ll believe it eventually, though, so it doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\n\\n Right now, you\\'re shocked. It\\'s a real wrench when a man meets himself\\n for the first time. Some kind of telepathy seems to work between two\\n of the same people. You\\nsense\\nthings. So I\\'ll simply go ahead talking\\n for half an hour or so, until you get over it. After that you\\'ll come\\n along with me. You know, I could try to change things around by telling\\n what happened to me; but he—I—told me what I was going to do, so I\\n might as well do the same. I probably couldn\\'t help telling you the\\n same thing in the same words, even if I tried—and I don\\'t intend to\\n try. I\\'ve gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.\\n\\n\\n So let\\'s begin when you get up in half an hour and come out with me.\\n You\\'ll take a closer look at the machine, then. Yes, it\\'ll be pretty\\n obvious it must be a time machine. You\\'ll sense that, too. You\\'ve seen\\n it, just a small little cage with two seats, a luggage compartment, and\\n a few buttons on a dash. You\\'ll be puzzling over what I\\'ll tell you,\\n and you\\'ll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes\\n atomic power practical. Jerome Boell, just a plain engineer, the man\\n who put atomic power in every home. You won\\'t exactly believe it, but\\n you\\'ll want to go along.\\nI\\'ll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going. So I\\n cut off your questions, and get you inside. I snap on a green button,\\n and everything seems to cut off around us. You can see a sort of\\n foggy nothing surrounding the cockpit; it is probably the field that\\n prevents passage through time from affecting us. The luggage section\\n isn\\'t protected, though.\\nYou start to say something, but by then I\\'m pressing a black button,\\n and everything outside will disappear. You look for your house, but\\n it isn\\'t there. There is exactly nothing there—in fact, there is no\\nthere\\n. You are completely outside of time and space, as best you can\\n guess how things are.\\n\\n\\n You can\\'t feel any motion, of course. You try to reach a hand out\\n through the field into the nothing around you and your hand goes out,\\n all right, but nothing happens. Where the screen ends, your hand just\\n turns over and pokes back at you. Doesn\\'t hurt, and when you pull your\\n arm back, you\\'re still sound and uninjured. But it looks frightening\\n and you don\\'t try it again.\\n\\n\\n Then it comes to you slowly that you\\'re actually traveling in time.\\n You turn to me, getting used to the idea. \"So this is the fourth\\n dimension?\" you ask.\\n\\n\\n Then you feel silly, because you\\'ll remember that I said you\\'d ask\\n that. Well, I asked it after I was told, then I came back and told it\\n to you, and I still can\\'t help answering when you speak.\\n\\n\\n \"Not exactly,\" I try to explain. \"Maybe it\\'s no dimension—or it might\\n be the fifth; if you\\'re going to skip over the so-called fourth without\\n traveling along it, you\\'d need a fifth. Don\\'t ask me. I didn\\'t invent\\n the machine and I don\\'t understand it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But....\"\\n\\n\\n I let it go, and so do you. If you don\\'t, it\\'s a good way of going\\n crazy. You\\'ll see later why I couldn\\'t have invented the machine. Of\\n course, there may have been a start for all this once. There may have\\n been a time when you did invent the machine—the atomic motor first,\\n then the time-machine. And when you closed the loop by going back and\\n saving yourself the trouble, it got all tangled up. I figured out once\\n that such a universe would need some seven or eight time and space\\n dimensions. It\\'s simpler just to figure that this is the way time got\\n bent back on itself. Maybe there is no machine, and it\\'s just easier\\n for us to imagine it. When you spend thirty years thinking about it, as\\n I did—and you will—you get further and further from an answer.\\n\\n\\n Anyhow, you sit there, watching nothing all around you, and no time,\\n apparently, though there is a time effect back in the luggage space.\\n You look at your watch and it\\'s still running. That means you either\\n carry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small\\n increment of time from the main field. I don\\'t know, and you won\\'t\\n think about that then, either.\\nI\\'m smoking, and so are you, and the air in the machine is getting a\\n bit stale. You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide\\n open, yet you haven\\'t seen any effects of air loss.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are we getting our air?\" you ask. \"Or why don\\'t we lose it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No place for it to go,\" I explain. There isn\\'t. Out there is neither\\n time nor space, apparently. How could the air leak out? You still feel\\n gravity, but I can\\'t explain that, either. Maybe the machine has a\\n gravity field built in, or maybe the time that makes your watch run is\\n responsible for gravity. In spite of Einstein, you have always had the\\n idea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.\\n\\n\\n Then the machine stops—at least, the field around us cuts off. You\\n feel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe\\n easier, though we\\'re in complete darkness, except for the weak light in\\n the machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement\\n floor around. You take another cigaret from me and you get out of the\\n machine, just as I do.\\n\\n\\n I\\'ve got a bundle of clothes and I start changing. It\\'s a sort\\n of simple, short-limbed, one-piece affair I put on, but it feels\\n comfortable.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m staying here,\" I tell you. \"This is like the things they wear in\\n this century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to\\n pass fairly well. I\\'ve had all my fortune—the one you make on that\\n atomic generator—invested in such a way I can get it on using some\\n identification I\\'ve got with me, so I\\'ll do all right. I know they\\n still use some kind of money, you\\'ll see evidence of that. And it\\'s a\\n pretty easygoing civilization, from what I could see. We\\'ll go up and\\n I\\'ll leave you. I like the looks of things here, so I won\\'t be coming\\n back with you.\"\\n\\n\\n You nod, remembering I\\'ve told you about it. \"What century is this,\\n anyway?\"\\n\\n\\n I\\'d told you that, too, but you\\'ve forgotten. \"As near as I can guess,\\n it\\'s about 2150. He told me, just as I\\'m telling you, that it\\'s an\\n interstellar civilization.\"\\n\\n\\n You take another cigaret from me, and follow me. I\\'ve got a small\\n flashlight and we grope through a pile of rubbish, out into a corridor.\\n This is a sub-sub-sub-basement. We have to walk up a flight of stairs,\\n and there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.\\n\\n\\n \"What about the time machine?\" you ask.\\n\\n\\n \"Since nobody ever stole it, it\\'s safe.\"\\nWe get in the elevator, and I say \"first\" to it. It gives out a\\n coughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us. There\\'s\\n no feeling of acceleration—some kind of false gravity they use in the\\n future. Then the door opens, and the elevator says \"first\" back at us.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s obviously a service elevator and we\\'re in a dim corridor, with\\n nobody around. I grab your hand and shake it. \"You go that way. Don\\'t\\n worry about getting lost; you never did, so you can\\'t. Find the museum,\\n grab the motor, and get out. And good luck to you.\"\\n\\n\\n You act as if you\\'re dreaming, though you can\\'t believe it\\'s a dream.\\n You nod at me and I move out into the main corridor. A second later,\\n you see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward\\n a restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening. I\\'m asking\\n questions of a man, who points, and I turn and move off.\\n\\n\\n You come out of the side corridor and go down a hall, away from the\\n restaurant. There are quiet little signs along the hall. You look at\\n them, realizing for the first time that things have changed.\\nSteij:neri, Faunten, Z:rgat Dispenseri.\\nThe signs are very quiet and\\n dignified. Some of them can be decoded to stationery shops, fountains,\\n and the like. What a zergot is, you don\\'t know. You stop at a sign\\n that announces:\\nTrav:l Biwrou—F:rst-Clas Twrz—Marz, Viin*s, and\\n x: Trouj:n Planets. Spej:l reits tu aol s*nz wixin 60 lyt iirz!\\nBut\\n there is only a single picture of a dull-looking metal sphere, with\\n passengers moving up a ramp, and the office is closed. You begin to get\\n the hang of the spelling they use, though.\\n\\n\\n Now there are people around you, but nobody pays much attention to you.\\n Why should they? You wouldn\\'t care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin\\n suit; you\\'d figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well,\\n people don\\'t change much.\\n\\n\\n You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might\\n be papers on tapes.\\n\\n\\n \"Where can I find the Museum of Science?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,\" he tells you. Around\\n you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using\\n stuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\n You go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface\\n of the walk:\\nMiuzi:m *v Syens\\n. There\\'s an arrow pointing and you turn\\n left. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with\\n faint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building\\n lower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the\\n maximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the\\n information that it is the museum.\\nYou go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You\\n hesitate for a moment, then. You\\'re beginning to think the whole affair\\n is complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and\\n go home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs\\n in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other\\n guard.\\n\\n\\n What\\'s more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort\\n of drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it\\'s rather\\n pleasant.\\n\\n\\n \"Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in \\'Atoms and\\n Axioms.\\' The museum\\'s closed, but I\\'ll be glad to let you study\\n whatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce\\n guards as polite as that. \"I—I\\'m told I should investigate your\\n display of atomic generators.\"\\n\\n\\n He beams at that. \"Of course.\" The gate is swung to behind you, but\\n obviously he isn\\'t locking it. In fact, there doesn\\'t seem to be a\\n lock. \"Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight\\n of stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We\\'ve got\\n the original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using\\n them to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could\\n not explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though.\\n Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It\\'s quite a\\n hobby with me, sir. I\\'ve read everything I could get on the period.\\n Oh—congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our\\n oldest tapes.\"\\n\\n\\n You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building\\n seems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There\\'s a room on your\\n right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly\\n plastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it\\n goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row\\n of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny\\n toward you.\\n\\n\\n \"Souvenir,\" it announces in a well-modulated voice. \"This is a typical\\n gem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known\\n technically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats\\n in size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during\\n morning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child,\\n press the red button for the number of stones you desire.\"\\n\\n\\n You put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the\\n corridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of\\n spaceships—from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is\\n labeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with\\n miniature manikins—are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then\\n there is one labeled\\nWep:nz\\n, filled with everything from a crossbow\\n to a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil,\\n marked\\nFynal Hand Arm\\n. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big\\n place that bears a sign,\\nMad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez\\n.\\nBy that time, you\\'re almost convinced. And you\\'ve been doing a lot of\\n thinking about what you can do. The story I\\'m telling has been sinking\\n in, but you aren\\'t completely willing to accept it.\\n\\n\\n You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they\\'re a\\n lot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order,\\n and the latest one, marked\\n2147—Rincs Dyn*pat:\\n, is about the size\\n of a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier,\\n but with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign\\n on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining\\n that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically\\n final form.\\n\\n\\n You study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving\\n his name. Either they don\\'t know it, or they take it for granted that\\n everyone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the\\n fact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator\\n built, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation,\\n and full patent application.\\n\\n\\n They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel,\\n producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any\\n chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles,\\n and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being\\n fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the\\n outputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being\\n investigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the\\n addition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added\\n since the original.\\n\\n\\n So you go to the end and look over the thing. It\\'s simply a square box\\n with a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top,\\n plus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling,\\nDrop BBs or wire\\n here\\n. Apparently that\\'s the way it\\'s fueled. It\\'s about one foot on\\n each side.\\n\\n\\n \"Nice,\" the guard says over your shoulder. \"It finally wore out one of\\n the cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it\\'s exactly\\n as the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever.\\n Like to have me tell you about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not particularly,\" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be\\n conspicuous here. While you\\'re searching for an answer, the guard pulls\\n something out of his pocket and stares at it.\\n\\n\\n \"Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba—Centaurian, you know—is\\n arriving, but I\\'ll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine\\n some of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared\\n to nineteenth century man. You\\'ll pardon me?\"\\n\\n\\n You pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up\\n to the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it\\n transliterates to. That\\'s small and you can carry it. But the darned\\n thing is absolutely fixed. You can\\'t see any bolts, but you can\\'t budge\\n it, either.\\nYou work down the line. It\\'d be foolish to take the early model if you\\n can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals—Ehrenhaft or\\n some other principle?—and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But\\n they\\'re all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.\\n\\n\\n And, finally, you\\'re right back beside the original first model. It\\'s\\n probably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it\\n moves. There\\'s a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn\\'t touch\\n it, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.\\n\\n\\n Well, you won\\'t be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I\\n haven\\'t told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing.\\n You lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be\\n carried.\\n\\n\\n You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact,\\n if you\\'d stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time\\n machine out there now, you\\'d hear what I\\'m saying and know what will\\n happen to you. But of course, just as I did, you\\'re going to miss a\\n lot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But\\n maybe some of it helps. I\\'ve tried to remember how much I remembered,\\n after he told me, but I can\\'t be sure. So I\\'ll keep on talking. I\\n probably can\\'t help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.\\n\\n\\n Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all\\n seems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend\\n down and try to scurry past, but you know you\\'re in full view. Nothing\\n happens, though.\\n\\n\\n You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the\\n world on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate\\n is closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe\\n a quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.\\n\\n\\n Then there\\'s a yell behind you. You don\\'t wait. You put one leg in\\n front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past\\n people, who stare at you with expressions you haven\\'t time to see.\\n There\\'s another yell behind you.\\n\\n\\n Something goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front\\n of your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don\\'t wait to find out\\n about that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you\\n dart past.\\nThe street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms\\n seeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting\\n heavier at every step.\\n\\n\\n Out of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and\\n on the beefy side appears—and the badge hasn\\'t changed much. The cop\\n catches your arm and you know you\\'re not going to get away, so you stop.\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,\" the cop\\n says. \"There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let\\n me grab you a taxi.\"\\nReaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake\\n your head and come up for air.\\n\\n\\n \"I—I left my money home,\" you begin.\\n\\n\\n The cop nods. \"Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won\\'t have to give you\\n an appearance schedule. But you should have come to me.\" He reaches\\n out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. \"Sir, an emergency\\n request. Would you help this gentleman?\"\\nThe pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. \"How far?\"\\n\\n\\n You did notice the name of the building from which you came and you\\n mutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other\\n side of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him.\\n Pedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the\\n street at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming\\n at you both.\\n\\n\\n That way, it isn\\'t so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might\\n like to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation\\n here doesn\\'t look too good. The guard can get the same and be there\\n before you.\\n\\n\\n And he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach\\n it. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod\\n at him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some\\n dinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too\\n dissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.\\n\\n\\n \"You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,\" he says.\\n \"They go with the generator—we don\\'t like to have them separated. A\\n good thing I knew the production office of \\'Atoms and Axioms\\' was in\\n this building. Just let us know when you\\'re finished with the model and\\n we\\'ll pick it up.\"\\n\\n\\n You swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and\\n take the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps\\n you for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems\\n to satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction\\n and heads back to the museum.\\n\\n\\n You still don\\'t believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and\\n the information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator.\\n There is no button on it. In fact, there\\'s no door there.\\n\\n\\n You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is\\n right. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.\\nThen there\\'s a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It\\n forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in,\\n gulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how\\n a machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What\\n the deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has\\n closed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you\\'re at\\n the original level. You get out—and realize you don\\'t have a light.\\n\\n\\n You\\'ll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back\\n in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering\\n here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then\\n a shred of dim light appears; it\\'s the weak light in the time machine.\\n\\n\\n You\\'ve located it.\\n\\n\\n You put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers\\n down beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You\\n reach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There\\'s a red one\\n beside it and you finally decide on that.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly, there\\'s a confused yell from the direction of the elevator\\n and a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating\\n it. Your finger touches the red button.\\n\\n\\n You\\'ll never know what the shouting was about—whether they finally\\n doped out the fact that they\\'d been robbed, or whether they were trying\\n to help you. You don\\'t care which it is. The field springs up around\\n you and the next button you touch—the one on the board that hasn\\'t\\n been used so far—sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of\\n light, you can\\'t hear a thing, and you\\'re safe.\\n\\n\\n It isn\\'t much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your\\n nerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with\\n some pencil marks over them—\"Press these to return to yourself 30\\n years\"—and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn\\'t\\n because there is only one of you this time.\\n\\n\\n Instead, everything flashes off and you\\'re sitting in the machine in\\n your own back yard.\\n\\n\\n You\\'ll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the\\n machine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement,\\n land in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up\\n yourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then,\\n you don\\'t care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic\\n generator and taking it inside.\\nIt isn\\'t hard to disassemble, but you don\\'t learn a thing; just some\\n plates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends—all\\n things that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals.\\n But when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice\\n something.\\n\\n\\n Everything in it is brand-new and there\\'s one set of copper wires\\n missing! It won\\'t work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like\\n the set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.\\n\\n\\n And with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you\\n get just that. You don\\'t need the power company any more. And you\\n feel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn\\'t\\n insulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward\\n in time, somehow, and is back to its original youth—minus the\\n replaced wires the guard mentioned—which probably wore out because of\\n the makeshift job you\\'ve just done.\\n\\n\\n But you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are\\n all in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and\\n that the date of the patent application is 1951.\\n\\n\\n It will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the\\n future and bring it back to the past—your present—so that it can be\\n put in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be\\n the inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to\\n yourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to\\n yourself....\\n\\n\\n Who invented what? And who built which?\\n\\n\\n Before long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little\\n kids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed\\n history and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to\\n be anything but a democracy and a peaceful one—after some of the\\n worst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as\\n common as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital\\n letter.\\n\\n\\n But you\\'re thinking of the puzzle. You can\\'t find any answer.\\n\\n\\n One day you come across an old poem—something about some folks\\n calling it evolution and others calling it God. You go out, make a few\\n provisions for the future, and come back to climb into the time machine\\n that\\'s waiting in the building you had put around it. Then you\\'ll be\\n knocking on your own door, thirty years back—or right now, from your\\n view—and telling your younger self all these things I\\'m telling you.\\n\\n\\n But now....\\n\\n\\n Well, the drinks are finished. You\\'re woozy enough to go along with me\\n without protest, and I want to find out just why those people up there\\n came looking for you and shouting, before the time machine left.\\n\\n\\n Let\\'s go.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Nourse\\nJAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\\n a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\\n had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\\n were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\\n had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand\\n pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no\\n name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by\\n eight.”\\nNow Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\\n about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\\n Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\\n number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\\n vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\\n near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\\n the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\\n returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\\n waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\\n without justifying it.\\nPresently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\\n down at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\\n no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but\\n he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\\n forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\\n healing.\\nThe stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re\\n planning to attempt the Brightside.”\\nBaron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read\\n telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going\\n to make a Brightside Crossing.”\\n“At perihelion?”\\n“Of course. When else?”\\nThe grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment\\n without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re\\n not going to make the Crossing.”\\n“Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.\\n“The name is Claney,” said the stranger.\\nThere was a silence. Then: “Claney?\\nPeter\\nClaney?”\\n“That’s right.”\\nBaron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger\\n gone. “Great balls of fire, man—\\nwhere have you been hiding?\\nWe’ve been trying to contact you for months!”\\n“I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the\\n whole idea.”\\n“Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My\\n friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking.\\n Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His\\n fingers were trembling.\\nPeter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you\\n want to hear.”\\n“But you’ve\\ngot\\nto. You’re the only man on Earth who’s\\n attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the\\n story you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need\\ndetails\\n. Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\\n miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a\\n finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma?\\n Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve\\n got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make\\n it across where your attempt failed—”\\n“You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.\\n“Of course we want to know. We\\nhave\\nto know.”\\n“It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t\\n do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross\\n the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”\\n“Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”\\nClaney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You\\n can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in\\n both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting.\\n It was the\\nplanet\\nthat whipped us, that and the\\nSun\\n. They’ll\\n whip you, too, if you try it.”\\n“Never,” said Baron.\\n“Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said.\\nI’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\\n I can remember \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mClaney said\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. I guess I was about ten when\\n Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082,\\n I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\\n I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\\nI know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\\n proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\\n conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made\\n a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a\\n terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the\\n Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\\n blood, sure as death.\\nBut it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\\n know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.\\n He was a major in the Interplanetary Service\\n for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\\n his commission.\\nHe was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\\n did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\\n the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\\n years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\\n since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\\n Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\\nI’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool,\\n the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\\n ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\\n place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\\n with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\\n of personality that could take a crew of wild men and\\n make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\\n miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\\nHe contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\\n first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\\n old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d\\n been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\\n and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\\n year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since\\n Venus and what my plans were.\\n“No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?”\\nHe looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”\\nI told him one-thirty-five.\\n“That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on\\n you, at any rate. How do you take heat?”\\n“You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”\\n“No, I mean\\nreal\\nheat.”\\nThen I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”\\n“That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be\\n dangerous, too.”\\n“What trip?”\\n“Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.\\nI whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”\\nHe threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion?\\n What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\\n heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\\n drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\\n days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\\n about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make\\n a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\\n a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then,\\nnobody’s\\ngot\\n Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”\\nI’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\\n it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\\n turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\\n the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\\n That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\\n place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\\n surface of the Sun itself.\\nIt would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\\n just\\nhow\\nhellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\\n was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\\n would cross it.\\nI wanted to be along.\\nThe Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\\n obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a\\n rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s\\n crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\\n the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\\n before.\\nTwilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside,\\n of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked\\n Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\\n hold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On\\n Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion\\n and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent\\n installation with a human crew could survive at either\\n extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between\\n Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\\n temperatures.\\nSanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\\n is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\\n 60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that\\n much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun\\n for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\\n to wheel around.\\nThe Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\\n about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\\n to make final preparations.\\nSanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said\\n so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\\n briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\\n arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\\n Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\\n had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\\n was like.\\nStone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but\\n he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\\n this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for\\n exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\\n him around like a puppy.\\nIt didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\\n in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re\\n liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\\n ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\\n borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\\n equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\\n and test.\\nWe dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and\\n some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our\\n equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\\n and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\\n We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\\n with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\\n and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\\nThe Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\\n said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”\\n“Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.\\n“He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name\\n for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve\\n probably heard of him.”\\nI’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t\\n too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil,\\n isn’t he?”\\n“Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\\n line? We’ll need plenty of both.”\\n“Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.\\n“No. Are you worried?”\\n“Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”\\nThe Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about\\n McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\\n trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to\\n do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.\\n “Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need\\n to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\\n we should leave in three days.”\\nTwo days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t\\n say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\\n spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\\n they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\\n far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\\n showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\\n that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\\n of our course.\\n“This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around\\n the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\\n these to the south and west\\ncould\\nbe active. Seismograph\\n tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\\n down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface\\n shifting.”\\nStone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant\\n surface activity.”\\nThe Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no\\n doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\\n Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\\n less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\\n find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”\\nIt seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\\n further we got from a solution. We knew there were active\\n volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though\\n surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\\n localized.\\nBut there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\\n well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\\n flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases\\n had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\\n millennia ago—but there was CO\\n 2\\n , and nitrogen, and traces of\\n other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\\n vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\\nThe atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\\n condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\\n to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\\n Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\\n that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\\n analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\\n we would find out what was happening where was to be there.\\nFinally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\\n rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and\\n I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\\n in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset\\n about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\\n he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.\\nHe was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\\n gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed,\\n sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\\n And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\\n something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\\nEvidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\\n arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\\n running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\\n Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\\n set for an early departure after we got some rest.\\n“And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling\\n the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”\\nPeter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”\\n“Of course.”\\nClaney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around\\n them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place\\n like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most\\n reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t\\n our big problem right then.\\nEquipment\\nworried us first and\\nroute\\nnext.”\\nBaron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you\\n have?”\\n“The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each\\n one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid\\n the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit\\n and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every\\n eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting\\n surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And\\n we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between\\n the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at\\n 770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders\\n if the suits failed somewhere.”\\n“How about the Bugs?”\\n“They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on\\n them too much for protection.”\\n“You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”\\n“We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility\\n and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of\\n forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant\\n that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air\\n between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like\\n water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of\\n sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”\\nBaron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass\\n as he set it down on the tablecloth.\\n“Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”\\n“Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right.\\n We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m\\n getting to that.”\\nHe settled back in his chair and continued.\\nWe jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\\n with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\\n could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\\n Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest\\n approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of\\n the planet at the hottest it ever gets.\\nThe Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\\n when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\\n that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\\n surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\\n was only half done—we would still have to travel another\\n two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\\n was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship,\\n approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\\nThat was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\\n seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\\n what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\\n time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\\n that.\\nThe Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\\n “Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\\n down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\\n you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of\\n dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty\\n closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\\n If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead\\n on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”\\nMcIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack\\n and I were planning to change around. We figured he could\\n take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”\\nThe Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that,\\n Jack?”\\nStone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”\\nMcIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It\\n doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does\\n it make any difference?”\\n“I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank\\n Peter along with me. Right?”\\n“Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going\\n to do the advance scouting?”\\n“It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead\\n Bug light as possible.”\\nMikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down\\n to the frame and wheels.”\\nMcIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the\\nadvance\\nwork.\\n You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to\\n pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?”\\n He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of\\n a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\\n ahead?”\\n“That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said\\n sharply.\\n“Charts! I’m talking about\\ndetail\\nwork. We don’t need to\\n worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you\\n can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts\\n down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\\n reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\\n I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\\n area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\\n Then—”\\n“No dice,” the Major broke in.\\n“But why not? We could save ourselves days!”\\n“I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When\\n we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\\n means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\\n climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\\n alone—any time, any place.”\\nMcIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\\n gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”\\n“Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff.\\n We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\\n Got that?”\\nMcIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\\n we nodded, too.\\n“All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight,\\n let’s go.”\\nIt was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll\\n never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\\n break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\\n first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\\n fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\\n the Twilight Lab.\\nI moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\\n Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\\n taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\\n Stone dragged the sledges.\\nEven at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\\n the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\\n ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\\n the first twenty miles.\\nI kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\\n the track the early research teams had made out into the edge\\n of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s\\n little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\\n were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\\n bite.\\nWe didn’t\\nfeel\\nthe heat so much those first days out. We\\nsaw\\nit. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\\n degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\\n that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\\n some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\\n sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\\nWe drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\\n came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\\n a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\\n The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\\n degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\\n forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates,\\n bulk gelatin, vitamins.\\nThe Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\\n we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\\n We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\\n and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting\\n reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\\n happened to be so.\\nWe didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\\n eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\\n but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking\\n at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\\n taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers\\n for one ice-cold bottle of beer.\\nAfter a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\\n the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\\n Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\\n Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\\n with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\\n with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\\n gases.\\nIt was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\\n the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\\n had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\\n tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\\n so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\\n the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\\n could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\\nYet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\\n before, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before\\n and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only\\n worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\\n itself.\\nBrightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\\n get us. That was the bargain.\\nI learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\\n The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\\n onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\\n east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\\n on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\\n cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\\n sides were shrouded with heavy ash.\\nWe couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\\n sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\\n face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\\n rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\\n rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\\n from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\\n dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\\n ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous\\n surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.\\nI learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\\n sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\\n from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\\n a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\\n light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\\n until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\\n was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\\n at first.\\nToo smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\\n think so, too.\\nMcIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\\n He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\\n driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\\n with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\\n now and then, never far, but a little further each time.\\nJack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\\n each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but\\n I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\\n enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\\nAnd every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\\n the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\\n filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\\n constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\\n end of an eight-hour trek.\\nBut it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the\\n penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\\n down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\\n route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\\n heard a sharp cry through our earphones.\\nI wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\\n spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\\n top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\\n the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\\n horrible pictures racing through our minds....\\nWe found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\\n and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck\\n of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\\n hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\\n the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\\n middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\\n two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\\n fiberglass helmets.\\nThis was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\\ntheir\\nBrightside Crossing.\\nOn the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.\\n It looked the same, but every now and then it\\nfelt\\ndifferent.\\n On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest\\n from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;\\n I gunned my motor and nothing happened.\\nI could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,\\n thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as\\n the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the\\n wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the\\n tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for\\n all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten\\n lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\\nI picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into\\n an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.\\n I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed\\n McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for\\n the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t\\n like it.\\nOne error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking\\n much about the others. I was worried about\\nme\\n, plenty\\n worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.\\n It wasn’t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the\\n thought out of my mind.\\nIt was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in\\n the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a\\n broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding\\n back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on\\n solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze\\n rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw\\n a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond\\n a deep crack.\\nI let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug\\n forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved\\n fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\\nThere was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;\\n a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across\\n a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could\\n feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the\\n ledge shift over a few feet.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

That\\'s the way it\\'s\\n been, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you\\n what it\\'s like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the\\n stars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing\\n fear—a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an\\n evil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\\n\\n\\n Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\\n\\n\\n It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,\\n were over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\\n laboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\\n spawning its first-born.\\n\\n\\n For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\\n of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\\n\\n\\n The\\nfirst\\ngraduating class, Laura. That\\'s why it was so important,\\n because we were the\\nfirst\\n.\\n\\n\\n We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach\\n of faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New\\n Mexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\\n grandparents and kid brothers and sisters—the people who a short time\\n ago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\\n wistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\\n never really existed.\\n\\n\\n But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\\n with pride in their eyes.\\n\\n\\n A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked\\n hard for six years, and now they\\'re going to do a lot of big things.\\n They\\'re going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\\n need. They\\'re going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land\\n that will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most\\n important of all, they\\'ll make other men think of the stars and look up\\n at them and feel humility—for mankind needs humility.\"\\n\\n\\n The speaker was Robert Chandler, who\\'d brought the first rocket down on\\n Mars just five years ago, who\\'d established the first colony there, and\\n who had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\\n\\n\\n Instead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders\\n and his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth\\n and skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,\\n for I was thinking:\\nHe\\'s already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the\\n others alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the\\n first!\\nMickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don\\'t\\n see \\'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\\n\\n\\n I blinked. \"Who?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My folks.\"\\n\\n\\n That was something I didn\\'t have to worry about. My parents had died in\\n a strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn\\'t needed many of those\\n \"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I\\'d sent to Charlie\\n Taggart.\\n\\n\\n Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\\n veteran of Everson\\'s first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\\n ago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\\nLunar\\n Lady\\n, a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\\n Sands.\\n\\n\\n I remembered how, as a kid, I\\'d pestered him in the Long Island\\n Spaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he\\'d grown to like\\n me until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\\n remembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\\n\\n\\n My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn\\'t find Charlie\\'s. It\\n wasn\\'t surprising. The\\nLunar Lady\\nwas in White Sands now, but\\n liberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter\\n, I told myself.\\n\\n\\n Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see \\'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\\n\\n\\n Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\\n garden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\\n tenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\\n he was beside me; we\\'d been a good team during those final months at\\n the Academy and I knew we\\'d be a good team in space. The Universe was\\n mighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\\n half as big.\\n\\n\\n And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\\n were gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\\n the stars in my mind\\'s vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\\n like a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\\n the sons of Earth.\\nThey expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\\n civilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\\n a hell of a lot more. They think there\\'s nothing we can\\'t do.\\nI felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\\nAt last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\\n babbling wave.\\n\\n\\n Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\\n\\n\\n His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\\n like a child\\'s. He\\'d been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\\n rows.\\n\\n\\n But he wasn\\'t the Charlie I\\'d seen a year ago. He\\'d become gaunt and\\n old, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\\n it was hard to believe he\\'d once been young.\\n\\n\\n He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\\n\\n\\n \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we\\'ll celebrate\\n tonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we\\'ll celebrate as\\n good spacemen should!\"\\n\\n\\n Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\\n walking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\\n with some silent melody.\\n\\n\\n And you, Laura, were with him.\\n\\n\\n \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\\n\\n\\n I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\\n of your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\\n golden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\\n of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\\n gentleness that I\\'d never seen in eyes before.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I\\'ve heard of no one else for\\n the past year.\"\\n\\n\\n A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\\n introduction of Charlie.\\n\\n\\n You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\\n Stardust was not a cadet\\'s notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\\n scorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\\n shiny black suit that was a relic of Everson\\'s early-day Moon Patrol.\\n His tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\\n\\n\\n And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\\n result of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\\n accustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\\n knew, would find them ugly.\\n\\n\\n You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It\\'s a privilege to\\n meet you, Charlie. Just think—one of Everson\\'s men, one of the first\\n to reach the Moon!\"\\n\\n\\n Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the\\n weekend with us, aren\\'t you, Ben?\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We\\'re\\n planning to see the town tonight.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their\\n own plane, so it would be no problem. And we\\'ve got a big guest room.\\n Charlie, wouldn\\'t you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\\n Moon?\"\\n\\n\\n Charlie\\'s answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\\n that he\\'d infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\\n fizzes and Plutonian zombies.\\n\\n\\n But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie\\'s kind of celebration.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'d really like to come,\" I said.\\nOn our way to the \\'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was\\n a tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor\\n should look.\\n\\n\\n \"Ben,\" he called, \"don\\'t forget that offer. Remember you\\'ve got two\\n months to decide.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I answered. \"Better not count on me.\"\\n\\n\\n A moment later Mickey said, frowning, \"What was he talking about, Ben?\\n Did he make you an offer?\"\\n\\n\\n I laughed. \"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching\\n astrogation. What a life\\nthat\\nwould be! Imagine standing in a\\n classroom for forty years when I\\'ve got the chance to—\"\\n\\n\\n I hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \"When you\\'ve got the\\n chance to be the first to reach a new planet. That\\'s what most of you\\n want, isn\\'t it? That\\'s what Mickey used to want.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to\\n understand the hunger that could lie in a man\\'s heart.\\n\\n\\n Then your last words came back and jabbed me: \"That\\'s what Mickey used\\n to want.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nUsed\\nto want?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n You bit your lip, not answering.\\n\\n\\n \"What did she mean, Mickey?\"\\n\\n\\n Mickey looked down at his feet. \"I didn\\'t want to tell you yet, Ben.\\n We\\'ve been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty\\n uniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If\\n you\\'re lucky, you\\'re good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or\\n another gets you. They don\\'t insure rocketmen, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \"What are you trying to\\n say, Mickey?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor\\n of White Sands Port.\" He raised his hand to stop me. \"I know. It\\'s not\\n so exciting. I\\'ll just live a lot longer. I\\'m sorry, Ben.\"\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my\\n knees with the blast of a jet.\\n\\n\\n \"It doesn\\'t change anything, Ben—right now, I mean. We can still have\\n a good weekend.\"\\n\\n\\n Charlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to\\n reach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the\\n \\'copter.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said to Mickey, \"we can still have a good weekend.\"\\nI liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\\n They were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\\n deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was\\n cool on this warm summer night, with a \\'copter and a tri-dimensional\\n video, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or\\n housework.\\n\\n\\n Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a\\n shower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\\n\\n\\n At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit\\n Mars once, but I\\'ll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.\\n Skipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin\\' cough,\\n the medic says, not knowin\\' the air had chemicals that turned to acid\\n in your lungs. I\\'d never been to Mars before, but I knew better\\'n that.\\n Hell, I says, that ain\\'t whoopin\\' cough, that\\'s lung-rot.\"\\n\\n\\n That was when your father said he wasn\\'t so hungry after all.\\n\\n\\n Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,\\n to watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally\\n streaked up from White Sands.\\n\\n\\n We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\\n \"Charlie is funny, isn\\'t he? He\\'s nice and I\\'m glad he\\'s here, but he\\'s\\n sort of funny.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s an old-time spaceman. You didn\\'t need much education in those\\n days, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a\\n spaceman then.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But he wasn\\'t always a spaceman. Didn\\'t he ever have a family?\"\\n\\n\\n I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie\\n doesn\\'t like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as\\n I know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\\n\\n\\n You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew\\n suddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\\n\\n\\n There was silence.\\n\\n\\n You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\\n flecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\\n feeling that I shouldn\\'t have come here.\\n\\n\\n You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,\\n Laura?\"\\n\\n\\n You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn\\'t be\\n thinking it. You\\'d hate me if I told you, and I wouldn\\'t want that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I could never hate you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It—it\\'s about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you\\n want to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were\\n kids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I\\n dreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I\\n lived for months, just thinking about it.\\n\\n\\n \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,\\n and the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I\\n realized England wasn\\'t so different from America. Places seem exciting\\n before you get to them, and afterward they\\'re not really.\"\\n\\n\\n I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think\\n maybe I haven\\'t grown up yet?\"\\n\\n\\n Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it\\'d be good to be a spaceman,\\n to see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it\\n worth the things you\\'d have to give up?\"\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up\\nwhat\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\\n\\n\\n All through the years I\\'d been walking down a single, narrow path.\\n\\n\\n Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on\\n the stars.\\n\\n\\n Now I\\'d stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that\\n I\\'d never noticed before.\\nYou can go into space\\n, I thought,\\nand try to do as much living in\\n ten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died\\n in a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie\\n buried in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you\\'re lucky, like\\n Charlie—a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally\\n alone, never finding a home.\\nOr there\\'s the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth\\n in cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with\\n a wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow\\n old, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who\\n fill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous\\n dust.\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" you said. \"I didn\\'t mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense—a lot of\\n sense.\"\\nThe next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his\\n scarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,\\n tight coughs.\\n\\n\\n Then he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \"I\\'m\\n leavin\\' that for you. It\\'s full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought\\n maybe you\\'d like to have \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n I scowled, not understanding. \"Why, Charlie? What for?\"\\n\\n\\n He shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \"Oh,\\n it\\'s just that I\\'ve been dodgin\\' meteors now for twenty-five years.\\n That\\'s a long time, boy. Ain\\'t one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.\\n Some of these days, I won\\'t be so lucky.\"\\n\\n\\n I tried to laugh. \"You\\'re good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\"\\n\\n\\n He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \"Maybe. Anyway, I\\'m\\n gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell\\n you what. There\\'s a little stone cafe on Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just\\n off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a\\n look inside. I\\'ll probably be there.\"\\n\\n\\n He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\\n\\n\\n \"Not used to this Earth air,\" he muttered. \"What I need\\'s some Martian\\n climate.\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly that cough frightened me. It didn\\'t seem normal. I wondered,\\n too, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were\\n drugged.\\n\\n\\n I shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn\\'t talk about\\n going to Mars. The medics wouldn\\'t let him go even as far as Luna.\\n\\n\\n We watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\\n\\n\\n \"When will you be back?\" you asked.\\n\\n\\n Charlie\\'s hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \"Maybe a\\n couple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\"\\n\\n\\n Then he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\\n\\n\\n I wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill\\n the doubt worming through my brain.\\n\\n\\n But he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was\\n gone.\\nThat afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy\\'s\\n room than a spaceman\\'s. In it were all the little things that kids\\n treasure—pennants, models of Everson\\'s two ships, a tennis trophy,\\n books, a home-made video.\\n\\n\\n I began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.\\n I could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched\\n their children grow to adulthood.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of\\n them drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it\\n had been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and\\n routines and rules. I\\'d been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,\\n I hadn\\'t realized I was different.\\nMy folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren\\'t for rockets, I\\'d\\n have lived the kind of life a kid should live.\\nMickey noticed my frown.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I\\'m just\\n not like you and Charlie, I guess. I—\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I understand, Mickey. I\\'m not sore, really.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Listen, then. You haven\\'t accepted any offer yet, have you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the\\nOdyssey\\n, the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,\\n too, for the Moon Patrol, but that\\'s old stuff, not much better than\\n teaching. I want to be in deep space.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy\\n Earth life while you can. Okay?\"\\n\\n\\n I felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted\\n someone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of\\n courage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\\n\\n\\n But I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the\\n flecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever\\n so slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as\\n much as I loved the stars.\\n\\n\\n And I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \"Sure,\\n I\\'ll stay, Mickey. Sure.\"\\nForty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the\\n little things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying\\n down to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to\\n teach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon\\n and the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and\\n promise of a child\\'s dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\\n\\n\\n One morning I thought,\\nWhy must I make a choice? Why can\\'t I have both\\n you and the stars? Would that be asking too much?\\nAll day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\\n\\n\\n That evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \"Laura, I\\n want you to be my wife.\"\\n\\n\\n You looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face\\n flushed.\\n\\n\\n Then you murmured, \"I—I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me\\n to marry a spaceman or a teacher?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t a spaceman marry, too?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don\\'t you see,\\n Ben? You\\'d be like Charlie. Gone for\\nmaybe\\ntwo months,\\nmaybe\\ntwo\\n years. Then you\\'d have a twenty-four hour liberty—and I\\'d have what?\"\\n\\n\\n Somehow I\\'d expected words like these, but still they hurt. \"I wouldn\\'t\\n have to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,\\n then teach.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn\\'t\\n you want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\\n\\n\\n Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears\\n glittering in your eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you think I\\'d dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened\\n on the\\nCyclops\\n. There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was\\n flooded with radiation—just for a second. It didn\\'t seem serious. The\\n men had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it\\n was—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, Laura. Don\\'t say it.\"\\n\\n\\n You had to finish. \"It was a monster.\"\\n\\n\\n That night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me\\n sleep.\\nYou\\'ve got to decide now\\n, I told myself.\\nYou can\\'t stay here. You\\'ve\\n got to make a choice.\\nThe teaching job was still open. The spot on the\\nOdyssey\\nwas still\\n open—and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the\\n way to Pluto.\\nYou can take Dean Dawson\\'s job and stay with Laura and have kids and a\\n home and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now.\\nOr you can see what\\'s on the other side of the mountain. You can be a\\n line in a history book.\\nI cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He\\'d say, \"Get the hell out\\n of there, boy. Don\\'t let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get\\n out there on the\\nOdyssey\\nwhere you belong. We got a date on Mars,\\n remember? At the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand\\n Canal.\"\\n\\n\\n That\\'s what he\\'d say.\\n\\n\\n And yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh God,\" I moaned, \"what shall I do?\"\\nNext morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and\\n brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who\\n could be sending me a message.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,\\n automatic voice droned: \"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to\\n inform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\"\\n\\n\\n Then there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word\\n \"lung-rot\" and the metallic phrase, \"This message brought to you by\\n courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\"\\n\\n\\n I stood staring at the cylinder.\\n\\n\\n Charles Taggart was dead.\\n\\n\\n Charles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\\n\\n\\n My heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn\\'t be! Not Charlie!\\n The audiogram had lied!\\n\\n\\n I pressed the stud again. \"... regret to inform you of death of\\n Charles ...\"\\n\\n\\n I hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken\\n voice droned on.\\n\\n\\n You ran to it, shut it off. \"I\\'m sorry, Ben, so terribly—\"\\n\\n\\n Without answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I\\n remembered Charlie\\'s coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.\\n The metallic words had told the truth.\\n\\n\\n I sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at\\n Charlie\\'s faded tin box.\\n\\n\\n Then, finally, I fingered his meager possessions—a few wrinkled\\n photos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,\\n a gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.\\nThis was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.\\n It was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters\\n instead of children, a medal instead of a home.\\nIt\\'d be a great future\\n, I thought.\\nYou\\'d dream of sitting in a dingy\\n stone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,\\n stinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls\\n with dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first\\n sign of lung-rot.\\nTo hell with it!\\n\\n\\n I walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\\n\\n\\n I accepted that job teaching.\\nAnd now, Laura, it\\'s nearly midnight. You\\'re in your room, sleeping,\\n and the house is silent.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\\n writing this.\\n\\n\\n I looked through Charlie\\'s box again, more carefully this time, reading\\n the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\\n Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\\n could tell me what he could not express in words.\\n\\n\\n And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\\n\\n\\n A wedding ring.\\n\\n\\n In that past he never talked about, there was a woman—his wife.\\n Charlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\\n decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\\n travel both. He later learned what we already know—that there can be\\n no compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\\n\\n\\n Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\\n could look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\\n live to see. Charlie didn\\'t leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\\n left himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy\\'s dream can also be a\\n man\\'s dream.\\n\\n\\n He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\\n knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\\n kind—but that doesn\\'t matter now.\\n\\n\\n Do you know\\nwhy\\nhe wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn\\'t\\n want to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\\n\\n\\n It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\\n Universe, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\\n brothers, the planets his children.\\n\\n\\n You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\\n after you reach it. But how can one ever be\\nsure\\nuntil the journey is\\n made? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\\n star and think,\\nI might have gone there; I could have been the first\\n?\\n\\n\\n We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\\n be lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\\n\\n\\n Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\\n to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\\n last night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\\n to you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\\n\\n\\n Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\\n the best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\\n\\n\\n Right now I\\'ve got a date that I\\'m going to keep—at a dingy stone cafe\\n on Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\\n\\n\\n Stardust Charlie will be there; he\\'ll go with me in memory to whatever\\n part of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\\n\\n\\n I have two wedding rings with me—his wife\\'s ring and yours.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence\\n that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\\nBREAKAWAY\\nBY STANLEY GIMBLE\\nIllustrated by Freas\\nShe surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting\\n what she wanted.\\nPhil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his\\n long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious\\n and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines\\n around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his\\n wife.\\n\\n\\n \"All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?\"\\n\\n\\n His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not\\n theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too\\n far. She said, \"You look fine, Phil. You look just right.\" She managed a\\n smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash\\n tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.\\n\\n\\n He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her\\n face until she was looking into his eyes. \"You\\'re the most beautiful\\n girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I think so. Yes, I\\'m sure you did,\" she said, finishing the\\n ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat\\n beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped\\n smiling.\\n\\n\\n \"Honey, look at me,\" he said. \"It isn\\'t going to be bad. Honestly it\\n isn\\'t. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they\\n wouldn\\'t be sending me; you know that. I told you that we\\'ve sent five\\n un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.\"\\n\\n\\n She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her\\n wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Phil, don\\'t go. Please don\\'t. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn\\'t have a\\n wife. Can\\'t he go? They\\'d understand, Phil. Please!\" She was holding his\\n arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.\\n\\n\\n \"Mary, you know I can\\'t back out now. How could I? It\\'s been three\\n years. You know how much I\\'ve wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing\\n would ever be right with me again if I didn\\'t go. Please don\\'t make it\\n hard.\" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of\\n her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He\\n released her and stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I\\'ll come to say good-by.\" She paused and dropped her eyes. \"Phil,\\n if you go, I won\\'t be here when you get back—if you get back. I won\\'t\\n be here because I won\\'t be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my\\n life. It isn\\'t the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I\\n love you, I just couldn\\'t take that, Phil. I\\'m sorry. I guess I\\'m not\\n the noble sort of wife.\"\\n\\n\\n She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee\\n table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the\\n lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching\\n her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,\" Phil said. His\\n voice was dry and low. \"I didn\\'t know you felt this way about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the\\n wife of a space pilot. But I don\\'t think I ever really believed it was\\n possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.\\n It\\'s so stupid to jeopardize everything we\\'ve got for a ridiculous\\n dream!\"\\n\\n\\n He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.\\n \"Mary, listen to me,\" he said. \"It isn\\'t a dream. It\\'s real. There\\'s\\n nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no\\n man ever had the chance to do what I\\'m going to do tonight—no man ever.\\n If I backed out now for any reason, I\\'d never be able to look at the sky\\n again. I\\'d be through.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in\\n her eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go, if you\\'re still going,\" she finally said.\\nThey drove through the streets of the small town with its small\\n bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was\\n a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It\\n existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off\\n zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the\\n ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed\\n ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,\\n if such was its destiny.\\n\\n\\n Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led\\n across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they\\n could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the\\n take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching\\n out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the\\n guard. He read Phil\\'s pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and\\n then saluted. \"Good luck, colonel,\" he said, and shook Phil\\'s hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks, sergeant. I\\'ll be seeing you next week,\" Phil said, and smiled.\\n They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,\\n and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He\\n turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a\\n cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the\\n windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished\\n surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until\\n the eye lost the tip against the stars.\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s beautiful, Mary. You\\'ve never seen her before, have you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I\\'ve never seen her before,\" she said. \"Hadn\\'t you better go?\" Her\\n voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.\\n \"Please go now, Phil,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,\\n her head buried against his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Good-by, darling,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Wish me luck, Mary?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, good luck, Phil,\" she said. He opened the car door and got out.\\n The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell\\n of the rocket waiting silently for flight.\\n\\n\\n \"Mary, I—\" he began, and then turned and strode toward the\\n administration building without looking back.\\nInside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The\\n tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that\\n Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle\\n stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to\\n him and took his hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren\\'t coming. You all\\n set, son?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir, I\\'m all set, I guess,\" Phil said.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He\\'s over here by\\n the radar.\"\\n\\n\\n As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his\\n hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy\\n waved to him, but he didn\\'t smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say\\n something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy\\'s turn would come\\n later.\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Secretary,\" the general said, \"this is Colonel Conover. He\\'ll be\\n the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the\\n Secretary of Defense.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How do you do, sir. I\\'m very proud to meet you,\" Phil said.\\n\\n\\n \"On the contrary, colonel. I\\'m very proud to meet you. I\\'ve been looking\\n at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man\\n again. I\\'d like to be going. It\\'s a thrilling thought—man\\'s first\\n adventure into the universe. You\\'re lighting a new dawn of history,\\n colonel. It\\'s a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had\\n it didn\\'t realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you, sir. I\\'m aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.\"\\n\\n\\n The general took Phil\\'s arm and they walked to the briefing room. There\\n were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly\\n connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in\\n front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the\\n last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had\\n gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.\\n He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.\\n\\n\\n The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.\\n\\n\\n \"... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway\\n to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours\\n until—\"\\n\\n\\n Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then\\n the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same\\n unanswered questions on each man\\'s face. There were forced smiles and\\n handshakes. They were ready now.\\n\\n\\n \"Phil,\" the general said, and took him aside.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Phil, you\\'re ... you feel all right, don\\'t you, son?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Phil, I\\'ve spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you\\n better than I know myself in many ways. And I\\'ve studied the\\n psychologist\\'s reports on you carefully. Maybe it\\'s just nervousness,\\n Phil, but I think there\\'s something wrong. Is there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, sir. There\\'s nothing wrong,\" Phil said, but his voice didn\\'t carry\\n conviction. He reached for a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \"Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might\\n mean. You\\'ve got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your\\n life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our\\n success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension\\n wrong with you. Want to tell me?\"\\nOutside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of\\n the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;\\n and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they\\n had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt\\n that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond\\n the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.\\n Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of\\n wire. But her eyes were on the ship.\\n\\n\\n And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the\\n administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed\\n into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,\\n alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the\\n rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the\\n ground and then disappeared through a small port.\\n\\n\\n Mary waved to him. \"Good-by,\" she said to herself, but the words stuck\\n tight in her throat.\\n\\n\\n The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the\\n fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,\\n from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar\\n that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned\\n rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.\\nFor a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the\\n heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to\\n herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.\\n\\n\\n \"Phil! Oh, Phil.\" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and\\n over.\\n\\n\\n \"They wouldn\\'t let me go, Mary,\" he said finally. \"The general would not\\n let me go.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his\\n cheeks. \"Thank, God,\" she said. \"It doesn\\'t matter, darling. The only\\n thing that matters is you didn\\'t go.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right, Mary,\" he said. His voice was low—so low she could\\n hardly hear him. \"It doesn\\'t matter. Nothing matters now.\" He stood with\\n his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked\\n toward the car.\\nTHE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

She said\\n mildly, \"You\\'re late.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t yell at me, I\\n feel awful,\" Simon told\\n her. He sat down at his desk, passed\\n his tongue over his teeth in distaste,\\n groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the\\n aspirin bottle.\\n\\n\\n He looked over at Betty and said,\\n almost as though reciting, \"What I\\n need is a vacation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going\\n to use for money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Providence,\" Simon told her\\n whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,\\n \"will provide.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing\\n vacations it\\'d be nice if Providence\\n turned up a missing jewel deal, say.\\n Something where you could deduce\\n that actually the ruby ring had gone\\n down the drain and was caught in the\\n elbow. Something that would net\\n about fifty dollars.\"\\n\\n\\n Simon said, mournful of tone,\\n \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five\\n hundred?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All\\n I want is enough to pay me this\\n week\\'s salary.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you\\n took this job you said it was the romance\\n that appealed to you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hm-m-m. I didn\\'t know most\\n sleuthing amounted to snooping\\n around department stores to check on\\n the clerks knocking down.\"\\n\\n\\n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now\\n it comes.\"\\nThere was a knock.\\n\\n\\n Betty bounced up with Olympic\\n agility and had the door swinging\\n wide before the knocking was quite\\n completed.\\n\\n\\n He was old, little and had bug\\n eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His\\n suit was cut in the style of yesteryear\\n but when a suit costs two or\\n three hundred dollars you still retain\\n caste whatever the styling.\\n\\n\\n Simon said unenthusiastically,\\n \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\\n the client\\'s chair. \"Sit down,\\n sir.\"\\n\\n\\n The client fussed himself with\\n Betty\\'s assistance into the seat, bug-eyed\\n Simon, said finally, \"You know\\n my name, that\\'s pretty good. Never\\n saw you before in my life. Stop fussing\\n with me, young lady. Your ad\\n in the phone book says you\\'ll investigate\\n anything.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\\n one exception.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\\n travel?\"\\n\\n\\n Simon said nothing. Across the\\n room, where she had resumed her\\n seat, Betty cleared her throat. When\\n Simon continued to say nothing she\\n ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, why?\"\\n\\n\\n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\\n None was forthcoming. There\\n ought to be some very quick, positive,\\n definite answer. She said, \"Well,\\n for one thing, paradox. Suppose you\\n had a time machine and traveled back\\n a hundred years or so and killed your\\n own great-grandfather. Then how\\n could you ever be born?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\\n fellow growled. \"How?\"\\n\\n\\n Simon said, \"Let\\'s get to the point,\\n what you wanted to see me about.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\\n some time travelers,\" the old boy\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Betty was too far in now to maintain\\n her proper role of silent secretary.\\n \"Time travelers,\" she said, not\\n very intelligently.\\n\\n\\n The potential client sat more erect,\\n obviously with intent to hold the\\n floor for a time. He removed the\\n pince-nez glasses and pointed them\\n at Betty. He said, \"Have you read\\n much science fiction, Miss?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\\n\\n\\n \"Then you\\'ll realize that there are\\n a dozen explanations of the paradoxes\\n of time travel. Every writer in\\n the field worth his salt has explained\\n them away. But to get on. It\\'s my\\n contention that within a century or\\n so man will have solved the problems\\n of immortality and eternal youth, and\\n it\\'s also my suspicion that he will\\n eventually be able to travel in time.\\n So convinced am I of these possibilities\\n that I am willing to gamble a\\n portion of my fortune to investigate\\n the presence in our era of such time\\n travelers.\"\\n\\n\\n Simon seemed incapable of carrying\\n the ball this morning, so Betty\\n said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the\\n future has developed time travel why\\n don\\'t we ever meet such travelers?\"\\n\\n\\n Simon put in a word. \"The usual\\n explanation, Betty, is that they can\\'t\\n afford to allow the space-time continuum\\n track to be altered. If, say, a\\n time traveler returned to a period of\\n twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\\n then all subsequent history would be\\n changed. In that case, the time traveler\\n himself might never be born. They\\n have to tread mighty carefully.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn\\'t\\n expect you to be so well informed\\n on the subject, young man.\"\\n\\n\\n Simon shrugged and fumbled\\n again with the aspirin bottle.\\nMr. Oyster went on. \"I\\'ve been\\n considering the matter for some time\\n and—\"\\n\\n\\n Simon held up a hand. \"There\\'s\\n no use prolonging this. As I understand\\n it, you\\'re an elderly gentleman\\n with a considerable fortune and you\\n realize that thus far nobody has succeeded\\n in taking it with him.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to\\n their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then\\n nodded.\\n\\n\\n Simon said, \"You want to hire me\\n to find a time traveler and in some\\n manner or other—any manner will\\n do—exhort from him the secret of\\n eternal life and youth, which you figure\\n the future will have discovered.\\n You\\'re willing to pony up a part of\\n this fortune of yours, if I can deliver\\n a bona fide time traveler.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right!\"\\n\\n\\n Betty had been looking from one\\n to the other. Now she said, plaintively,\\n \"But where are you going to find\\n one of these characters—especially if\\n they\\'re interested in keeping hid?\"\\n\\n\\n The old boy was the center again.\\n \"I told you I\\'d been considering it\\n for some time. The\\nOktoberfest\\n,\\n that\\'s where they\\'d be!\" He seemed\\n elated.\\n\\n\\n Betty and Simon waited.\\n\\n\\n \"The\\nOktoberfest\\n,\" he repeated.\\n \"The greatest festival the world has\\n ever seen, the carnival,\\nferia\\n,\\nfiesta\\nto beat them all. Every year it\\'s held\\n in Munich. Makes the New Orleans\\n Mardi gras look like a quilting\\n party.\" He began to swing into the\\n spirit of his description. \"It originally\\n started in celebration of the wedding\\n of some local prince a century\\n and a half ago and the Bavarians had\\n such a bang-up time they\\'ve been\\n holding it every year since. The\\n Munich breweries do up a special\\n beer,\\nMarzenbräu\\nthey call it, and\\n each brewery opens a tremendous tent\\n on the fair grounds which will hold\\n five thousand customers apiece. Millions\\n of liters of beer are put away,\\n hundreds of thousands of barbecued\\n chickens, a small herd of oxen are\\n roasted whole over spits, millions of\\n pair of\\nweisswurst\\n, a very special\\n sausage, millions upon millions of\\n pretzels—\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We\\'ll accept\\n it. The\\nOktoberfest\\nis one whale\\n of a wingding.\"\\n\"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into\\n his subject now, \"that\\'s where they\\'d\\n be, places like the\\nOktoberfest\\n. For\\n one thing, a time traveler wouldn\\'t\\n be conspicuous. At a festival like this\\n somebody with a strange accent, or\\n who didn\\'t know exactly how to wear\\n his clothes correctly, or was off the\\n ordinary in any of a dozen other\\n ways, wouldn\\'t be noticed. You could\\n be a four-armed space traveler from\\n Mars, and you still wouldn\\'t be conspicuous\\n at the\\nOktoberfest\\n. People\\n would figure they had D.T.\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But why would a time traveler\\n want to go to a—\" Betty began.\\n\\n\\n \"Why not! What better opportunity\\n to study a people than when they\\n are in their cups? If\\nyou\\ncould go\\n back a few thousand years, the things\\n you would wish to see would be a\\n Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites\\n of Dionysus, or one of Alexander\\'s\\n orgies. You wouldn\\'t want to wander\\n up and down the streets of, say,\\n Athens while nothing was going on,\\n particularly when you might be revealed\\n as a suspicious character not\\n being able to speak the language, not\\n knowing how to wear the clothes and\\n not familiar with the city\\'s layout.\"\\n He took a deep breath. \"No ma\\'am,\\n you\\'d have to stick to some great\\n event, both for the sake of actual\\n interest and for protection against being\\n unmasked.\"\\n\\n\\n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,\\n that\\'s the story. What are your rates?\\n The\\nOktoberfest\\nstarts on Friday and\\n continues for sixteen days. You can\\n take the plane to Munich, spend a\\n week there and—\"\\n\\n\\n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not\\n interested.\"\\n\\n\\n As soon as Betty had got her jaw\\n back into place, she glared unbelievingly\\n at him.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\\n \"See here, young man, I realize\\n this isn\\'t an ordinary assignment,\\n however, as I said, I am willing to\\n risk a considerable portion of my\\n fortune—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can\\'t be\\n done.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"\\n Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\\n like the fact that you already seem\\n to have some interest and knowledge\\n of the matter. I liked the way you\\n knew my name when I walked in the\\n door; my picture doesn\\'t appear often\\n in the papers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\\n in his voice.\\n\\n\\n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\\n you bring me a time traveler.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Out of the question,\" Simon\\n said.\\n\\n\\n \"But\\nwhy\\n?\" Betty wailed.\\n\\n\\n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\\n two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\\n you a funny story. It goes like\\n this:\"\\nI got a thousand dollars from Mr.\\n Oyster \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mSimon began\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m in the way\\n of an advance, and leaving him with\\n Betty who was making out a receipt,\\n I hustled back to the apartment and\\n packed a bag. Hell, I\\'d wanted a vacation\\n anyway, this was a natural. On\\n the way to Idlewild I stopped off at\\n the Germany Information Offices for\\n some tourist literature.\\n\\n\\n It takes roughly three and a half\\n hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\\n I spent the time planning the\\n fun I was going to have.\\n\\n\\n It takes roughly seven and a half\\n hours from Gander to Shannon and\\n I spent that time dreaming up material\\n I could put into my reports to\\n Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to\\n give him some kind of report for his\\n money. Time travel yet! What a\\n laugh!\\n\\n\\n Between Shannon and Munich a\\n faint suspicion began to simmer in\\n my mind. These statistics I read on\\n the\\nOktoberfest\\nin the Munich tourist\\n pamphlets. Five million people\\n attended annually.\\n\\n\\n Where did five million people\\n come from to attend an overgrown\\n festival in comparatively remote\\n Southern Germany? The tourist season\\n is over before September 21st,\\n first day of the gigantic beer bust.\\n Nor could the Germans account for\\n any such number. Munich itself has\\n a population of less than a million,\\n counting children.\\n\\n\\n And those millions of gallons of\\n beer, the hundreds of thousands of\\n chickens, the herds of oxen. Who\\n ponied up all the money for such expenditures?\\n How could the average\\n German, with his twenty-five dollars\\n a week salary?\\n\\n\\n In Munich there was no hotel\\n space available. I went to the Bahnhof\\n where they have a hotel service\\n and applied. They put my name\\n down, pocketed the husky bribe,\\n showed me where I could check my\\n bag, told me they\\'d do what they\\n could, and to report back in a few\\n hours.\\n\\n\\n I had another suspicious twinge.\\n If five million people attended this\\n beer bout, how were they accommodated?\\n\\n\\n The\\nTheresienwiese\\n, the fair\\n ground, was only a few blocks\\n away. I was stiff from the plane ride\\n so I walked.\\nThere are seven major brewers in\\n the Munich area, each of them represented\\n by one of the circuslike tents\\n that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent\\n contained benches and tables for\\n about five thousand persons and from\\n six to ten thousands pack themselves\\n in, competing for room. In the center\\n is a tremendous bandstand, the\\n musicians all\\nlederhosen\\nclad, the\\n music as Bavarian as any to be found\\n in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of\\n peasant garbed\\nfräuleins\\ndarted about\\n the tables with quart sized earthenware\\n mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,\\n kraut and pretzels.\\n\\n\\n I found a place finally at a table\\n which had space for twenty-odd beer\\n bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an\\n assortment of Germans and foreign\\n tourists as could have been dreamed\\n up, ranging from a seventy- or\\n eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian\\n costume, to the bald-headed drunk\\n across the table from me.\\n\\n\\n A desperate waitress bearing six\\n mugs of beer in each hand scurried\\n past. They call them\\nmasses\\n, by the\\n way, not mugs. The bald-headed\\n character and I both held up a finger\\n and she slid two of the\\nmasses\\nover\\n to us and then hustled on.\\n\\n\\n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,\\n holding up his\\nmass\\nin toast.\\n\\n\\n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before\\n sipping, I said, \"You know, the\\n tourist pamphlets say this stuff is\\n eighteen per cent. That\\'s nonsense.\\n No beer is that strong.\" I took a long\\n pull.\\n\\n\\n He looked at me, waiting.\\n\\n\\n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\\n\\n\\n A\\nmass\\nor two apiece later he looked\\n carefully at the name engraved on\\n his earthenware mug. \"Löwenbräu,\"\\n he said. He took a small notebook\\n from his pocket and a pencil, noted\\n down the word and returned the\\n things.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s a queer looking pencil you\\n have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.\\n Shouldn\\'t have said that.\"\\n\\n\\n I had never heard of the brand so\\n I skipped it.\\n\\n\\n \"Next is the Hofbräu,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Next what?\" Baldy\\'s conversation\\n didn\\'t seem to hang together very\\n well.\\n\\n\\n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All\\n my life I\\'ve been wanting to go back\\n to an\\nOktoberfest\\nand sample every\\n one of the seven brands of the best\\n beer the world has ever known. I\\'m\\n only as far as Löwenbräu. I\\'m afraid\\n I\\'ll never make it.\"\\n\\n\\n I finished my\\nmass\\n. \"I\\'ll help\\n you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.\\n Name is Simon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you\\n help?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m still fresh—comparatively.\\n I\\'ll navigate you around. There are\\n seven beer tents. How many have you\\n got through, so far?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth\\n said.\\n\\n\\n I looked at him. \"It\\'s going to be\\n a chore,\" I said. \"You\\'ve already got\\n a nice edge on.\"\\n\\n\\n Outside, as we made our way to\\n the next tent, the fair looked like\\n every big State-Fair ever seen, except\\n it was bigger. Games, souvenir\\n stands, sausage stands, rides, side\\n shows, and people, people, people.\\n\\n\\n The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing\\n as the last but we managed to\\n find two seats.\\n\\n\\n The band was blaring, and five\\n thousand half-swacked voices were\\n roaring accompaniment.\\nIn Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\\nEins, Zwei, G\\'sufa!\\nAt the\\nG\\'sufa\\neverybody upped\\n with the mugs and drank each other\\'s\\n health.\\n\\n\\n \"This is what I call a real beer\\n bust,\" I said approvingly.\\n\\n\\n Arth was waving to a waitress. As\\n in the Löwenbräu tent, a full quart\\n was the smallest amount obtainable.\\n\\n\\n A beer later I said, \"I don\\'t know\\n if you\\'ll make it or not, Arth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Make what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"All seven tents.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n\\n A waitress was on her way by,\\n mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured\\n to her for refills.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I\\n asked him, in the way of making\\n conversation.\\n\\n\\n \"2183.\"\\n\\n\\n \"2183 where?\"\\n\\n\\n He looked at me, closing one eye\\n to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,\\n 2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\\n\\n\\n \"New Albuquerque? Where\\'s\\n that?\"\\n\\n\\n Arth thought about it. Took another\\n long pull at the beer. \"Right\\n across the way from old Albuquerque,\"\\n he said finally. \"Maybe we\\n ought to be getting on to the\\n Pschorrbräu tent.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe we ought to eat something\\n first,\" I said. \"I\\'m beginning to feel\\n this. We could get some of that barbecued\\n ox.\"\\n\\n\\n Arth closed his eyes in pain.\\n \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn\\'t possibly\\n eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"\\n I said.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s supposed to be considerable\\n nourishment in beer.\"\\n\\n\\n That made sense. I yelled, \"\\nFräulein!\\n Zwei neu bier!\\n\"\\nSomewhere along in here the fog\\n rolled in. When it rolled out again,\\n I found myself closing one eye the\\n better to read the lettering on my\\n earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu.\\n Somehow we\\'d evidently\\n navigated from one tent to another.\\n\\n\\n Arth was saying, \"Where\\'s your\\n hotel?\"\\n\\n\\n That seemed like a good question.\\n I thought about it for a while. Finally\\n I said, \"Haven\\'t got one. Town\\'s\\n jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.\\n I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever make\\n it, Arth. How many we got to\\n go?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can\\n come home with me.\"\\n\\n\\n We drank to that and the fog rolled\\n in again.\\n\\n\\n When the fog rolled out, it was\\n daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.\\n I was sprawled, complete with\\n clothes, on one of twin beds. On the\\n other bed, also completely clothed,\\n was Arth.\\n\\n\\n That sun was too much. I stumbled\\n up from the bed, staggered to\\n the window and fumbled around for\\n a blind or curtain. There was none.\\n\\n\\n Behind me a voice said in horror,\\n \"Who ... how ... oh,\\nWodo\\n,\\n where\\'d you come from?\"\\n\\n\\n I got a quick impression, looking\\n out the window, that the Germans\\n were certainly the most modern, futuristic\\n people in the world. But I\\n couldn\\'t stand the light. \"Where\\'s\\n the shade,\" I moaned.\\n\\n\\n Arth did something and the window\\n went opaque.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s quite a gadget,\" I groaned.\\n \"If I didn\\'t feel so lousy, I\\'d\\n appreciate it.\"\\n\\n\\n Arth was sitting on the edge of\\n the bed holding his bald head in his\\n hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.\\n \"You didn\\'t have a hotel.\\n What a stupidity. I\\'ll be phased.\\n Phased all the way down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You haven\\'t got a handful of\\n aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering\\n erect and heading for what\\n undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay\\n where you are. Don\\'t move. Don\\'t\\n touch anything.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.\\n \"I\\'m clean. I won\\'t mess up the\\n place. All I\\'ve got is a hangover, not\\n lice.\"\\n\\n\\n Arth was gone. He came back in\\n two or three minutes, box of pills in\\n hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\\n\\n\\n I took the pill, followed it with a\\n glass of water.\\nAnd went out like a light.\\n\\n\\n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want\\n another\\nmass\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n The band was blaring, and five\\n thousand half-swacked voices were\\n roaring accompaniment.\\nIn Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!\\nEins, Zwei, G\\'sufa!\\nAt the\\nG\\'sufa\\neverybody upped\\n with their king-size mugs and drank\\n each other\\'s health.\\n\\n\\n My head was killing me. \"This is\\n where I came in, or something,\" I\\n groaned.\\n\\n\\n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"\\n He looked at me over the rim of his\\n beer mug.\\n\\n\\n Something, somewhere, was\\n wrong. But I didn\\'t care. I finished\\n my\\nmass\\nand then remembered. \"I\\'ve\\n got to get my bag. Oh, my head.\\n Where did we spend last night?\"\\n\\n\\n Arth said, and his voice sounded\\n cautious, \"At my hotel, don\\'t you remember?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I\\n feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.\\n I\\'ve got to go to the Bahnhof and\\n get my luggage.\"\\n\\n\\n Arth didn\\'t put up an argument\\n on that. We said good-by and I could\\n feel him watching after me as I pushed\\n through the tables on the way\\n out.\\n\\n\\n At the Bahnhof they could do me\\n no good. There were no hotel rooms\\n available in Munich. The head was\\n getting worse by the minute. The\\n fact that they\\'d somehow managed\\n to lose my bag didn\\'t help. I worked\\n on that project for at least a couple\\n of hours. Not only wasn\\'t the bag\\n at the luggage checking station, but\\n the attendant there evidently couldn\\'t\\n make heads nor tails of the check\\n receipt. He didn\\'t speak English and\\n my high school German was inadequate,\\n especially accompanied by a\\n blockbusting hangover.\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t get anywhere tearing my\\n hair and complaining from one end\\n of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew\\n a blank on the bag.\\n\\n\\n And the head was getting worse\\n by the minute. I was bleeding to\\n death through the eyes and instead\\n of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\\n Believe me,\\nnobody\\nshould drink\\n a gallon or more of Marzenbräu.\\nI decided the hell with it. I took\\n a cab to the airport, presented my return\\n ticket, told them I wanted to\\n leave on the first obtainable plane to\\n New York. I\\'d spent two days at the\\nOktoberfest\\n, and I\\'d had it.\\n\\n\\n I got more guff there. Something\\n was wrong with the ticket, wrong\\n date or some such. But they fixed\\n that up. I never was clear on what\\n was fouled up, some clerk\\'s error,\\n evidently.\\n\\n\\n The trip back was as uninteresting\\n as the one over. As the hangover began\\n to wear off—a little—I was almost\\n sorry I hadn\\'t been able to stay.\\n If I\\'d only been able to get a room I\\nwould\\nhave stayed, I told myself.\\n\\n\\n From Idlewild, I came directly to\\n the office rather than going to my\\n apartment. I figured I might as well\\n check in with Betty.\\n\\n\\n I opened the door and there I\\n found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair\\n he had been occupying four—or was\\n it five—days before when I\\'d left.\\n I\\'d lost track of the time.\\n\\n\\n I said to him, \"Glad you\\'re here,\\n sir. I can report. Ah, what was it\\n you came for? Impatient to hear if\\n I\\'d had any results?\" My mind was\\n spinning like a whirling dervish in\\n a revolving door. I\\'d spent a wad of\\n his money and had nothing I could\\n think of to show for it; nothing but\\n the last stages of a grand-daddy\\n hangover.\\n\\n\\n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.\\n \"I\\'m merely waiting for your girl to\\n make out my receipt. I thought you\\n had already left.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll miss your plane,\" Betty\\n said.\\n\\n\\n There was suddenly a double dip\\n of ice cream in my stomach. I walked\\n over to my desk and looked down at\\n the calendar.\\n\\n\\n Mr. Oyster was saying something\\n to the effect that if I didn\\'t leave today,\\n it would have to be tomorrow,\\n that he hadn\\'t ponied up that thousand\\n dollars advance for anything\\n less than immediate service. Stuffing\\n his receipt in his wallet, he fussed\\n his way out the door.\\n\\n\\n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose\\n you haven\\'t changed this calendar\\n since I left.\"\\n\\n\\n Betty said, \"What\\'s the matter\\n with you? You look funny. How did\\n your clothes get so mussed? You tore\\n the top sheet off that calendar yourself,\\n not half an hour ago, just before\\n this marble-missing client came\\n in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time\\n travelers yet.\"\\n\\n\\n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when\\n did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never saw him before in my\\n life,\" she said. \"Not until he came\\n in this morning.\"\\n\\n\\n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\\n\\n\\n While Betty stared at me as though\\n it was\\nme\\nthat needed candling by a\\n head shrinker preparatory to being\\n sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished\\n in my pocket for my wallet, counted\\n the contents and winced at the\\n pathetic remains of the thousand.\\n I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,\\n how long ago did I go out that door—on\\n the way to the airport?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been acting sick all morning.\\n You went out that door about\\n ten minutes ago, were gone about\\n three minutes, and then came back.\"\\n\"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32minterrupting\\n Simon\\'s story\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, \"did you\\n say this was supposed to be amusing,\\n young man? I don\\'t find it so. In\\n fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\\n\\n\\n Simon shrugged, put one hand to\\n his forehead and said, \"That\\'s only\\n the first chapter. There are two\\n more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not interested in more,\" Mr.\\n Oyster said. \"I suppose your point\\n was to show me how ridiculous the\\n whole idea actually is. Very well,\\n you\\'ve done it. Confound it. However,\\n I suppose your time, even when\\n spent in this manner, has some value.\\n Here is fifty dollars. And good day,\\n sir!\"\\n\\n\\n He slammed the door after him\\n as he left.\\n\\n\\n Simon winced at the noise, took\\n the aspirin bottle from its drawer,\\n took two, washed them down with\\n water from the desk carafe.\\n\\n\\n Betty looked at him admiringly.\\n Came to her feet, crossed over and\\n took up the fifty dollars. \"Week\\'s\\n wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that\\'s\\n one way of taking care of a crackpot.\\n But I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t\\n take his money and enjoy that vacation\\n you\\'ve been yearning about.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three\\n times.\"\\n\\n\\n Betty stared at him. \"You mean—\"\\n\\n\\n Simon nodded, miserably.\\n\\n\\n She said, \"But\\nSimon\\n. Fifty thousand\\n dollars bonus. If that story was\\n true, you should have gone back\\n again to Munich. If there was one\\n time traveler, there might have\\n been—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said\\n bitterly, \"I went back there three\\n times. There were hundreds of them.\\n Probably thousands.\" He took a deep\\n breath. \"Listen, we\\'re just going to\\n have to forget about it. They\\'re not\\n going to stand for the space-time\\n continuum track being altered. If\\n something comes up that looks like\\n it might result in the track being\\n changed, they set you right back at\\n the beginning and let things start—for\\n you—all over again.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nSome men just haven\\'t got good sense. They just can\\'t seem to\\n learn the most fundamental things. Like when there\\'s no use\\n trying—when it\\'s time to give up because it\\'s hopeless....\\nThe meteor, a pebble, a little larger than a match head, traveled\\n through space and time since it came into being. The light from the star\\n that died when the meteor was created fell on Earth before the first\\n lungfish ventured from the sea.\\n\\n\\n In its last instant, the meteor fell on the Moon. It was impeded by\\n Evans\\' tractor.\\n\\n\\n It drilled a small, neat hole through the casing of the steam turbine,\\n and volitized upon striking the blades. Portions of the turbine also\\n volitized; idling at eight thousand RPM, it became unstable. The shaft\\n tried to tie itself into a knot, and the blades, damaged and undamaged\\n were spit through the casing. The turbine again reached a stable state,\\n that is, stopped. Permanently stopped.\\n\\n\\n It was two days to sunrise, where Evans stood.\\n\\n\\n It was just before sunset on a spring evening in September in Sydney.\\n The shadow line between day and night could be seen from the Moon to be\\n drifting across Australia.\\n\\n\\n Evans, who had no watch, thought of the time as a quarter after\\n Australia.\\n\\n\\n Evans was a prospector, and like all prospectors, a sort of jackknife\\n geologist, selenologist, rather. His tractor and equipment cost two\\n hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand was paid for. The\\n rest was promissory notes and grubstake shares. When he was broke, which\\n was usually, he used his tractor to haul uranium ore and metallic sodium\\n from the mines at Potter\\'s dike to Williamson Town, where the rockets\\n landed.\\n\\n\\n When he was flush, he would prospect for a couple of weeks. Once he\\n followed a stampede to Yellow Crater, where he thought for a while that\\n he had a fortune in chromium. The chromite petered out in a month and a\\n half, and he was lucky to break even.\\n\\n\\n Evans was about three hundred miles east of Williamson Town, the site of\\n the first landing on the Moon.\\n\\n\\n Evans was due back at Williamson Town at about sunset, that is, in about\\n sixteen days. When he saw the wrecked turbine, he knew that he wouldn\\'t\\n make it. By careful rationing, he could probably stretch his food out to\\n more than a month. His drinking water—kept separate from the water in\\n the reactor—might conceivably last just as long. But his oxygen was too\\n carefully measured; there was a four-day reserve. By diligent\\n conservation, he might make it last an extra day. Four days\\n reserve—plus one is five—plus sixteen days normal supply equals\\n twenty-one days to live.\\n\\n\\n In seventeen days he might be missed, but in seventeen days it would be\\n dark again, and the search for him, if it ever began, could not begin\\n for thirteen more days. At the earliest it would be eight days too late.\\n\"Well, man, \\'tis a fine spot you\\'re in now,\" he told himself.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s find out how bad it is indeed,\" he answered. He reached for the\\n light switch and tried to turn it on. The switch was already in the \"on\"\\n position.\\n\\n\\n \"Batteries must be dead,\" he told himself.\\n\\n\\n \"What batteries?\" he asked. \"There\\'re no batteries in here, the power\\n comes from the generator.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why isn\\'t the generator working, man?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n He thought this one out carefully. The generator was not turned by the\\n main turbine, but by a small reciprocating engine. The steam, however,\\n came from the same boiler. And the boiler, of course, had emptied itself\\n through the hole in the turbine. And the condenser, of course—\\n\\n\\n \"The condenser!\" he shouted.\\n\\n\\n He fumbled for a while, until he found a small flashlight. By the light\\n of this, he reinspected the steam system, and found about three gallons\\n of water frozen in the condenser. The condenser, like all condensers,\\n was a device to convert steam into water, so that it could be reused in\\n the boiler. This one had a tank and coils of tubing in the center of a\\n curved reflector that was positioned to radiate the heat of the steam\\n into the cold darkness of space. When the meteor pierced the turbine,\\n the water in the condenser began to boil. This boiling lowered the\\n temperature, and the condenser demonstrated its efficiency by quickly\\n freezing the water in the tank.\\n\\n\\n Evans sealed the turbine from the rest of the steam system by closing\\n the shut-off valves. If there was any water in the boiler, it would\\n operate the engine that drove the generator. The water would condense in\\n the condenser, and with a little luck, melt the ice in there. Then, if\\n the pump wasn\\'t blocked by ice, it would return the water to the boiler.\\n\\n\\n But there was no water in the boiler. Carefully he poured a cup of his\\n drinking water into a pipe that led to the boiler, and resealed the\\n pipe. He pulled on a knob marked \"Nuclear Start/Safety Bypass.\" The\\n water that he had poured into the boiler quickly turned into steam, and\\n the steam turned the generator briefly.\\n\\n\\n Evans watched the lights flicker and go out, and he guessed what the\\n trouble was.\\n\\n\\n \"The water, man,\" he said, \"there is not enough to melt the ice in the\\n condenser.\"\\n\\n\\n He opened the pipe again and poured nearly a half-gallon of water into\\n the boiler. It was three days\\' supply of water, if it had been carefully\\n used. It was one day\\'s supply if used wastefully. It was ostentatious\\n luxury for a man with a month\\'s supply of water and twenty-one days to\\n live.\\n\\n\\n The generator started again, and the lights came on. They flickered as\\n the boiler pressure began to fail, but the steam had melted some of the\\n ice in the condenser, and the water pump began to function.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, man,\" he breathed, \"there\\'s a light to die by.\"\\nThe sun rose on Williamson Town at about the same time it rose on Evans.\\n It was an incredibly brilliant disk in a black sky. The stars next to\\n the sun shone as brightly as though there were no sun. They might have\\n appeared to waver slightly, if they were behind outflung corona flares.\\n If they did, no one noticed. No one looked toward the sun without dark\\n filters.\\n\\n\\n When Director McIlroy came into his office, he found it lighted by the\\n rising sun. The light was a hot, brilliant white that seemed to pierce\\n the darkest shadows of the room. He moved to the round window, screening\\n his eyes from the light, and adjusted the polaroid shade to maximum\\n density. The sun became an angry red brown, and the room was dark again.\\n McIlroy decreased the density again until the room was comfortably\\n lighted. The room felt stuffy, so he decided to leave the door to the\\n inner office open.\\n\\n\\n He felt a little guilty about this, because he had ordered that all\\n doors in the survey building should remain closed except when someone\\n was passing through them. This was to allow the air-conditioning system\\n to function properly, and to prevent air loss in case of the highly\\n improbable meteor damage. McIlroy thought that on the whole, he was\\n disobeying his own orders no more flagrantly than anyone else in the\\n survey.\\n\\n\\n McIlroy had no illusions about his ability to lead men. Or rather, he\\n did have one illusion; he thought that he was completely unfit as a\\n leader. It was true that his strictest orders were disobeyed with\\n cheerful contempt, but it was also true his mildest requests were\\n complied with eagerly and smoothly.\\n\\n\\n Everyone in the survey except McIlroy realized this, and even he\\n accepted this without thinking about it. He had fallen into the habit of\\n suggesting mildly anything that he wanted done, and writing orders he\\n didn\\'t particularly care to have obeyed.\\n\\n\\n For example, because of an order of his stating that there would be no\\n alcoholic beverages within the survey building, the entire survey was\\n assured of a constant supply of home-made, but passably good liquor.\\n Even McIlroy enjoyed the surreptitious drinking.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning, Mr. McIlroy,\" said Mrs. Garth, his secretary. Morning to\\n Mrs. Garth was simply the first four hours after waking.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning indeed,\" answered McIlroy. Morning to him had no meaning\\n at all, but he thought in the strictest sense that it would be morning\\n on the Moon for another week.\\n\\n\\n \"Has the power crew set up the solar furnace?\" he asked. The solar\\n furnace was a rough parabola of mirrors used to focus the sun\\'s heat on\\n anything that it was desirable to heat. It was used mostly, from sun-up\\n to sun-down, to supplement the nuclear power plant.\\n\\n\\n \"They went out about an hour ago,\" she answered, \"I suppose that\\'s what\\n they were going to do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very good, what\\'s first on the schedule?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A Mr. Phelps to see you,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"How do you do, Mr. Phelps,\" McIlroy greeted him.\\n\\n\\n \"Good afternoon,\" Mr. Phelps replied. \"I\\'m here representing the\\n Merchants\\' Bank Association.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine,\" McIlroy said, \"I suppose you\\'re here to set up a bank.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, I just got in from Muroc last night, and I\\'ve been going\\n over the assets of the Survey Credit Association all morning.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll certainly be glad to get them off my hands,\" McIlroy said. \"I hope\\n they\\'re in good order.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There doesn\\'t seem to be any profit,\" Mr. Phelps said.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s par for a nonprofit organization,\" said McIlroy. \"But we\\'re\\n amateurs, and we\\'re turning this operation over to professionals. I\\'m\\n sure it will be to everyone\\'s satisfaction.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know this seems like a silly question. What day is this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" said McIlroy, \"that\\'s not so silly. I don\\'t know either.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Garth,\" he called, \"what day is this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, September, I think,\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n \"I mean what\\nday\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know, I\\'ll call the observatory.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a pause.\\n\\n\\n \"They say what day where?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Greenwich, I guess, our official time is supposed to be Greenwich Mean\\n Time.\"\\n\\n\\n There was another pause.\\n\\n\\n \"They say it\\'s September fourth, one thirty\\n a.m.\\n \"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, there you are,\" laughed McIlroy, \"it isn\\'t that time doesn\\'t mean\\n anything here, it just doesn\\'t mean the same thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Phelps joined the laughter. \"Bankers\\' hours don\\'t mean much, at any\\n rate,\" he said.\\nThe power crew was having trouble with the solar furnace. Three of the\\n nine banks of mirrors would not respond to the electric controls, and\\n one bank moved so jerkily that it could not be focused, and it\\n threatened to tear several of the mirrors loose.\\n\\n\\n \"What happened here?\" Spotty Cade, one of the electrical technicians\\n asked his foreman, Cowalczk, over the intercommunications radio. \"I\\'ve\\n got about a hundred pinholes in the cables out here. It\\'s no wonder they\\n don\\'t work.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Meteor shower,\" Cowalczk answered, \"and that\\'s not half of it. Walker\\n says he\\'s got a half dozen mirrors cracked or pitted, and Hoffman on\\n bank three wants you to replace a servo motor. He says the bearing was\\n hit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When did it happen?\" Cade wanted to know.\\n\\n\\n \"Must have been last night, at least two or three days ago. All of \\'em\\n too small for Radar to pick up, and not enough for Seismo to get a\\n rumble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sounds pretty bad.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Could have been worse,\" said Cowalczk.\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wasn\\'t anybody out in it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, Chuck,\" another technician, Lehman, broke in, \"you could maybe get\\n hurt that way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I doubt it,\" Cowalczk answered, \"most of these were pinhead size, and\\n they wouldn\\'t go through a suit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It would take a pretty big one to damage a servo bearing,\" Cade\\n commented.\\n\\n\\n \"That could hurt,\" Cowalczk admitted, \"but there was only one of them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean only one hit our gear,\" Lehman said. \"How many missed?\"\\n\\n\\n Nobody answered. They could all see the Moon under their feet. Small\\n craters overlapped and touched each other. There was—except in the\\n places that men had obscured them with footprints—not a square foot\\n that didn\\'t contain a crater at least ten inches across, there was not a\\n square inch without its half-inch crater. Nearly all of these had been\\n made millions of years ago, but here and there, the rim of a crater\\n covered part of a footprint, clear evidence that it was a recent one.\\nAfter the sun rose, Evans returned to the lava cave that he had been\\n exploring when the meteor hit. Inside, he lifted his filter visor, and\\n found that the light reflected from the small ray that peered into the\\n cave door lighted the cave adequately. He tapped loose some white\\n crystals on the cave wall with his geologist\\'s hammer, and put them into\\n a collector\\'s bag.\\n\\n\\n \"A few mineral specimens would give us something to think about, man.\\n These crystals,\" he said, \"look a little like zeolites, but that can\\'t\\n be, zeolites need water to form, and there\\'s no water on the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n He chipped a number of other crystals loose and put them in bags. One of\\n them he found in a dark crevice had a hexagonal shape that puzzled him.\\n\\n\\n One at a time, back in the tractor, he took the crystals out of the bags\\n and analyzed them as well as he could without using a flame which would\\n waste oxygen. The ones that looked like zeolites were zeolites, all\\n right, or something very much like it. One of the crystals that he\\n thought was quartz turned out to be calcite, and one of the ones that he\\n was sure could be nothing but calcite was actually potassium nitrate.\\n\"Well, now,\" he said, \"it\\'s probably the largest natural crystal of\\n potassium nitrate that anyone has ever seen. Man, it\\'s a full inch\\n across.\"\\n\\n\\n All of these needed water to form, and their existence on the Moon\\n puzzled him for a while. Then he opened the bag that had contained the\\n unusual hexagonal crystals, and the puzzle resolved itself. There was\\n nothing in the bag but a few drops of water. What he had taken to be a\\n type of rock was ice, frozen in a niche that had never been warmed by\\n the sun.\\nThe sun rose to the meridian slowly. It was a week after sunrise. The\\n stars shone coldly, and wheeled in their slow course with the sun. Only\\n Earth remained in the same spot in the black sky. The shadow line crept\\n around until Earth was nearly dark, and then the rim of light appeared\\n on the opposite side. For a while Earth was a dark disk in a thin halo,\\n and then the light came to be a crescent, and the line of dawn began to\\n move around Earth. The continents drifted across the dark disk and into\\n the crescent. The people on Earth saw the full moon set about the same\\n time that the sun rose.\\nNickel Jones was the captain of a supply rocket. He made trips from and\\n to the Moon about once a month, carrying supplies in and metal and ores\\n out. At this time he was visiting with his old friend McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"I swear, Mac,\" said Jones, \"another season like this, and I\\'m going\\n back to mining.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought you were doing pretty well,\" said McIlroy, as he poured two\\n drinks from a bottle of Scotch that Jones had brought him.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, the money I like, but I will say that I\\'d have more if I didn\\'t\\n have to fight the union and the Lunar Trade Commission.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy had heard all of this before. \"How\\'s that?\" he asked politely.\\n\\n\\n \"You may think it\\'s myself running the ship,\" Jones started on his\\n tirade, \"but it\\'s not. The union it is that says who I can hire. The\\n union it is that says how much I must pay, and how large a crew I need.\\n And then the Commission ...\" The word seemed to give Jones an unpleasant\\n taste in his mouth, which he hurriedly rinsed with a sip of Scotch.\\n\\n\\n \"The Commission,\" he continued, making the word sound like an obscenity,\\n \"it is that tells me how much I can charge for freight.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy noticed that his friend\\'s glass was empty, and he quietly filled\\n it again.\\n\\n\\n \"And then,\" continued Jones, \"if I buy a cargo up here, the Commission\\n it is that says what I\\'ll sell it for. If I had my way, I\\'d charge only\\n fifty cents a pound for freight instead of the dollar forty that the\\n Commission insists on. That\\'s from here to Earth, of course. There\\'s no\\n profit I could make by cutting rates the other way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not?\" asked McIlroy. He knew the answer, but he liked to listen to\\n the slightly Welsh voice of Jones.\\n\\n\\n \"Near cost it is now at a dollar forty. But what sense is there in\\n charging the same rate to go either way when it takes about a seventh of\\n the fuel to get from here to Earth as it does to get from there to\\n here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What good would it do to charge fifty cents a pound?\" asked McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"The nickel, man, the tons of nickel worth a dollar and a half on Earth,\\n and not worth mining here; the low-grade ores of uranium and vanadium,\\n they need these things on Earth, but they can\\'t get them as long as it\\n isn\\'t worth the carrying of them. And then, of course, there\\'s the water\\n we haven\\'t got. We could afford to bring more water for more people, and\\n set up more distilling plants if we had the money from the nickel.\\n\\n\\n \"Even though I say it who shouldn\\'t, two-eighty a quart is too much to\\n pay for water.\"\\n\\n\\n Both men fell silent for a while. Then Jones spoke again:\\n\\n\\n \"Have you seen our friend Evans lately? The price of chromium has gone\\n up, and I think he could ship some of his ore from Yellow Crater at a\\n profit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s out prospecting again. I don\\'t expect to see him until sun-down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll likely see him then. I won\\'t be loaded for another week and a\\n half. Can\\'t you get in touch with him by radio?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He isn\\'t carrying one. Most of the prospectors don\\'t. They claim that a\\n radio that won\\'t carry beyond the horizon isn\\'t any good, and one that\\n will bounce messages from Earth takes up too much room.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if I don\\'t see him, you let him know about the chromium.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anything to help another Welshman, is that the idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, protection it is that a poor Welshman needs from all the English\\n and Scots. Speaking of which—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, of course,\" McIlroy grinned as he refilled the glasses.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSlainte, McIlroy, bach.\\n\" \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mHealth, McIlroy, man.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSlainte mhor, bach.\\n\" \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mGreat Health, man.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe sun was halfway to the horizon, and Earth was a crescent in the sky\\n when Evans had quarried all the ice that was available in the cave. The\\n thought grew on him as he worked that this couldn\\'t be the only such\\n cave in the area. There must be several more bubbles in the lava flow.\\n\\n\\n Part of his reasoning proved correct. That is, he found that by\\n chipping, he could locate small bubbles up to an inch in diameter, each\\n one with its droplet of water. The average was about one per cent of the\\n volume of each bubble filled with ice.\\n\\n\\n A quarter of a mile from the tractor, Evans found a promising looking\\n mound of lava. It was rounded on top, and it could easily be the dome of\\n a bubble. Suddenly, Evans noticed that the gauge on the oxygen tank of\\n his suit was reading dangerously near empty. He turned back to his\\n tractor, moving as slowly as he felt safe in doing. Running would use up\\n oxygen too fast. He was halfway there when the pressure warning light\\n went on, and the signal sounded inside his helmet. He turned on his\\n ten-minute reserve supply, and made it to the tractor with about five\\n minutes left. The air purifying apparatus in the suit was not as\\n efficient as the one in the tractor; it wasted oxygen. By using the suit\\n so much, Evans had already shortened his life by several days. He\\n resolved not to leave the tractor again, and reluctantly abandoned his\\n plan to search for a large bubble.\\nThe sun stood at half its diameter above the horizon. The shadows of the\\n mountains stretched out to touch the shadows of the other mountains. The\\n dawning line of light covered half of Earth, and Earth turned beneath\\n it.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk itched under his suit, and the sweat on his face prickled\\n maddeningly because he couldn\\'t reach it through his helmet. He pushed\\n his forehead against the faceplate of his helmet and rubbed off some of\\n the sweat. It didn\\'t help much, and it left a blurred spot in his\\n vision. That annoyed him.\\n\\n\\n \"Is everyone clear of the outlet?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"All clear,\" he heard Cade report through the intercom.\\n\\n\\n \"How come we have to blow the boilers now?\" asked Lehman.\\n\\n\\n \"Because I say so,\" Cowalczk shouted, surprised at his outburst and\\n ashamed of it. \"Boiler scale,\" he continued, much calmer. \"We\\'ve got to\\n clean out the boilers once a year to make sure the tubes in the reactor\\n don\\'t clog up.\" He squinted through his dark visor at the reactor\\n building, a gray concrete structure a quarter of a mile distant. \"It\\n would be pretty bad if they clogged up some night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pressure\\'s ten and a half pounds,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Right, let her go,\" said Cowalczk.\\n\\n\\n Cade threw a switch. In the reactor building, a relay closed. A motor\\n started turning, and the worm gear on the motor opened a valve on the\\n boiler. A stream of muddy water gushed into a closed vat. When the vat\\n was about half full, the water began to run nearly clear. An electric\\n eye noted that fact and a light in front of Cade turned on. Cade threw\\n the switch back the other way, and the relay in the reactor building\\n opened. The motor turned and the gears started to close the valve. But a\\n fragment of boiler scale held the valve open.\\n\\n\\n \"Valve\\'s stuck,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Open it and close it again,\" said Cowalczk. The sweat on his forehead\\n started to run into his eyes. He banged his hand on his faceplate in an\\n unconscious attempt to wipe it off. He cursed silently, and wiped it off\\n on the inside of his helmet again. This time, two drops ran down the\\n inside of his faceplate.\\n\\n\\n \"Still don\\'t work,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Keep trying,\" Cowalczk ordered. \"Lehman, get a Geiger counter and come\\n with me, we\\'ve got to fix this thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Lehman and Cowalczk, who were already suited up started across to the\\n reactor building. Cade, who was in the pressurized control room without\\n a suit on, kept working the switch back and forth. There was light that\\n indicated when the valve was open. It was on, and it stayed on, no\\n matter what Cade did.\\n\\n\\n \"The vat pressure\\'s too high,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n \"Let me know when it reaches six pounds,\" Cowalczk requested. \"Because\\n it\\'ll probably blow at seven.\"\\n\\n\\n The vat was a light plastic container used only to decant sludge out of\\n the water. It neither needed nor had much strength.\\n\\n\\n \"Six now,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman stopped halfway to the reactor. The vat bulged and\\n ruptured. A stream of mud gushed out and boiled dry on the face of the\\n Moon. Cowalczk and Lehman rushed forward again.\\n\\n\\n They could see the trickle of water from the discharge pipe. The motor\\n turned the valve back and forth in response to Cade\\'s signals.\\n\"What\\'s going on out there?\" demanded McIlroy on the intercom.\\n\\n\\n \"Scale stuck in the valve,\" Cowalczk answered.\\n\\n\\n \"Are the reactors off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Vat blew. Shut up! Let me work, Mac!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" McIlroy said, realizing that this was no time for officials.\\n \"Let me know when it\\'s fixed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Geiger\\'s off scale,\" Lehman said.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re probably O.K. in these suits for an hour,\" Cowalczk answered. \"Is\\n there a manual shut-off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not that I know of,\" Lehman answered. \"What about it, Cade?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think so,\" Cade said. \"I\\'ll get on the blower and rouse out an\\n engineer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K., but keep working that switch.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I checked the line as far as it\\'s safe,\" said Lehman. \"No valve.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" Cowalczk said. \"Listen, Cade, are the injectors still on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah. There\\'s still enough heat in these reactors to do some damage.\\n I\\'ll cut \\'em in about fifteen minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve found the trouble,\" Lehman said. \"The worm gear\\'s loose on its\\n shaft. It\\'s slipping every time the valve closes. There\\'s not enough\\n power in it to crush the scale.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right,\" Cowalczk said. \"Cade, open the valve wide. Lehman, hand me that\\n pipe wrench!\"\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk hit the shaft with the back of the pipe wrench, and it broke at\\n the motor bearing.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman fitted the pipe wrench to the gear on the valve, and\\n turned it.\\n\\n\\n \"Is the light off?\" Cowalczk asked.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Cade answered.\\n\\n\\n \"Water\\'s stopped. Give us some pressure, we\\'ll see if it holds.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Twenty pounds,\" Cade answered after a couple of minutes.\\n\\n\\n \"Take her up to ... no, wait, it\\'s still leaking,\" Cowalczk said. \"Hold\\n it there, we\\'ll open the valve again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" said Cade. \"An engineer here says there\\'s no manual cutoff.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like Hell,\" said Lehman.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman opened the valve again. Water spurted out, and\\n dwindled as they closed the valve.\\n\\n\\n \"What did you do?\" asked Cade. \"The light went out and came on again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Check that circuit and see if it works,\" Cowalczk instructed.\\n\\n\\n There was a pause.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s O.K.,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman opened and closed the valve again.\\n\\n\\n \"Light is off now,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Cowalczk, \"take the pressure up all the way, and we\\'ll see\\n what happens.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eight hundred pounds,\" Cade said, after a short wait.\\n\\n\\n \"Good enough,\" Cowalczk said. \"Tell that engineer to hold up a while, he\\n can fix this thing as soon as he gets parts. Come on, Lehman, let\\'s get\\n out of here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'m glad that\\'s over,\" said Cade. \"You guys had me worried for a\\n while.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Think we weren\\'t worried?\" Lehman asked. \"And it\\'s not over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" Cade asked. \"Oh, you mean the valve servo you two bashed up?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Lehman, \"I mean the two thousand gallons of water that we\\n lost.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two thousand?\" Cade asked. \"We only had seven hundred gallons reserve.\\n How come we can operate now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We picked up twelve hundred from the town sewage plant. What with using\\n the solar furnace as a radiator, we can make do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, God, I suppose this means water rationing again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re probably right, at least until the next rocket lands in a couple\\n of weeks.\"\\nPROSPECTOR FEARED LOST ON MOON\\n\\n\\n IPP Williamson Town, Moon, Sept. 21st. Scientific survey director\\n McIlroy released a statement today that Howard Evans, a prospector\\n is missing and presumed lost. Evans, who was apparently exploring\\n the Moon in search of minerals was due two days ago, but it was\\n presumed that he was merely temporarily delayed.\\n\\n\\n Evans began his exploration on August 25th, and was known to be\\n carrying several days reserve of oxygen and supplies. Director\\n McIlroy has expressed a hope that Evans will be found before his\\n oxygen runs out.\\n\\n\\n Search parties have started from Williamson Town, but telescopic\\n search from Palomar and the new satellite observatory are hindered\\n by the fact that Evans is lost on the part of the Moon which is now\\n dark. Little hope is held for radio contact with the missing man as\\n it is believed he was carrying only short-range,\\n intercommunications equipment. Nevertheless, receivers are ...\\n\\n\\n Captain Nickel Jones was also expressing a hope: \"Anyway, Mac,\" he was\\n saying to McIlroy, \"a Welshman knows when his luck\\'s run out. And never\\n a word did he say.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like as not, you\\'re right,\" McIlroy replied, \"but if I know Evans, he\\'d\\n never say a word about any forebodings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, happen I might have a bit of Welsh second sight about me, and it\\n tells me that Evans will be found.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy chuckled for the first time in several days. \"So that\\'s the\\n reason you didn\\'t take off when you were scheduled,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, yes,\" Jones answered. \"I thought that it might happen that a\\n rocket would be needed in the search.\"\\n\\n\\n The light from Earth lighted the Moon as the Moon had never lighted\\n Earth. The great blue globe of Earth, the only thing larger than the\\n stars, wheeled silently in the sky. As it turned, the shadow of sunset\\n crept across the face that could be seen from the Moon. From full Earth,\\n as you might say, it moved toward last quarter.\\n\\n\\n The rising sun shone into Director McIlroy\\'s office. The hot light\\n formed a circle on the wall opposite the window, and the light became\\n more intense as the sun slowly pulled over the horizon. Mrs. Garth\\n walked into the director\\'s office, and saw the director sleeping with\\n his head cradled in his arms on the desk. She walked softly to the\\n window and adjusted the shade to darken the office. She stood looking at\\n McIlroy for a moment, and when he moved slightly in his sleep, she\\n walked softly out of the office.\\n\\n\\n A few minutes later she was back with a cup of coffee. She placed it in\\n front of the director, and shook his shoulder gently.\\n\\n\\n \"Wake up, Mr. McIlroy,\" she said, \"you told me to wake you at sunrise,\\n and there it is, and here\\'s Mr. Phelps.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy woke up slowly. He leaned back in his chair and stretched. His\\n neck was stiff from sleeping in such an awkward position.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Morning, Mr. Phelps,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning,\" Phelps answered, dropping tiredly into a chair.\\n\\n\\n \"Have some coffee, Mr. Phelps,\" said Mrs. Garth, handing him a cup.\\n\\n\\n \"Any news?\" asked McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"About Evans?\" Phelps shook his head slowly. \"Palomar called in a few\\n minutes back. Nothing to report and the sun was rising there. Australia\\n will be in position pretty soon. Several observatories there. Then\\n Capetown. There are lots of observatories in Europe, but most of them\\n are clouded over. Anyway the satellite observatory will be in position\\n by the time Europe is.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy was fully awake. He glanced at Phelps and wondered how long it\\n had been since he had slept last. More than that, McIlroy wondered why\\n this banker, who had never met Evans, was losing so much sleep about\\n finding him. It began to dawn on McIlroy that nearly the whole\\n population of Williamson Town was involved, one way or another, in the\\n search.\\n\\n\\n The director turned to ask Phelps about this fact, but the banker was\\n slumped in his chair, fast asleep with his coffee untouched.\\n\\n\\n It was three hours later that McIlroy woke Phelps.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve found the tractor,\" McIlroy said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" Phelps mumbled, and then as comprehension came; \"That\\'s fine!\\n That\\'s just line! Is Evans—?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t tell yet. They spotted the tractor from the satellite\\n observatory. Captain Jones took off a few minutes ago, and he\\'ll report\\n back as soon as he lands. Hadn\\'t you better get some sleep?\"\\nEvans was carrying a block of ice into the tractor when he saw the\\n rocket coming in for a landing. He dropped the block and stood waiting.\\n When the dust settled from around the tail of the rocket, he started to\\n run forward. The air lock opened, and Evans recognized the vacuum suited\\n figure of Nickel Jones.\\n\\n\\n \"Evans, man!\" said Jones\\' voice in the intercom. \"Alive you are!\"\\n\\n\\n \"A Welshman takes a lot of killing,\" Evans answered.\\nLater, in Evans\\' tractor, he was telling his story:\\n\\n\\n \"... And I don\\'t know how long I sat there after I found the water.\" He\\n looked at the Goldburgian device he had made out of wire and tubing.\\n \"Finally I built this thing. These caves were made of lava.

Like the\\n decision \"I\\'ve had enough!\"\\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\\nRead locked the door and drew his pistol. Sergeant Rashid handed\\n Premier Umluana the warrant.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re from the UN Inspector Corps,\" Sergeant Rashid said. \"I\\'m\\n very sorry, but we have to arrest you and bring you in for trial\\n by the World Court.\"\\n\\n\\n If Umluana noticed Read\\'s gun, he didn\\'t show it. He read the\\n warrant carefully. When he finished, he said something in Dutch.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know your language,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n \"Then I\\'ll speak English.\" Umluana was a small man with wrinkled\\n brow, glasses and a mustache. His skin was a shade lighter than\\n Read\\'s. \"The Inspector General doesn\\'t have the power to arrest a\\n head of state—especially the Premier of Belderkan. Now, if\\n you\\'ll excuse me, I must return to my party.\"\\n\\n\\n In the other room people laughed and talked. Glasses clinked in\\n the late afternoon. Read knew two armed men stood just outside\\n the door. \"If you leave, Premier, I\\'ll have to shoot you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think so,\" Umluana said. \"No, if you kill me, all Africa\\n will rise against the world. You don\\'t want me dead. You want me\\n in court.\"\\n\\n\\n Read clicked off the safety.\\n\\n\\n \"Corporal Read is very young,\" Rashid said, \"but he\\'s a crack\\n shot. That\\'s why I brought him with me. I think he\\nlikes\\nto\\n shoot, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Umluana turned back to Rashid a second too soon. He saw the\\n sergeant\\'s upraised hand before it collided with his neck.\\n\\n\\n \"Help!\\nKidnap.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid judo chopped him and swung the inert body over his\\n shoulders. Read pulled a flat grenade from his vest pocket. He\\n dropped it and yellow psycho gas hissed from the valve.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s be off,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n The door lock snapped as they went out the window. Two men with\\n rifles plunged into the gas; sighing, they fell to the floor in a\\n catatonic trance.\\n\\n\\n A little car skimmed across the lawn. Bearing the Scourge of\\n Africa, Rashid struggled toward it. Read walked backward,\\n covering their retreat.\\n\\n\\n The car stopped, whirling blades holding it a few inches off the\\n lawn. They climbed in.\\n\\n\\n \"How did it go?\" The driver and another inspector occupied the\\n front seat.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll be after us in half a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n The other inspector carried a light machine gun and a box of\\n grenades. \"I better cover,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n The inspector slid out of the car and ran to a clump of bushes.\\n The driver pushed in the accelerator. As they swerved toward the\\n south, Read saw a dozen armed men run out of the house. A grenade\\n arced from the bushes and the pursuers recoiled from the cloud\\n that rose before them.\\n\\n\\n \"Is he all right?\" the driver asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I hurt him.\" Rashid took a syrette from his vest\\n pocket. \"Well, Read, it looks like we\\'re in for a fight. In a few\\n minutes Miaka Station will know we\\'re coming. And God knows what\\n will happen at the Game Preserve.\"\\n\\n\\n Read wanted to jump out of the car. He could die any minute. But\\n he had set his life on a well-oiled track and he couldn\\'t get off\\n until they reached Geneva.\\n\\n\\n \"They don\\'t know who\\'s coming,\" he said. \"They don\\'t make them\\n tough enough to stop this boy.\"\\n\\n\\n Staring straight ahead, he didn\\'t see the sergeant smile.\\nTwo types of recruits are accepted by the UN Inspector Corps:\\n those with a fanatic loyalty to the ideals of peace and world\\n order, and those who are loyal to nothing but themselves. Read\\n was the second type.\\n\\n\\n A tall, lanky Negro he had spent his school days in one of the\\n drab suburbs that ring every prosperous American city. It was the\\n home of factory workers, clerks, semiskilled technicians, all who\\n do the drudge work of civilization and know they will never do\\n more. The adults spent their days with television, alcohol and\\n drugs; the young spent their days with gangs, sex, television and\\n alcohol. What else was there? Those who could have told him\\n neither studied nor taught at his schools. What he saw on the\\n concrete fields between the tall apartment houses marked the\\n limits of life\\'s possibilities.\\n\\n\\n He had belonged to a gang called The Golden Spacemen. \"Nobody\\n fools with me,\" he bragged. \"When Harry Read\\'s out, there\\'s a\\n tiger running loose.\" No one knew how many times he nearly ran\\n from other clubs, how carefully he picked the safest spot on the\\n battle line.\\n\\n\\n \"A man ought to be a man,\" he once told a girl. \"He ought to do a\\n man\\'s work. Did you ever notice how our fathers look, how they\\n sleep so much? I don\\'t want to be like that. I want to be\\n something proud.\"\\n\\n\\n He joined the UN Inspector Corps at eighteen, in 1978. The\\n international cops wore green berets, high buttonless boots, bush\\n jackets. They were very special men.\\n\\n\\n For the first time in his life, his father said something about\\n his ambitions.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you like America, Harry? Do you\\nwant\\nto be without a\\n country? This is the best country in the world. All my life I\\'ve\\n made a good living. Haven\\'t you had everything you ever wanted?\\n I\\'ve been a king compared to people overseas. Why, you stay here\\n and go to trade school and in two years you\\'ll be living just\\n like me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t want that,\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, you don\\'t want that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You could join the American Army,\" his mother said. \"That\\'s as\\n good as a trade school. If you have to be a soldier.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want to be a UN man. I\\'ve already enlisted. I\\'m in! What do\\n you care what I do?\"\\n\\n\\n The UN Inspector Corps had been founded to enforce the Nuclear\\n Disarmament Treaty of 1966. Through the years it had acquired\\n other jobs. UN men no longer went unarmed. Trained to use small\\n arms and gas weapons, they guarded certain borders, bodyguarded\\n diplomats and UN officials, even put down riots that threatened\\n international peace. As the UN evolved into a strong world\\n government, the UN Inspector Corps steadily acquired new powers.\\n\\n\\n Read went through six months training on Madagascar.\\n\\n\\n Twice he nearly got expelled for picking fights with smaller men.\\n Rather than resign, he accepted punishment which assigned him to\\n weeks of dull, filthy extra labor. He hated the restrictions and\\n the iron fence of regulations. He hated boredom, loneliness and\\n isolation.\\n\\n\\n And yet he responded with enthusiasm. They had given him a job. A\\n job many people considered important.\\n\\n\\n He took his turn guarding the still disputed borders of Korea. He\\n served on the rescue teams that patrol the busy Polar routes. He\\n mounted guard at the 1980 World\\'s Fair in Rangoon.\\n\\n\\n \"I liked Rangoon,\" he even told a friend. \"I even liked Korea.\\n But I think I liked the Pole job best. You sit around playing\\n cards and shooting the bull and then there\\'s a plane crash or\\n something and you go out and win a medal. That\\'s great for me.\\n I\\'m lazy and I like excitement.\"\\nOne power implied in the UN Charter no Secretary General or\\n Inspector General had ever tried to use. The power to arrest any\\n head of state whose country violated international law. Could the\\n World Court try and imprison a politician who had conspired to\\n attack another nation?\\n\\n\\n For years Africa had been called \"The South America of the Old\\n World.\" Revolution followed revolution. Colonies became\\n democracies. Democracies became dictatorships or dissolved in\\n civil war. Men planted bases on the moon and in four years,\\n 1978-82, ringed the world with matter transmitters; but the black\\n population of Africa still struggled toward political equality.\\n\\n\\n Umluana took control of Belderkan in 1979. The tiny, former Dutch\\n colony, had been a tottering democracy for ten years. The very\\n day he took control the new dictator and his African party began\\n to build up the Belderkan Army. For years he had preached a new\\n Africa, united, free of white masters, the home of a vigorous and\\n perfect Negro society. His critics called him a hypocritical\\n racist, an opportunist using the desires of the African people to\\n build himself an empire.\\n\\n\\n He began a propaganda war against neighboring South Africa,\\n promising the liberation of that strife-torn land. Most Negro\\n leaders, having just won representation in the South African\\n Parliament, told him to liberate his own country. They believed\\n they could use their first small voice in the government to win\\n true freedom for their people.\\n\\n\\n But the radio assault and the arms buildup continued. Early in\\n 1982, South Africa claimed the Belderkan Army exceeded the size\\n agreed to in the Disarmament Treaty. The European countries and\\n some African nations joined in the accusation. China called the\\n uproar a vicious slur on a new African nation. The United States\\n and Russia, trying not to get entangled, asked for more\\n investigation by the UN.\\n\\n\\n But the evidence was clear. Umluana was defying world law. If he\\n got away with it, some larger and more dangerous nation might\\n follow his precedent. And the arms race would begin again.\\n\\n\\n The Inspector General decided. They would enter Belderkan, arrest\\n Umluana and try him by due process before the World Court. If the\\n plan succeeded, mankind would be a long step farther from nuclear\\n war.\\n\\n\\n Read didn\\'t know much about the complicated political reasons for\\n the arrest. He liked the Corp and he liked being in the Corp. He\\n went where they sent him and did what they told him to do.\\nThe car skimmed above the tree-tops. The driver and his two\\n passengers scanned the sky.\\n\\n\\n A plane would have been a faster way to get out of the country.\\n But then they would have spent hours flying over Africa, with\\n Belderkan fighters in hot pursuit, other nations joining the\\n chase and the world uproar gaining volume. By transmitter, if all\\n went well, they could have Umluana in Geneva in an hour.\\n\\n\\n They were racing toward Miaka, a branch transmitter station. From\\n Miaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous\\n tourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on\\n the globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game\\n Preserve station and manning its controls.\\n\\n\\n They had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get\\n there before it could be defended.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s no military base near Miaka,\" Rashid said. \"We might get\\n there before the Belderkans.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Here comes our escort,\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n A big car rose from the jungle. This one had a recoilless rifle\\n mounted on the roof. The driver and the gunner waved and fell in\\n behind them.\\n\\n\\n \"One thing,\" Read said, \"I don\\'t think they\\'ll shoot at us while\\nhe\\'s\\nin the car.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be certain, corporal. All these strong-arm movements are\\n alike. I\\'ll bet Umluana\\'s lieutenants are hoping he\\'ll become a\\n dead legend. Then they can become live conquerors.\"\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid came from Cairo. He had degrees in science and\\n history from Cambridge but only the Corp gave him work that\\n satisfied his conscience. He hated war. It was that simple.\\n\\n\\n Read looked back. He saw three spots of sunlight about two\\n hundred feet up and a good mile behind.\\n\\n\\n \"Here they come, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid turned his head. He waved frantically. The two men in the\\n other car waved back.\\n\\n\\n \"Shall I duck under the trees?\" the driver asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet. Not until we have to.\"\\n\\n\\n Read fingered the machine gun he had picked up when he got in the\\n car. He had never been shot at. Twice he had faced an unarmed\\n mob, but a few shots had sent them running.\\n\\n\\n Birds flew screaming from their nests. Monkeys screeched and\\n threw things at the noisy, speeding cars. A little cloud of birds\\n surrounded each vehicle.\\n\\n\\n The escort car made a sharp turn and charged their pursuers. The\\n big rifle fired twice. Read saw the Belderkan cars scatter.\\n Suddenly machine-gun bullets cracked and whined beside him.\\n\\n\\n \"Evade,\" Rashid said. \"Don\\'t go down.\"\\n\\n\\n Without losing any forward speed, the driver took them straight\\n up. Read\\'s stomach bounced.\\n\\n\\n A shell exploded above them. The car rocked. He raised his eyes\\n and saw a long crack in the roof.\\n\\n\\n \"Hit the floor,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n They knelt on the cramped floor. Rashid put on his gas mask and\\n Read copied him. Umluana breathed like a furnace, still\\n unconscious from the injection Rashid had given him.\\nI can\\'t do anything\\n, Read thought.\\nThey\\'re too far away to\\n shoot back. All we can do is run.\\nThe sky was clear and blue. The jungle was a noisy bazaar of\\n color. In the distance guns crashed. He listened to shells\\n whistle by and the whipcrack of machine-gun bullets. The car\\n roller-coastered up and down. Every time a shell passed, he\\n crawled in waves down his own back.\\n\\n\\n Another explosion, this time very loud.\\n\\n\\n Rashid raised his eyes above the seat and looked out the rear\\n window. \"Two left. Keep down, Read.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t we go down?\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll get to Miaka before us.\"\\n\\n\\n He shut his eyes when he heard another loud explosion.\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid looked out the window again. He swore bitterly in\\n English and Egyptian. Read raised his head. The two cars behind\\n them weren\\'t fighting each other. A long way back the tree-tops\\n burned.\\n\\n\\n \"How much farther?\" Rashid said. The masks muffled their voices.\\n\\n\\n \"There it is now. Shall I take us right in?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think you\\'d better.\"\\nThe station was a glass diamond in a small clearing. The driver\\n slowed down, then crashed through the glass walls and hovered by\\n the transmitter booth.\\n\\n\\n Rashid opened the door and threw out two grenades. Read jumped\\n out and the two of them struggled toward the booth with Umluana.\\n The driver, pistol in hand, ran for the control panel.\\n\\n\\n There were three technicians in the station and no passengers.\\n All three panicked when the psycho gas enveloped them. They ran\\n howling for the jungle.\\n\\n\\n Through the window of his mask, Read saw their pursuers land in\\n the clearing. Machine-gun bullets raked the building. They got\\n Umluana in the booth and hit the floor. Read took aim and opened\\n fire on the largest car.\\n\\n\\n \"Now, I can shoot back,\" he said. \"Now we\\'ll see what they do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you ready, Rashid?\" yelled the driver.\\n\\n\\n \"Man, get us out of here!\"\\n\\n\\n The booth door shut. When it opened, they were at the Game\\n Preserve.\\n\\n\\n The station jutted from the side of a hill. A glass-walled\\n waiting room surrounded the bank of transmitter booths. Read\\n looked out the door and saw his first battlefield.\\n\\n\\n Directly in front of him, his head shattered by a bullet, a dead\\n inspector lay behind an overturned couch.\\n\\n\\n Read had seen dozens of training films taken during actual\\n battles or after atomic attacks. He had laughed when other\\n recruits complained. \"That\\'s the way this world is. You people\\n with the weak stomachs better get used to it.\"\\n\\n\\n Now he slid against the rear wall of the transmitter booth.\\n\\n\\n A wounded inspector crawled across the floor to the booth. Read\\n couldn\\'t see his wound, only the pain scratched on his face and\\n the blood he deposited on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Did you get Umluana?\" he asked Sergeant Rashid.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s in the booth. What\\'s going on?\" Rashid\\'s Middle East Oxford\\n seemed more clipped than ever.\\n\\n\\n \"They hit us with two companies of troops a few minutes ago. I\\n think half our men are wounded.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can we get out of here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They machine-gunned the controls.\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid swore. \"You heard him, Read! Get out there and help those\\n men.\"\\n\\n\\n He heard the screams of the wounded, the crack of rifles and\\n machine guns, all the terrifying noise of war. But since his\\n eighteenth year he had done everything his superiors told him to\\n do.\\n\\n\\n He started crawling toward an easy-chair that looked like good\\n cover. A bullet cracked above his head, so close he felt the\\n shock wave. He got up, ran panicky, crouched, and dove behind the\\n chair.\\n\\n\\n An inspector cracked the valve on a smoke grenade. A white fog\\n spread through the building. They could see anyone who tried to\\n rush them but the besiegers couldn\\'t pick out targets.\\n\\n\\n Above the noise, he heard Rashid.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m calling South Africa Station for a copter. It\\'s the only way\\n out of here. Until it comes, we\\'ve got to hold them back.\"\\n\\n\\n Read thought of the green beret he had stuffed in his pocket that\\n morning. He stuck it on his head and cocked it. He didn\\'t need\\n plain clothes anymore and he wanted to wear at least a part of\\n his uniform.\\n\\n\\n Bullets had completely shattered the wall in front of him. He\\n stared through the murk, across the broken glass. He was Corporal\\n Harry Read, UN Inspector Corps—a very special man. If he didn\\'t\\n do a good job here, he wasn\\'t the man he claimed to be. This\\n might be the only real test he would ever face.\\nHe heard a shout in rapid French. He turned to his right. Men in\\n red loincloths ran zigzagging toward the station. They carried\\n light automatic rifles. Half of them wore gas masks.\\n\\n\\n \"Shoot the masks,\" he yelled. \"Aim for the masks.\"\\n\\n\\n The machine gun kicked and chattered on his shoulder. He picked a\\n target and squeezed off a burst. Tensely, he hunted for another\\n mask. Three grenades arced through the air and yellow gas spread\\n across the battlefield. The attackers ran through it. A few yards\\n beyond the gas, some of them turned and ran for their own lines.\\n In a moment only half a dozen masked men still advanced. The\\n inspectors fired a long, noisy volley. When they stopped only\\n four attackers remained on their feet. And they were running for\\n cover.\\n\\n\\n The attackers had come straight up a road that led from the Game\\n Preserve to the station. They had not expected any resistance.\\n The UN men had already taken over the station, chased out the\\n passengers and technicians and taken up defense positions; they\\n had met the Belderkans with a dozen grenades and sent them\\n scurrying for cover. The fight so far had been vicious but\\n disorganized. But the Belderkans had a few hundred men and knew\\n they had wrecked the transmitter controls.\\n\\n\\n The first direct attack had been repulsed. They could attack many\\n more times and continue to spray the building with bullets. They\\n could also try to go around the hill and attack the station from\\n above; if they did, the inspectors had a good view of the hill\\n and should see them going up.\\n\\n\\n The inspectors had taken up good defensive positions. In spite of\\n their losses, they still had enough firepower to cover the area\\n surrounding the station.\\n\\n\\n Read surveyed his sector of fire. About two hundred yards to his\\n left, he saw the top of a small ditch. Using the ditch for cover,\\n the Belderkans could sneak to the top of the hill.\\n\\n\\n Gas grenades are only three inches long. They hold cubic yards of\\n gas under high pressure. Read unclipped a telescoping rod from\\n his vest pocket. He opened it and a pair of sights flipped up. A\\n thin track ran down one side.\\n\\n\\n He had about a dozen grenades left, three self-propelling. He\\n slid an SP grenade into the rod\\'s track and estimated windage and\\n range. Sighting carefully, not breathing, muscles relaxed, the\\n rod rock steady, he fired and lobbed the little grenade into the\\n ditch. He dropped another grenade beside it.\\n\\n\\n The heavy gas would lie there for hours.\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid ran crouched from man to man. He did what he\\n could to shield the wounded.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, corporal, how are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not too bad, sergeant. See that ditch out there? I put a little\\n gas in it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good work. How\\'s your ammunition?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A dozen grenades. Half a barrel of shells.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The copter will be here in half an hour. We\\'ll put Umluana on,\\n then try to save ourselves. Once he\\'s gone, I think we ought to\\n surrender.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How do you think they\\'ll treat us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That we\\'ll have to see.\"\\n\\n\\n An occasional bullet cracked and whined through the misty room.\\n Near him a man gasped frantically for air. On the sunny field a\\n wounded man screamed for help.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a garage downstairs,\" Rashid said. \"In case the copter\\n doesn\\'t get here on time, I\\'ve got a man filling wine bottles\\n with gasoline.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll stop them, Sarge. Don\\'t worry.\"\\nRashid ran off. Read stared across the green land and listened to\\n the pound of his heart. What were the Belderkans planning? A mass\\n frontal attack? To sneak in over the top of the hill?\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t think, anymore than a rabbit thinks when it lies hiding\\n from the fox or a panther thinks when it crouches on a branch\\n above the trail. His skin tightened and relaxed on his body.\\n\\n\\n \"Listen,\" said a German.\\n\\n\\n Far down the hill he heard the deep-throated rumble of a big\\n motor.\\n\\n\\n \"Armor,\" the German said.\\n\\n\\n The earth shook. The tank rounded the bend. Read watched the\\n squat, angular monster until its stubby gun pointed at the\\n station. It stopped less than two hundred yards away.\\n\\n\\n A loud-speaker blared.\\n\\n\\n ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\\n\\n ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\\n\\n YOU MAY THINK US SAVAGES\\n\\n BUT WE HAVE MODERN WEAPONS.\\n\\n WE HAVE ATOMIC WARHEADS,\\n\\n ALL GASES, ROCKETS\\n\\n AND FLAME THROWERS. IF\\n\\n YOU DO NOT SURRENDER\\n\\n OUR PREMIER, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.\\n\\n\\n\\n \"They know we don\\'t have any big weapons,\" Read said. \"They know\\n we have only gas grenades and small arms.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked nervously from side to side. They couldn\\'t bring the\\n copter in with that thing squatting out there.\\n\\n\\n A few feet away, sprawled behind a barricade of tables, lay a man\\n in advanced shock. His deadly white skin shone like ivory. They\\n wouldn\\'t even look like that. One nuclear shell from that gun and\\n they\\'d be vaporized. Or perhaps the tank had sonic projectors;\\n then the skin would peel off their bones. Or they might be\\n burned, or cut up by shrapnel, or gassed with some new mist their\\n masks couldn\\'t filter.\\n\\n\\n Read shut his eyes. All around him he heard heavy breathing,\\n mumbled comments, curses. Clothes rustled as men moved restlessly.\\n\\n\\n But already the voice of Sergeant Rashid resounded in the murky\\n room.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got to knock that thing out before the copter comes.\\n Otherwise, he can\\'t land. I have six Molotov cocktails here. Who\\n wants to go hunting with me?\"\\n\\n\\n For two years Read had served under Sergeant Rashid. To him, the\\n sergeant was everything a UN inspector should be. Rashid\\'s\\n devotion to peace had no limits.\\n\\n\\n Read\\'s psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good\\n enough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might\\n conflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required\\n something more than a hunger for self-respect.\\n\\n\\n Read had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had\\n watched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen\\n another inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this\\n building, lay battered men and dead men.\\n\\n\\n All UN inspectors. All part of his life.\\n\\n\\n And he was part of their life. Their blood, their sacrifice, and\\n pain, had become a part of him.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll take a cocktail, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that Read?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who else did you expect?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nobody. Anybody else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll go,\" the Frenchman said. \"Three should be enough. Give us a\\n good smoke screen.\"\\nRashid snapped orders. He put the German inspector in charge of\\n Umluana. Read, the Frenchman and himself, he stationed at\\n thirty-foot intervals along the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Remember,\" Rashid said. \"We have to knock out that gun.\"\\n\\n\\n Read had given away his machine gun. He held a gas-filled bottle\\n in each hand. His automatic nestled in its shoulder holster.\\n\\n\\n Rashid whistled.\\n\\n\\n Dozens of smoke grenades tumbled through the air. Thick mist\\n engulfed the tank. Read stood up and ran forward. He crouched but\\n didn\\'t zigzag. Speed counted most here.\\n\\n\\n Gunfire shook the hill. The Belderkans couldn\\'t see them but they\\n knew what was going on and they fired systematically into the\\n smoke.\\n\\n\\n Bullets ploughed the ground beside him. He raised his head and\\n found the dim silhouette of the tank. He tried not to think about\\n bullets ploughing through his flesh.\\n\\n\\n A bullet slammed into his hip. He fell on his back, screaming.\\n \"Sarge.\\nSarge.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m hit, too,\" Rashid said. \"Don\\'t stop if you can move.\"\\nListen to him. What\\'s he got, a sprained ankle?\\nBut he didn\\'t feel any pain. He closed his eyes and threw himself\\n onto his stomach. And nearly fainted from pain. He screamed and\\n quivered. The pain stopped. He stretched out his hands, gripping\\n the wine bottles, and inched forward. Pain stabbed him from\\n stomach to knee.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t move, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Read, you\\'ve got to. I think you\\'re the only—\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n Guns clattered. Bullets cracked.\\n\\n\\n \"Sergeant Rashid! Answer me.\"\\n\\n\\n He heard nothing but the lonely passage of the bullets in the\\n mist.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m a UN man,\" he mumbled. \"You people up there know what a UN\\n man is? You know what happens when you meet one?\"\\n\\n\\n When he reached the tank, he had another bullet in his right arm.\\n But they didn\\'t know he was coming and when you get within ten\\n feet of a tank, the men inside can\\'t see you.\\n\\n\\n He just had to stand up and drop the bottle down the gun barrel.\\n That was all—with a broken hip and a wounded right arm.\\n\\n\\n He knew they would see him when he stood up but he didn\\'t think\\n about that. He didn\\'t think about Sergeant Rashid, about the\\n complicated politics of Africa, about crowded market streets. He\\n had to kill the tank. That was all he thought about. He had\\n decided something in the world was more important than himself,\\n but he didn\\'t know it or realize the psychologists would be\\n surprised to see him do this. He had made many decisions in the\\n last few minutes. He had ceased to think about them or anything\\n else.\\n\\n\\n With his cigarette lighter, he lit the rag stuffed in the end of\\n the bottle.\\n\\n\\n Biting his tongue, he pulled himself up the front of the tank.\\n His long arm stretched for the muzzle of the gun. He tossed the\\n bottle down the dark throat.\\n\\n\\n As he fell, the machine-gun bullets hit him in the chest, then in\\n the neck. He didn\\'t feel them. He had fainted the moment he felt\\n the bottle leave his hand.\\n\\n\\n The copter landed ten minutes later. Umluana left in a shower of\\n bullets. A Russian private, the ranking man alive in the station,\\n surrendered the survivors to the Belderkans.\\nHis mother hung the Global Medal above the television set.\\n\\n\\n \"He must have been brave,\" she said. \"We had a fine son.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He was our only son,\" her husband said. \"What did he volunteer\\n for? Couldn\\'t somebody else have done it?\"\\n\\n\\n His wife started to cry. Awkwardly, he embraced her. He wondered\\n what his son had wanted that he couldn\\'t get at home.\\nTHE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Even the\\n sun was only a twinkle. But this\\n vast distance did not mean that\\n isolation could endure forever.\\n Instruments within the ship intercepted\\n radio broadcasts and,\\n within the hour, early TV signals.\\n Machines compiled dictionaries\\n and grammars and began\\n translating the major languages.\\n The history of the planet was\\n tabulated as facts became available.\\n\\n\\n The course of the ship changed\\n slightly; it was not much out of\\n the way to swing nearer Earth.\\n For days the two within the ship\\n listened and watched with little\\n comment. They had to decide\\n soon.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got to make or break,\"\\n said the first alien.\\n\\n\\n \"You know what I\\'m in favor\\n of,\" said the second.\\n\\n\\n \"I can guess,\" said Ethaniel,\\n who had spoken first. \"The place\\n is a complete mess. They\\'ve never\\n done anything except fight\\n each other—and invent better\\n weapons.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not what they\\'ve done,\"\\n said Bal, the second alien. \"It\\'s\\n what they\\'re going to do, with\\n that big bomb.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The more reason for stopping,\"\\n said Ethaniel. \"The big\\n bomb can destroy them. Without\\n our help they may do just that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I may remind you that in two\\n months twenty-nine days we\\'re\\n due in Willafours,\" said Bal.\\n \"Without looking at the charts\\n I can tell you we still have more\\n than a hundred light-years to\\n go.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A week,\" said Ethaniel. \"We\\n can spare a week and still get\\n there on time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A week?\" said Bal. \"To settle\\n their problems? They\\'ve had two\\n world wars in one generation\\n and that the third and final one\\n is coming up you can\\'t help feeling\\n in everything they do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It won\\'t take much,\" said\\n Ethaniel. \"The wrong diplomatic\\n move, or a trigger-happy soldier\\n could set it off. And it wouldn\\'t\\n have to be deliberate. A meteor\\n shower could pass over and their\\n clumsy instruments could interpret\\n it as an all-out enemy\\n attack.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Too bad,\" said Bal. \"We\\'ll\\n just have to forget there ever\\n was such a planet as Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Could you? Forget so many\\n people?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m doing it,\" said Bal. \"Just\\n give them a little time and they\\n won\\'t be here to remind me that\\n I have a conscience.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My memory isn\\'t convenient,\"\\n said Ethaniel. \"I ask you\\n to look at them.\"\\nBal rustled, flicking the screen\\n intently. \"Very much like ourselves,\"\\n he said at last. \"A bit\\n shorter perhaps, and most certainly\\n incomplete. Except for the\\n one thing they lack, and that\\'s\\n quite odd, they seem exactly like\\n us. Is that what you wanted me\\n to say?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is. The fact that they are\\n an incomplete version of ourselves\\n touches me. They actually\\n seem defenseless, though I suppose\\n they\\'re not.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Tough,\" said Bal. \"Nothing\\n we can do about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There is. We can give them\\n a week.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In a week we can\\'t negate\\n their entire history. We can\\'t\\n begin to undo the effect of the\\n big bomb.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t tell,\" said Ethaniel.\\n \"We can look things over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And then what? How much\\n authority do we have?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very little,\" conceded Ethaniel.\\n \"Two minor officials on the\\n way to Willafours—and we run\\n directly into a problem no one\\n knew existed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And when we get to Willafours\\n we\\'ll be busy. It will be a\\n long time before anyone comes\\n this way again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A very long time. There\\'s\\n nothing in this region of space\\n our people want,\" said Ethaniel.\\n \"And how long can Earth last?\\n Ten years? Even ten months?\\n The tension is building by the\\n hour.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What can I say?\" said Bal.\\n \"I suppose we can stop and look\\n them over. We\\'re not committing\\n ourselves by looking.\"\\n\\n\\n They went much closer to\\n Earth, not intending to commit\\n themselves. For a day they circled\\n the planet, avoiding radar\\n detection, which for them was\\n not difficult, testing, and sampling.\\n Finally Ethaniel looked up\\n from the monitor screen. \"Any\\n conclusions?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s there to think? It\\'s\\n worse than I imagined.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, we knew they had the\\n big bomb. Atmospheric analysis\\n showed that as far away as we\\n were.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We also knew they could deliver\\n the big bomb, presumably\\n by some sort of aircraft.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That was almost a certainty.\\n They\\'d have no use for the big\\n bomb without aircraft.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s worse is that I now\\n find they also have missiles,\\n range one thousand miles and\\n upward. They either have or are\\n near a primitive form of space\\n travel.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bad,\" said Ethaniel. \"Sitting\\n there, wondering when it\\'s going\\n to hit them. Nervousness could\\n set it off.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It could, and the missiles\\n make it worse,\" said Bal. \"What\\n did you find out at your end?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nothing worthwhile. I was\\n looking at the people while you\\n were investigating their weapons.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You must think something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish I knew what to think.\\n There\\'s so little time,\" Ethaniel\\n said. \"Language isn\\'t the difficulty.\\n Our machines translate\\n their languages easily and I\\'ve\\n taken a cram course in two or\\n three of them. But that\\'s not\\n enough, looking at a few plays,\\n listening to advertisements, music,\\n and news bulletins. I should\\n go down and live among them,\\n read books, talk to scholars, work\\n with them, play.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You could do that and you\\'d\\n really get to know them. But\\n that takes time—and we don\\'t\\n have it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I realize that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\\n\\n\\n \"No. We can\\'t help them,\" said\\n Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we\\n can do for them—but we have to\\n try.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, I knew it before we\\n started,\" said Bal. \"It\\'s happened\\n before. We take the trouble to\\n find out what a people are like\\n and when we can\\'t help them we\\n feel bad. It\\'s going to be that\\n way again.\" He rose and stretched.\\n \"Well, give me an hour to\\n think of some way of going at\\n it.\"\\nIt was longer than that before\\n they met again. In the meantime\\n the ship moved much closer to\\n Earth. They no longer needed instruments\\n to see it. The planet\\n revolved outside the visionports.\\n The southern plains were green,\\n coursed with rivers; the oceans\\n were blue; and much of the\\n northern hemisphere was glistening\\n white. Ragged clouds covered\\n the pole, and a dirty pall\\n spread over the mid-regions of\\n the north.\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t thought of anything\\n brilliant,\" said Ethaniel.\\n\\n\\n \"Nor I,\" said Bal. \"We\\'re going\\n to have to go down there\\n cold. And it will be cold.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. It\\'s their winter.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I did have an idea,\" said Bal.\\n \"What about going down as supernatural\\n beings?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hardly,\" said Ethaniel. \"A\\n hundred years ago it might have\\n worked. Today they have satellites.\\n They are not primitives.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose you\\'re right,\" said\\n Bal. \"I did think we ought to\\n take advantage of our physical\\n differences.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If we could I\\'d be all for it.\\n But these people are rough and\\n desperate. They wouldn\\'t be\\n fooled by anything that crude.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, you\\'re calling it,\" said\\n Bal.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" said Ethaniel.\\n \"You take one side and I the\\n other. We\\'ll tell them bluntly\\n what they\\'ll have to do if they\\'re\\n going to survive, how they can\\n keep their planet in one piece so\\n they can live on it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'ll go over big. Advice is\\n always popular.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t help it. That\\'s all we\\n have time for.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Special instructions?\"\\n\\n\\n \"None. We leave the ship here\\n and go down in separate landing\\n craft. You can talk with me any\\n time you want to through our\\n communications, but don\\'t unless\\n you have to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They can\\'t intercept the\\n beams we use.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They can\\'t, and even if they\\n did they wouldn\\'t know what to\\n do with our language. I want\\n them to think that we don\\'t\\nneed\\nto talk things over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I get it. Makes us seem better\\n than we are. They think we know\\n exactly what we\\'re doing even\\n though we don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If we\\'re lucky they\\'ll think\\n that.\"\\nBal looked out of the port at\\n the planet below. \"It\\'s going to\\n be cold where I\\'m going. You too.\\n Sure we don\\'t want to change\\n our plans and land in the southern\\n hemisphere? It\\'s summer\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m afraid not. The great\\n powers are in the north. They\\n are the ones we have to reach to\\n do the job.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I was thinking of\\n that holiday you mentioned.\\n We\\'ll be running straight into it.\\n That won\\'t help us any.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, they don\\'t like their\\n holidays interrupted. It can\\'t be\\n helped. We can\\'t wait until it\\'s\\n over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m aware of that,\" said Bal.\\n \"Fill me in on that holiday, anything\\n I ought to know. Probably\\n religious in origin. That so?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was religious a long time\\n ago,\" said Ethaniel. \"I didn\\'t\\n learn anything exact from radio\\n and TV. Now it seems to be\\n chiefly a time for eating, office\\n parties, and selling merchandise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see. It has become a business\\n holiday.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s a good description. I\\n didn\\'t get as much of it as I\\n ought to have. I was busy studying\\n the people, and they\\'re hard\\n to pin down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see. I was thinking there\\n might be some way we could tie\\n ourselves in with this holiday.\\n Make it work for us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If there is I haven\\'t thought\\n of it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You ought to know. You\\'re\\n running this one.\" Bal looked\\n down at the planet. Clouds were\\n beginning to form at the twilight\\n edge. \"I hate to go down\\n and leave the ship up here with\\n no one in it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They can\\'t touch it. No matter\\n how they develop in the next\\n hundred years they still won\\'t be\\n able to get in or damage it in\\n any way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s myself I\\'m thinking\\n about. Down there, alone.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll be with you. On the other\\n side of the Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not very close. I\\'d like\\n it better if there were someone\\n in the ship to bring it down in a\\n hurry if things get rough. They\\n don\\'t think much of each other.\\n I don\\'t imagine they\\'ll like aliens\\n any better.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They may be unfriendly,\"\\n Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he\\n switched a monitor screen until\\n he looked at the slope of a mountain.\\n It was snowing and men\\n were cutting small green trees in\\n the snow. \"I\\'ve thought of a\\n trick.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If it saves my neck I\\'m for\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t guarantee anything,\"\\n said Ethaniel. \"This is what I\\n was thinking of: instead of hiding\\n the ship against the sun\\n where there\\'s little chance it will\\n be seen, we\\'ll make sure that\\n they do see it. Let\\'s take it\\n around to the night side of the\\n planet and light it up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Say, pretty good,\" said Bal.\\n\\n\\n \"They can\\'t imagine that we\\'d\\n light up an unmanned ship,\" said\\n Ethaniel. \"Even if the thought\\n should occur to them they\\'ll have\\n no way of checking it. Also, they\\n won\\'t be eager to harm us with\\n our ship shining down on them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s thinking,\" said Bal,\\n moving to the controls. \"I\\'ll move\\n the ship over where they can see\\n it best and then I\\'ll light it up.\\n I\\'ll really light it up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t spare power.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t worry about that.\\n They\\'ll see it. Everybody on\\n Earth will see it.\" Later, with the\\n ship in position, glowing against\\n the darkness of space, pulsating\\n with light, Bal said: \"You know,\\n I feel better about this. We may\\n pull it off. Lighting the ship may\\n be just the help we need.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not we who need help, but\\n the people of Earth,\" said Ethaniel.\\n \"See you in five days.\" With\\n that he entered a small landing\\n craft, which left a faintly luminescent\\n trail as it plunged toward\\n Earth. As soon as it was\\n safe to do so, Bal left in another\\n craft, heading for the other side\\n of the planet.\\nAnd the spaceship circled\\n Earth, unmanned, blazing and\\n pulsing with light. No star in the\\n winter skies of the planet below\\n could equal it in brilliancy. Once\\n a man-made satellite came near\\n but it was dim and was lost sight\\n of by the people below. During\\n the day the ship was visible as\\n a bright spot of light. At evening\\n it seemed to burn through\\n the sunset colors.\\n\\n\\n And the ship circled on,\\n bright, shining, seeming to be a\\n little piece clipped from the center\\n of a star and brought near\\n Earth to illuminate it. Never, or\\n seldom, had Earth seen anything\\n like it.\\n\\n\\n In five days the two small landing\\n craft that had left it arched\\n up from Earth and joined the\\n orbit of the large ship. The two\\n small craft slid inside the large\\n one and doors closed behind\\n them. In a short time the aliens\\n met again.\\n\\n\\n \"We did it,\" said Bal exultantly\\n as he came in. \"I don\\'t know\\n how we did it and I thought we\\n were going to fail but at the last\\n minute they came through.\"\\n\\n\\n Ethaniel smiled. \"I\\'m tired,\"\\n he said, rustling.\\n\\n\\n \"Me too, but mostly I\\'m cold,\"\\n said Bal, shivering. \"Snow.\\n Nothing but snow wherever I\\n went. Miserable climate. And yet\\n you had me go out walking after\\n that first day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"From my own experience it\\n seemed to be a good idea,\" said\\n Ethaniel. \"If I went out walking\\n one day I noticed that the next\\n day the officials were much more\\n cooperative. If it worked for me\\n I thought it might help you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It did. I don\\'t know why, but\\n it did,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, this\\n agreement they made isn\\'t the\\n best but I think it will keep them\\n from destroying themselves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s as much as we can expect,\"\\n said Ethaniel. \"They may\\n have small wars after this, but\\n never the big one. In fifty or a\\n hundred years we can come back\\n and see how much they\\'ve\\n learned.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not sure I want to,\" said\\n Bal. \"Say, what\\'s an angel?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"When I went out walking\\n people stopped to look. Some\\n knelt in the snow and called me\\n an angel.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Something like that happened\\n to me,\" said Ethaniel.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t get it but I didn\\'t let\\n it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled\\n at them and went about my business.\"\\n He shivered again. \"It was\\n always cold. I walked out, but\\n sometimes I flew back. I hope\\n that was all right.\"\\n\\n\\n In the cabin Bal spread his\\n great wings. Renaissance painters\\n had never seen his like but\\n knew exactly how he looked. In\\n their paintings they had pictured\\n him innumerable times.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think it hurt us that\\n you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did\\n so myself occasionally.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you don\\'t know what an\\n angel is?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. I didn\\'t have time to find\\n out. Some creature of their folklore\\n I suppose. You know, except\\n for our wings they\\'re very much\\n like ourselves. Their legends are\\n bound to resemble ours.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway,\\n peace on Earth.\"\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\\nJanuary\\n 1960.

And all they got\\n for their patience was the\\n biggest surprise since David\\n clobbered Goliath.\\n\"\\n Let\\n me put it this way,\"\\n Conners said paternally.\\n \"We expect a certain amount of\\n decorum from our Washington\\n news correspondents, and that\\'s\\n all I\\'m asking for.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the\\n chair opposite his employer\\'s\\n desk, chewed on his knuckles\\n and said nothing. One part of\\n his mind wanted him to play it\\n cagey, to behave the way the\\n newspaper wanted him to behave,\\n to protect the cozy Washington\\n assignment he had waited\\n four years to get. But another\\n part of him, a rebel part,\\n wanted him to stay on the trail\\n of the story he felt sure was\\n about to break.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t mean to make trouble,\\n Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.\\n \"It just seemed strange, all\\n these exchanges of couriers in\\n the past two days. I couldn\\'t\\n help thinking something was\\n up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Even if that\\'s true, we\\'ll\\n hear about it through the usual\\n channels,\" Conners frowned.\\n \"But getting a senator\\'s secretary\\n drunk to obtain information—well,\\n that\\'s not only indiscreet,\\n Bridges. It\\'s downright\\n dirty.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn\\'t take\\nthat\\nkind of advantage, Mr.\\n Conners. Not that she wasn\\'t a\\n toothsome little dish ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just thank your lucky stars\\n that it didn\\'t go any further.\\n And from now on—\" He waggled\\n a finger at him. \"Watch\\n your step.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry got up and ambled to the\\n door. But he turned before leaving\\n and said:\\n\\n\\n \"By the way. What do\\nyou\\nthink is going on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t the faintest idea.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t kid me, Mr. Conners.\\n Think it\\'s war?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'ll be all, Bridges.\"\\nThe reporter closed the door\\n behind him, and then strolled\\n out of the building into the sunlight.\\n\\n\\n He met Ruskin, the fat little\\n AP correspondent, in front of\\n the Pan-American Building on\\n Constitution Avenue. Ruskin\\n was holding the newspaper that\\n contained the gossip-column\\n item which had started the\\n whole affair, and he seemed\\n more interested in the romantic\\n rather than political implications.\\n As he walked beside him,\\n he said:\\n\\n\\n \"So what really happened,\\n pal? That Greta babe really let\\n down her hair?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s your decorum?\"\\n Jerry growled.\\n\\n\\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she\\'s\\n quite a dame, all right. I think\\n they ought to get the Secret\\n Service to guard her. She really\\n fills out a size 10, don\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you\\n have a low mind. For a week,\\n this town has been acting like\\n the\\n39 Steps\\n, and all you can\\n think about is dames. What\\'s\\n the matter with you? Where\\n will you be when the big mushroom\\n cloud comes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin\\n sighed. \"What a way to get\\n radioactive.\"\\n\\n\\n They split off a few blocks\\n later, and Jerry walked until he\\n came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;\\n Grill, a favorite hangout of the\\n local journalists. There were\\n three other newsmen at the bar,\\n and they gave him snickering\\n greetings. He took a small table\\n in the rear and ate his meal in\\n sullen silence.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t the newsmen\\'s jibes\\n that bothered him; it was the\\n certainty that something of\\n major importance was happening\\n in the capitol. There had\\n been hourly conferences at the\\n White House, flying visits by\\n State Department officials, mysterious\\n conferences involving\\n members of the Science Commission.\\n So far, the byword\\n had been secrecy. They knew\\n that Senator Spocker, chairman\\n of the Congressional Science\\n Committee, had been involved\\n in every meeting, but Senator\\n Spocker was unavailable. His\\n secretary, however, was a little\\n more obliging ...\\n\\n\\n Jerry looked up from his\\n coffee and blinked when he saw\\n who was coming through the\\n door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did\\n every other patron, but for different\\n reasons. Greta Johnson\\n had that effect upon men. Even\\n the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored\\n suit didn\\'t hide\\n her outrageously feminine qualities.\\n\\n\\n She walked straight to his\\n table, and he stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"They told me you might be\\n here,\" she said, breathing hard.\\n \"I just wanted to thank you for\\n last night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Greta—\"\\nWham!\\nHer hand, small and\\n delicate, felt like a slab of lead\\n when it slammed into his cheek.\\n She left a bruise five fingers\\n wide, and then turned and stalked\\n out.\\nHe ran after her, the restaurant\\n proprietor shouting about\\n the unpaid bill. It took a rapid\\n dog-trot to reach her side.\\n\\n\\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.\\n \"You don\\'t understand about\\n last night. It wasn\\'t the way\\n that lousy columnist said—\"\\n\\n\\n She stopped in her tracks.\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t have minded so\\n much if you\\'d gotten me drunk.\\n But to\\nuse\\nme, just to get a\\n story—\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I\\'m a\\nreporter\\n, damn it.\\n It\\'s my job. I\\'d do it again if\\n I thought you knew anything.\"\\n\\n\\n She was pouting now. \"Well,\\n how do you suppose I feel,\\n knowing you\\'re only interested\\n in me because of the Senator?\\n Anyway, I\\'ll probably lose my\\n job, and then you won\\'t have\\nany\\nuse for me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said\\n sadly.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you\\n won\\'t want to see me any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did I say that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It just won\\'t be any use.\\n We\\'ll always have this thing between\\n us.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him for a moment,\\n and then touched his\\n bruised cheek with a tender,\\n motherly gesture.\\n\\n\\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,\\n and then sighed. \"Oh,\\n well. I guess there\\'s no use\\n fighting it. Maybe if I\\ndid\\ntell\\n you what I know, we could act\\nhuman\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Greta!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But if you print one\\nword\\nof it, Jerry Bridges, I\\'ll never\\n speak to you again!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking\\n her arm, \"you can trust me like\\n a brother.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s\\nnot\\nthe idea,\" Greta\\n said stiffly.\\n\\n\\n In a secluded booth at the rear\\n of a restaurant unfrequented by\\n newsmen, Greta leaned forward\\n and said:\\n\\n\\n \"At first, they thought it was\\n another sputnik.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWho\\ndid?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The State Department, silly.\\n They got reports from the observatories\\n about another sputnik\\n being launched by the Russians.\\n Only the Russians denied\\n it. Then there were joint meetings,\\n and nobody could figure\\n out\\nwhat\\nthe damn thing was.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said\\n dizzily. \"You mean to tell me\\n there\\'s another of those metal\\n moons up there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s not a moon. That\\'s\\n the big point. It\\'s a spaceship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A\\nwhat\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said\\n coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They\\n have been in contact with it now\\n for about three days, and they\\'re\\n thinking of calling a plenary\\n session of the UN just to figure\\n out what to do about it. The\\n only hitch is, Russia doesn\\'t\\n want to wait that long, and is\\n asking for a hurry-up summit\\n meeting to make a decision.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A decision about what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"About the Venusians, of\\n course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I\\n think you\\'re still a little woozy\\n from last night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be silly. The spaceship\\'s\\n from Venus; they\\'ve already\\n established that. And the\\n people on it—I\\nguess\\nthey\\'re\\n people—want to know if they\\n can land their delegate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Their what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Their delegate. They came\\n here for some kind of conference,\\n I guess. They know about\\n the UN and everything, and\\n they want to take part. They\\n say that with all the satellites\\n being launched, that our affairs\\n are\\ntheir\\naffairs, too. It\\'s kind\\n of confusing, but that\\'s what\\n they say.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean these Venusians\\n speak English?\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Russian. And French.\\n And German. And everything I\\n guess. They\\'ve been having\\n radio talks with practically\\n every country for the past three\\n days. Like I say, they want to\\n establish diplomatic relations\\n or something. The Senator\\n thinks that if we don\\'t agree,\\n they might do something drastic,\\n like blow us all up. It\\'s kind\\n of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re taking it mighty\\n calm,\" he said ironically.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, how else can I take it?\\n I\\'m not even supposed to\\nknow\\nabout it, except that the Senator\\n is so careless about—\" She\\n put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,\\n dear, now you\\'ll really think I\\'m\\n terrible.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Terrible? I think you\\'re\\n wonderful!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you promise not to print\\n it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t I say I wouldn\\'t?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you\\'re\\n a liar sometimes, Jerry. I\\'ve noticed\\n that about you.\"\\nThe press secretary\\'s secretary,\\n a massive woman with\\n gray hair and impervious to\\n charm, guarded the portals of\\n his office with all the indomitable\\n will of the U. S. Marines.\\n But Jerry Bridges tried.\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t understand, Lana,\"\\n he said. \"I don\\'t want to\\nsee\\nMr.\\n Howells. I just want you to\\ngive\\nhim something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My name\\'s not Lana, and I\\ncan\\'t\\ndeliver any messages.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But this is something he\\nwants\\nto see.\" He handed her\\n an envelope, stamped URGENT.\\n \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I\\'ll\\n buy you the flashiest pair of\\n diamond earrings in Washington.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the woman said,\\n thawing slightly. \"I\\ncould\\ndeliver\\n it with his next batch of mail.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When will that be?\"\\n\\n\\n \"In an hour. He\\'s in a terribly\\n important meeting right\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got some mail right\\n there. Earrings and a bracelet\\n to match.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him with exasperation,\\n and then gathered up\\n a stack of memorandums and\\n letters, his own envelope atop\\n it. She came out of the press\\n secretary\\'s office two minutes\\n later with Howells himself, and\\n Howells said: \"You there,\\n Bridges. Come in here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\\nsir\\n!\" Jerry said, breezing\\n by the waiting reporters\\n with a grin of triumph.\\n\\n\\n There were six men in the\\n room, three in military uniform.\\n Howells poked the envelope towards\\n Jerry, and snapped:\\n\\n\\n \"This note of yours. Just what\\n do you think it means?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know better than I do,\\n Mr. Howells. I\\'m just doing my\\n job; I think the public has a\\n right to know about this spaceship\\n that\\'s flying around—\"\\nHis words brought an exclamation\\n from the others. Howells\\n sighed, and said:\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don\\'t make\\n it easy for us. It\\'s our opinion\\n that secrecy is essential, that\\n leakage of the story might cause\\n panic. Since you\\'re the only unauthorized\\n person who knows of\\n it, we have two choices. One of\\n them is to lock you up.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry swallowed hard.\\n\\n\\n \"The other is perhaps more\\n practical,\" Howells said. \"You\\'ll\\n be taken into our confidence, and\\n allowed to accompany those officials\\n who will be admitted to the\\n landing site. But you will\\nnot\\nbe\\n allowed to relay the story to the\\n press until such a time as\\nall\\ncorrespondents are informed.\\n That won\\'t give you a \\'scoop\\' if\\n that\\'s what you call it, but you\\'ll\\n be an eyewitness. That should\\n be worth something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s worth a lot,\" Jerry said\\n eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t thank me, I\\'m not doing\\n you any\\npersonal\\nfavor. Now\\n about the landing tonight—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean the spaceship\\'s\\n coming down?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers\\n conference was held this\\n morning, and a decision was\\n reached to accept the delegate.\\n Landing instructions are being\\n given at Los Alamos, and the\\n ship will presumably land\\n around midnight tonight. There\\n will be a jet leaving Washington\\n Airport at nine, and you\\'ll be\\n on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself\\n in custody.\"\\nThe USAF jet transport\\n wasn\\'t the only secrecy-shrouded\\n aircraft that took off that evening\\n from Washington Airport.\\n But Jerry Bridges, sitting in\\n the rear seat flanked by two\\n Sphinx-like Secret Service men,\\n knew that he was the only passenger\\n with non-official status\\n aboard.\\n\\n\\n It was only a few minutes\\n past ten when they arrived at\\n the air base at Los Alamos. The\\n desert sky was cloudy and starless,\\n and powerful searchlights\\n probed the thick cumulus. There\\n were sleek, purring black autos\\n waiting to rush the air passengers\\n to some unnamed destination.\\n They drove for twenty\\n minutes across a flat ribbon of\\n desert road, until Jerry sighted\\n what appeared to be a circle of\\n newly-erected lights in the middle\\n of nowhere. On the perimeter,\\n official vehicles were parked\\n in orderly rows, and four USAF\\n trailer trucks were in evidence,\\n their radarscopes turning slowly.\\n There was activity everywhere,\\n but it was well-ordered\\n and unhurried. They had done a\\n good job of keeping the excitement\\n contained.\\n\\n\\n He was allowed to leave the\\n car and stroll unescorted. He\\n tried to talk to some of the\\n scurrying officials, but to no\\n avail. Finally, he contented\\n himself by sitting on the sand,\\n his back against the grill of a\\n staff car, smoking one cigarette\\n after another.\\n\\n\\n As the minutes ticked off, the\\n activity became more frenetic\\n around him. Then the pace slowed,\\n and he knew the appointed\\n moment was approaching. Stillness\\n returned to the desert, and\\n tension was a tangible substance\\n in the night air.\\n\\n\\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\\n\\n\\n The searchlights converged\\n in an intricate pattern.\\n\\n\\n Then the clouds seemed to\\n part!\\n\\n\\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice\\n shouted. And in a moment, the\\n calm was shattered. At first, he\\n saw nothing. A faint roar was\\n started in the heavens, and it\\n became a growl that increased\\n in volume until even the shouting\\n voices could no longer be\\n heard. Then the crisscrossing\\n lights struck metal, glancing off\\n the gleaming body of a descending\\n object. Larger and larger\\n the object grew, until it assumed\\n the definable shape of a squat\\n silver funnel, falling in a perfect\\n straight line towards the center\\n of the light-ringed area. When it\\n hit, a dust cloud obscured it from\\n sight.\\nA loudspeaker blared out an\\n unintelligible order, but its message\\n was clear. No one moved\\n from their position.\\n\\n\\n Finally, a three-man team,\\n asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped\\n out from the ring of spectators.\\n They carried geiger counters\\n on long poles before them.\\n\\n\\n Jerry held his breath as they\\n approached the object; only\\n when they were yards away did\\n he appreciate its size. It wasn\\'t\\n large; not more than fifteen feet\\n in total circumference.\\n\\n\\n One of the three men waved\\n a gloved hand.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s okay,\" a voice breathed\\n behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\\n\\n\\n Slowly, the ring of spectators\\n closed tighter. They were twenty\\n yards from the ship when the\\n voice spoke to them.\\n\\n\\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it\\n said, and then repeated the\\n phrase in six languages. \"The\\n ship you see is a Venusian Class\\n 7 interplanetary rocket, built\\n for one-passenger. It is clear of\\n all radiation, and is perfectly\\n safe to approach. There is a\\n hatch which may be opened by\\n an automatic lever in the side.\\n Please open this hatch and remove\\n the passenger.\"\\n\\n\\n An Air Force General whom\\n Jerry couldn\\'t identify stepped\\n forward. He circled the ship\\n warily, and then said something\\n to the others. They came closer,\\n and he touched a small lever on\\n the silvery surface of the funnel.\\n\\n\\n A door slid open.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a box!\" someone said.\\n\\n\\n \"A crate—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!\\n Lend a hand here—\"\\n\\n\\n A trio came forward and\\n hoisted the crate out of the ship.\\n Then the voice spoke again;\\n Jerry deduced that it must have\\n been activated by the decreased\\n load of the ship.\\n\\n\\n \"Please open the crate. You\\n will find our delegate within.\\n We trust you will treat him\\n with the courtesy of an official\\n emissary.\"\\n\\n\\n They set to work on the crate,\\n its gray plastic material giving\\n in readily to the application of\\n their tools. But when it was\\n opened, they stood aside in\\n amazement and consternation.\\n\\n\\n There were a variety of metal\\n pieces packed within, protected\\n by a filmy packing material.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general\\n said. \"Here\\'s a book—\"\\n\\n\\n He picked up a gray-bound\\n volume, and opened its cover.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Instructions for assembling\\n Delegate,\\'\" he read aloud.\\n \"\\'First, remove all parts and\\n arrange them in the following\\n order. A-1, central nervous system\\n housing. A-2 ...\\'\" He looked\\n up. \"It\\'s an instruction book,\"\\n he whispered. \"We\\'re supposed\\n to\\nbuild\\nthe damn thing.\"\\nThe Delegate, a handsomely\\n constructed robot almost eight\\n feet tall, was pieced together\\n some three hours later, by a\\n team of scientists and engineers\\n who seemed to find the Venusian\\n instructions as elementary as a\\n blueprint in an Erector set. But\\n simple as the job was, they were\\n obviously impressed by the\\n mechanism they had assembled.\\n It stood impassive until they\\n obeyed the final instruction.\\n \"Press Button K ...\"\\n\\n\\n They found button K, and\\n pressed it.\\n\\n\\n The robot bowed.\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it\\n said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.\\n \"Now if you will please\\n escort me to the meeting\\n place ...\"\\nIt wasn\\'t until three days\\n after the landing that Jerry\\n Bridges saw the Delegate again.\\n Along with a dozen assorted\\n government officials, Army officers,\\n and scientists, he was\\n quartered in a quonset hut in\\n Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,\\n after seventy-two frustrating\\n hours, he was escorted by Marine\\n guard into New York City.\\n No one told him his destination,\\n and it wasn\\'t until he saw the\\n bright strips of light across the\\n face of the United Nations\\n building that he knew where the\\n meeting was to be held.\\n\\n\\n But his greatest surprise was\\n yet to come. The vast auditorium\\n which housed the general\\n assembly was filled to its capacity,\\n but there were new faces\\n behind the plaques which designated\\n the member nations.\\n He couldn\\'t believe his eyes at\\n first, but as the meeting got\\n under way, he knew that it was\\n true. The highest echelons of the\\n world\\'s governments were represented,\\n even—Jerry gulped\\n at the realization—Nikita Khrushchev\\n himself. It was a summit\\n meeting such as he had never\\n dreamed possible, a summit\\n meeting without benefit of long\\n foreign minister\\'s debate. And\\n the cause of it all, a placid,\\n highly-polished metal robot, was\\n seated blithely at a desk which\\n bore the designation:\\nVENUS.\\n\\n\\n The robot delegate stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the\\n microphone, and the great men\\n at the council tables strained to\\n hear the translator\\'s version\\n through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,\\n I thank you for your\\n prompt attention. I come as a\\n Delegate from a great neighbor\\n planet, in the interests of peace\\n and progress for all the solar\\n system. I come in the belief that\\n peace is the responsibility of individuals,\\n of nations, and now\\n of worlds, and that each is dependent\\n upon the other. I speak\\n to you now through the electronic\\n instrumentation which\\n has been created for me, and I\\n come to offer your planet not\\n merely a threat, a promise, or\\n an easy solution—but a challenge.\"\\n\\n\\n The council room stirred.\\n\\n\\n \"Your earth satellites have\\n been viewed with interest by the\\n astronomers of our world, and\\n we foresee the day when contact\\n between our planets will be commonplace.\\n As for ourselves, we\\n have hitherto had little desire\\n to explore beyond our realm,\\n being far too occupied with internal\\n matters. But our isolation\\n cannot last in the face of\\n your progress, so we believe that\\n we must take part in your\\n affairs.\\n\\n\\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.\\n Continue your struggle of ideas,\\n compete with each other for the\\n minds of men, fight your bloodless\\n battles, if you know no\\n other means to attain progress.\\n But do all this\\nwithout\\nunleashing\\n the terrible forces of power\\n now at your command. Once\\n unleashed, these forces may or\\n may not destroy all that you\\n have gained. But we, the scientists\\n of Venus, promise you this—that\\n on the very day your conflict\\n deteriorates into heedless\\n violence, we will not stand by\\n and let the ugly contagion\\n spread. On that day, we of\\n Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,\\n and relentlessly—to destroy\\n your world completely.\"\\n\\n\\n Again, the meeting room exploded\\n in a babble of languages.\\n\\n\\n \"The vessel which brought me\\n here came as a messenger of\\n peace. But envision it, men of\\n Earth, as a messenger of war.\\n Unstoppable, inexorable, it may\\n return, bearing a different Delegate\\n from Venus—a Delegate of\\n Death, who speaks not in words,\\n but in the explosion of atoms.\\n Think of thousands of such Delegates,\\n fired from a vantage\\n point far beyond the reach of\\n your retaliation. This is the\\n promise and the challenge that\\n will hang in your night sky from\\n this moment forward. Look at\\n the planet Venus, men of Earth,\\n and see a Goddess of Vengeance,\\n poised to wreak its wrath upon\\n those who betray the peace.\"\\n\\n\\n The Delegate sat down.\\nFour days later, a mysterious\\n explosion rocked the quiet sands\\n of Los Alamos, and the Venus\\n spacecraft was no more. Two\\n hours after that, the robot delegate,\\n its message delivered, its\\n mission fulfilled, requested to be\\n locked inside a bombproof\\n chamber. When the door was\\n opened, the Delegate was an exploded\\n ruin.\\n\\n\\n The news flashed with lightning\\n speed over the world, and\\n Jerry Bridges\\' eyewitness accounts\\n of the incredible event\\n was syndicated throughout the\\n nation. But his sudden celebrity\\n left him vaguely unsatisfied.\\n\\n\\n He tried to explain his feeling\\n to Greta on his first night back\\n in Washington. They were in his\\n apartment, and it was the first\\n time Greta had consented to pay\\n him the visit.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what\\'s\\nbothering\\nyou?\"\\n Greta pouted. \"You\\'ve had the\\n biggest story of the year under\\n your byline. I should think you\\'d\\n be tickled pink.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not that,\" Jerry said\\n moodily. \"But ever since I heard\\n the Delegate speak, something\\'s\\n been nagging me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But don\\'t you think he\\'s done\\n good? Don\\'t you think they\\'ll be\\n impressed by what he said?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not worried about that.\\n I think that damn robot did\\n more for peace than anything\\n that\\'s ever come along in this\\n cockeyed world. But still ...\"\\n\\n\\n Greta snuggled up to him on\\n the sofa. \"You worry too much.\\n Don\\'t you ever think of anything\\n else? You should learn to\\n relax. It can be fun.\"\\n\\n\\n She started to prove it to him,\\n and Jerry responded the way a\\n normal, healthy male usually\\n does. But in the middle of an\\n embrace, he cried out:\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I just thought of something!\\n Now where the hell did I put\\n my old notebooks?\"\\n\\n\\n He got up from the sofa and\\n went scurrying to a closet. From\\n a debris of cardboard boxes, he\\n found a worn old leather brief\\n case, and cackled with delight\\n when he found the yellowed\\n notebooks inside.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\nare\\nthey?\" Greta said.\\n\\n\\n \"My old school notebooks.\\n Greta, you\\'ll have to excuse me.\\n But there\\'s something I\\'ve got\\n to do, right away!\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s all right with me,\"\\n Greta said haughtily. \"I know\\n when I\\'m not wanted.\"\\n\\n\\n She took her hat and coat from\\n the hall closet, gave him one\\n last chance to change his mind,\\n and then left.\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, Jerry\\n Bridges was calling the airlines.\\nIt had been eleven years since\\n Jerry had walked across the\\n campus of Clifton University,\\n heading for the ivy-choked\\n main building. It was remarkable\\n how little had changed, but\\n the students seemed incredibly\\n young. He was winded by the\\n time he asked the pretty girl at\\n the desk where Professor Martin\\n Coltz could be located.\\n\\n\\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck\\n a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I\\n guess he\\'d be in the Holland\\n Laboratory about now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Holland Laboratory? What\\'s\\n that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I guess that was after\\n your time, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed\\n to say: \"It must be something\\n new since I was here.\\n Where is this place?\"\\n\\n\\n He followed her directions,\\n and located a fresh-painted\\n building three hundred yards\\n from the men\\'s dorm. He met a\\n student at the door, who told\\n him that Professor Coltz would\\n be found in the physics department.\\n\\n\\n The room was empty when\\n Jerry entered, except for the\\n single stooped figure vigorously\\n erasing a blackboard. He turned\\n when the door opened. If the\\n students looked younger, Professor\\n Coltz was far older than\\n Jerry remembered. He was a\\n tall man, with an unruly confusion\\n of straight gray hair. He\\n blinked when Jerry said:\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember\\n me? Jerry Bridges?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course! I thought of you\\n only yesterday, when I saw your\\n name in the papers—\"\\n\\n\\n They sat at facing student\\n desks, and chatted about old\\n times. But Jerry was impatient\\n to get to the point of his visit,\\n and he blurted out:\\n\\n\\n \"Professor Coltz, something\\'s\\n been bothering me. It bothered\\n me from the moment I heard\\n the Delegate speak. I didn\\'t\\n know what it was until last\\n night, when I dug out my old\\n college notebooks. Thank God\\n I kept them.\"\\n\\n\\n Coltz\\'s eyes were suddenly\\n hooded.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There was something about\\n the Robot\\'s speech that sounded\\n familiar—I could have sworn\\n I\\'d heard some of the words\\n before. I couldn\\'t prove anything\\n until I checked my old\\n notes, and here\\'s what I found.\"\\n\\n\\n He dug into his coat pocket\\n and produced a sheet of paper.\\n He unfolded it and read aloud.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'It\\'s my belief that peace is\\n the responsibility of individuals,\\n of nations, and someday, even of\\n worlds ...\\' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\\n\\n\\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.\\n \"I don\\'t recall every silly thing\\n I said, Jerry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s an interesting coincidence,\\n isn\\'t it, Professor?\\n These very words were spoken\\n by the Delegate from Venus.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A coincidence—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is it? But I also remember\\n your interest in robotics. I\\'ll\\n never forget that mechanical\\n homing pigeon you constructed.\\n And you\\'ve probably learned\\n much more these past eleven\\n years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you driving at,\\n Jerry?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a\\n little daydream, recently, and I\\n want you to hear it. I dreamed\\n about a group of teachers, scientists,\\n and engineers, a group\\n who were suddenly struck by\\n an exciting, incredible idea. A\\n group that worked in the quiet\\n and secrecy of a University on a\\n fantastic scheme to force the\\n idea of peace into the minds of\\n the world\\'s big shots. Does my\\n dream interest you, Professor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I dreamt that this\\n group would secretly launch an\\n earth satellite of their own, and\\n arrange for the nose cone to\\n come down safely at a certain\\n time and place. They would install\\n a marvelous electronic robot\\n within the cone, ready to be\\n assembled. They would beam a\\n radio message to earth from the\\n cone, seemingly as if it originated\\n from their \\'spaceship.\\'\\n Then, when the Robot was assembled,\\n they would speak\\n through it to demand peace for\\n all mankind ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jerry, if you do this—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t have to say it,\\n Professor, I know what you\\'re\\n thinking. I\\'m a reporter, and my\\n business is to tell the world\\n everything I know. But if I\\n did it, there might not be a\\n world for me to write about,\\n would there? No, thanks, Professor.\\n As far as I\\'m concerned,\\n what I told you was nothing\\n more than a daydream.\"\\nJerry braked the convertible\\n to a halt, and put his arm\\n around Greta\\'s shoulder. She\\n looked up at the star-filled night,\\n and sighed romantically.\\n\\n\\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\\n\\n\\n Greta shivered closer to him.\\n\\n\\n \"And to think what that terrible\\n planet can do to us!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also\\n the Goddess of Love.\"\\n\\n\\n He swung his other arm\\n around her, and Venus winked\\n approvingly.\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\\nOctober 1958.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

Merritt, he attempted\\n to imitate in style, mood\\n and subject the magic of that\\n late lamented master of fantasy.\\n The imitation found great favor\\n from the readership and almost\\n instantly Jack Williamson became\\n an important name on the\\n contents page of\\nAMAZING STORIES\\n .\\nHe followed his initial success\\n with two short novels\\n, The\\n Green Girl\\nin\\nAMAZING STORIES\\nand\\nThe Alien Intelligence\\nin\\nSCIENCE WONDER STORIES\\n ,\\nanother\\n Gernsback publication. Both of\\n these stories were close copies of\\n A. Merritt, whose style and method\\n Jack Williamson parlayed into\\n popularity for eight years.\\nYet the strange thing about it\\n was that Jack Williamson was\\n one of the most versatile science\\n fiction authors ever to sit down\\n at the typewriter. When the\\n vogue for science-fantasy altered\\n to super science, he created the\\n memorable super lock-picker\\n Giles Habilula as the major attraction\\n in a rousing trio of space\\n operas\\n, The Legion of Space, The\\n Cometeers\\nand\\nOne Against the\\n Legion.\\nWhen grim realism was\\n the order of the day, he produced\\nCrucible of Power\\nand when they\\n wanted extrapolated theory in\\n present tense, he assumed the\\n disguise of Will Stewart and\\n popularized the concept of contra\\n terrene matter in science fiction\\n with\\nSeetee Ship\\nand\\nSeetee\\n Shock.\\nFinally, when only psychological\\n studies of the future\\n would do, he produced\\n\"With\\n Folded Hands ...\" \"... And\\n Searching Mind.\"\\n\\n\\n The Cosmic Express\\nis of special\\n interest because it was written\\n during Williamson\\'s A. Merritt\\n \"kick,\" when he was writing\\n little else but, and it gave the\\n earliest indication of a more general\\n capability. The lightness of\\n the handling is especially modern,\\n barely avoiding the farcical\\n by the validity of the notion that\\n wireless transmission of matter\\n is the next big transportation\\n frontier to be conquered. It is\\n especially important because it\\n stylistically forecast a later trend\\n to accept the background for\\n granted, regardless of the quantity\\n of wonders, and proceed with\\n the story. With only a few thousand\\n scanning-disk television sets\\n in existence at the time of the\\n writing, the surmise that this\\n media would be a natural for\\n westerns was particularly astute.\\nJack Williamson was born in\\n 1908 in the Arizona territory\\n when covered wagons were the\\n primary form of transportation\\n and apaches still raided the settlers.\\n His father was a cattle\\n man, but for young Jack, the\\n ranch was anything but glamorous.\\n \"My days were filled,\" he remembers,\\n \"with monotonous\\n rounds of what seemed an endless,\\n heart-breaking war with\\n drought and frost and dust-storms,\\n poison-weeds and hail,\\n for the sake of survival on the\\nLlano Estacado.\"\\nThe discovery\\n of\\nAMAZING STORIES\\nwas the escape\\n he sought and his goal was\\n to be a science fiction writer. He\\n labored to this end and the first\\n he knew that a story of his had\\n been accepted was when he\\n bought the December, 1929 issue\\n of\\nAMAZING STORIES\\n .\\nSince then,\\n he has written millions of words\\n of science fiction and has gone on\\n record as follows: \"I feel that\\n science-fiction is the folklore of\\n the new world of science, and\\n the expression of man\\'s reaction\\n to a technological environment.\\n By which I mean that it is the\\n most interesting and stimulating\\n form of literature today.\"\\nMr. Eric Stokes-Harding\\n tumbled out of the\\n rumpled bed-clothing, a striking\\n slender figure in purple-striped\\n pajamas. He smiled fondly across\\n to the other of the twin beds,\\n where Nada, his pretty bride,\\n lay quiet beneath light silk covers.\\n With a groan, he stood up\\n and began a series of fantastic\\n bending exercises. But after a\\n few half-hearted movements, he\\n gave it up, and walked through\\n an open door into a small bright\\n room, its walls covered with bookcases\\n and also with scientific appliances\\n that would have been\\n strange to the man of four or\\n five centuries before, when the\\n Age of Aviation was beginning.\\nSuddenly there was a sharp tingling\\n sensation where they touched\\n the polished surface.\\nYawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\\n stood before the great\\n open window, staring out. Below\\n him was a wide, park-like space,\\n green with emerald lawns, and\\n bright with flowering plants.\\n Two hundred yards across it rose\\n an immense pyramidal building—an\\n artistic structure, gleaming\\n with white marble and bright\\n metal, striped with the verdure\\n of terraced roof-gardens,\\n its slender peak rising to\\n help support the gray, steel-ribbed\\n glass roof above. Beyond,\\n the park stretched away in\\n illimitable vistas, broken with\\n the graceful columned buildings\\n that held up the great glass roof.\\n\\n\\n Above the glass, over this New\\n York of 2432 A. D., a freezing\\n blizzard was sweeping. But small\\n concern was that to the lightly\\n clad man at the window, who was\\n inhaling deeply the fragrant air\\n from the plants below—air kept,\\n winter and summer, exactly at\\n 20° C.\\n\\n\\n With another yawn, Mr. Eric\\n Stokes-Harding turned back to\\n the room, which was bright with\\n the rich golden light that poured\\n in from the suspended globes of\\n the cold ato-light that illuminated\\n the snow-covered city.\\n With a distasteful grimace, he\\n seated himself before a broad,\\n paper-littered desk, sat a few\\n minutes leaning back, with his\\n hands clasped behind his head.\\n At last he straightened reluctantly,\\n slid a small typewriter\\n out of its drawer, and began\\n pecking at it impatiently.\\n\\n\\n For Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\\n was an author. There was a whole\\n shelf of his books on the wall, in\\n bright jackets, red and blue and\\n green, that brought a thrill of\\n pleasure to the young novelist\\'s\\n heart when he looked up from his\\n clattering machine.\\n\\n\\n He wrote \"thrilling action romances,\"\\n as his enthusiastic publishers\\n and television directors\\n said, \"of ages past, when men\\n were men. Red-blooded heroes responding\\n vigorously to the stirring\\n passions of primordial life!\"\\nHe\\n was impartial as to the\\n source of his thrills—provided\\n they were distant enough\\n from modern civilization. His\\n hero was likely to be an ape-man\\n roaring through the jungle, with\\n a bloody rock in one hand and\\n a beautiful girl in the other.\\n Or a cowboy, \"hard-riding, hard-shooting,\"\\n the vanishing hero of\\n the ancient ranches. Or a man\\n marooned with a lovely woman\\n on a desert South Sea island.\\n His heroes were invariably\\n strong, fearless, resourceful fellows,\\n who could handle a club on\\n equal terms with a cave-man, or\\n call science to aid them in defending\\n a beautiful mate from\\n the terrors of a desolate wilderness.\\n\\n\\n And a hundred million read\\n Eric\\'s novels, and watched the\\n dramatization of them on the\\n television screens. They thrilled\\n at the simple, romantic lives his\\n heroes led, paid him handsome\\n royalties, and subconsciously\\n shared his opinion that civilization\\n had taken all the best from\\n the life of man.\\n\\n\\n Eric had settled down to the\\n artistic satisfaction of describing\\n the sensuous delight of his\\n hero in the roasted marrow-bones\\n of a dead mammoth, when\\n the pretty woman in the other\\n room stirred, and presently came\\n tripping into the study, gay and\\n vivacious, and—as her husband\\n of a few months most justly\\n thought—altogether beautiful in\\n a bright silk dressing gown.\\n\\n\\n Recklessly, he slammed the\\n machine back into its place, and\\n resolved to forget that his next\\n \"red-blooded action thriller\" was\\n due in the publisher\\'s office at the\\n end of the month. He sprang up\\n to kiss his wife, held her embraced\\n for a long happy moment.\\n And then they went hand in\\n hand, to the side of the room and\\n punched a series of buttons on a\\n panel—a simple way of ordering\\n breakfast sent up the automatic\\n shaft from the kitchens below.\\n\\n\\n Nada Stokes-Harding was also\\n an author. She wrote poems—\"back\\n to nature stuff\"—simple\\n lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of\\n bird songs, of bright flowers and\\n warm winds, of thrilling communion\\n with Nature, and growing\\n things. Men read her poems\\n and called her a genius. Even\\n though the whole world had\\n grown up into a city, the birds\\n were extinct, there were no wild\\n flowers, and no one had time to\\n bother about sunsets.\\n\\n\\n \"Eric, darling,\" she said, \"isn\\'t\\n it terrible to be cooped up here\\n in this little flat, away from the\\n things we both love?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, dear. Civilization has\\n ruined the world. If we could only\\n have lived a thousand years ago,\\n when life was simple and natural,\\n when men hunted and killed their\\n meat, instead of drinking synthetic\\n stuff, when men still had\\n the joys of conflict, instead of\\n living under glass, like hot-house\\n flowers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If we could only go somewhere—\"\\n\\n\\n \"There isn\\'t anywhere to go. I\\n write about the West, Africa,\\n South Sea Islands. But they\\n were all filled up two hundred\\n years ago. Pleasure resorts, sanatoriums,\\n cities, factories.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If only we lived on Venus!\\n I was listening to a lecture on\\n the television, last night. The\\n speaker said that the Planet\\n Venus is younger than the Earth,\\n that it has not cooled so much. It\\n has a thick, cloudy atmosphere,\\n and low, rainy forests. There\\'s\\n simple, elemental life there—like\\n Earth had before civilization\\n ruined it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red\\n ray telescope, that penetrates\\n the cloud layers of the\\n planet, proved that Venus rotates\\n in about the same period as\\n Earth; and it must be much like\\n Earth was a million years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eric, I wonder if we could go\\n there! It would be so thrilling to\\n begin life like the characters in\\n your stories, to get away from\\n this hateful civilization, and live\\n natural lives. Maybe a rocket—\"\\nThe\\n young author\\'s eyes were\\n glowing. He skipped across the\\n floor, seized Nada, kissed her\\n ecstatically. \"Splendid! Think of\\n hunting in the virgin forest, and\\n bringing the game home to you!\\n But I\\'m afraid there is no way.—Wait!\\n The Cosmic Express.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Cosmic Express?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A new invention. Just perfected\\n a few weeks ago, I understand.\\n By Ludwig Von der Valls,\\n the German physicist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve quit bothering about science.\\n It has ruined nature, filled\\n the world with silly, artificial\\n people, doing silly, artificial\\n things.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But this is quite remarkable,\\n dear. A new way to travel—by\\n ether!\"\\n\\n\\n \"By ether!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. You know of course that\\n energy and matter are interchangeable\\n terms; both are simply\\n etheric vibration, of different\\n sorts.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. That\\'s elementary.\"\\n She smiled proudly. \"I can\\n give you examples, even of the\\n change. The disintegration of the\\n radium atom, making helium\\n and lead and\\nenergy\\n. And Millikan\\'s\\n old proof that his Cosmic\\n Ray is generated when particles\\n of electricity are united to form\\n an atom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine! I thought you said you\\n weren\\'t a scientist.\" He glowed\\n with pride. \"But the method, in\\n the new Cosmic Express, is simply\\n to convert the matter to be\\n carried into power, send it out\\n as a radiant beam and focus the\\n beam to convert it back into\\n atoms at the destination.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the amount of energy\\n must be terrific—\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is. You know short waves\\n carry more energy than long\\n ones. The Express Ray is an\\n electromagnetic vibration of frequency\\n far higher than that of\\n even the Cosmic Ray, and correspondingly\\n more powerful and\\n more penetrating.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl frowned, running slim\\n fingers through golden-brown\\n hair. \"But I don\\'t see how they\\n get any recognizable object, not\\n even how they get the radiation\\n turned back into matter.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The beam is focused, just like\\n the light that passes through a\\n camera lens. The photographic\\n lens, using light rays, picks up a\\n picture and reproduces it again\\n on the plate—just the same as\\n the Express Ray picks up an\\n object and sets it down on the\\n other side of the world.\\n\\n\\n \"An analogy from television\\n might help. You know that by\\n means of the scanning disc, the\\n picture is transformed into mere\\n rapid fluctuations in the brightness\\n of a beam of light. In a\\n parallel manner, the focal plane\\n of the Express Ray moves slowly\\n through the object, progressively,\\n dissolving layers of the\\n thickness of a single atom, which\\n are accurately reproduced at the\\n other focus of the instrument—which\\n might be in Venus!\\n\\n\\n \"But the analogy of the lens\\n is the better of the two. For no\\n receiving instrument is required,\\n as in television. The object is\\n built up of an infinite series of\\n plane layers, at the focus of the\\n ray, no matter where that may\\n be. Such a thing would be impossible\\n with radio apparatus\\n because even with the best beam\\n transmission, all but a tiny fraction\\n of the power is lost, and\\n power is required to rebuild the\\n atoms. Do you understand,\\n dear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not altogether. But I should\\n worry! Here comes breakfast.\\n Let me butter your toast.\"\\n\\n\\n A bell had rung at the shaft.\\n She ran to it, and returned with\\n a great silver tray, laden with\\n dainty dishes, which she set on a\\n little side table. They sat down\\n opposite each other, and ate, getting\\n as much satisfaction from\\n contemplation of each other\\'s\\n faces as from the excellent food.\\n When they had finished, she carried\\n the tray to the shaft, slid\\n it in a slot, and touched a button—thus\\n disposing of the culinary\\n cares of the morning.\\n\\n\\n She ran back to Eric, who was\\n once more staring distastefully\\n at his typewriter.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, darling! I\\'m thrilled to\\n death about the Cosmic Express!\\n If we could go to Venus, to a new\\n life on a new world, and get\\n away from all this hateful conventional\\n society—\"\\n\\n\\n \"We can go to their office—it\\'s\\n only five minutes. The chap\\n that operates the machine for\\n the company is a pal of mine.\\n He\\'s not supposed to take passengers\\n except between the offices\\n they have scattered about the\\n world. But I know his weak\\n point—\"\\n\\n\\n Eric laughed, fumbled with a\\n hidden spring under his desk. A\\n small polished object, gleaming\\n silvery, slid down into his hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Old friendship,\\nplus\\nthis,\\n would make him—like spinach.\"\\nFive\\n minutes later Mr. Eric\\n Stokes-Harding and his pretty\\n wife were in street clothes,\\n light silk tunics of loose, flowing\\n lines—little clothing being required\\n in the artificially warmed\\n city. They entered an elevator\\n and dropped thirty stories to the\\n ground floor of the great building.\\n\\n\\n There they entered a cylindrical\\n car, with rows of seats down\\n the sides. Not greatly different\\n from an ancient subway car, except\\n that it was air-tight, and\\n was hurled by magnetic attraction\\n and repulsion through a\\n tube exhausted of air, at a speed\\n that would have made an old\\n subway rider gasp with amazement.\\n\\n\\n In five more minutes their car\\n had whipped up to the base of\\n another building, in the business\\n section, where there was no room\\n for parks between the mighty\\n structures that held the unbroken\\n glass roofs two hundred stories\\n above the concrete pavement.\\n\\n\\n An elevator brought them up a\\n hundred and fifty stories. Eric\\n led Nada down a long, carpeted\\n corridor to a wide glass door,\\n which bore the words:\\nCOSMIC EXPRESS\\nstenciled in gold capitals across\\n it.\\n\\n\\n As they approached, a lean\\n man, carrying a black bag, darted\\n out of an elevator shaft opposite\\n the door, ran across the corridor,\\n and entered. They pushed in after\\n him.\\n\\n\\n They were in a little room,\\n cut in two by a high brass grill.\\n In front of it was a long bench\\n against the wall, that reminded\\n one of the waiting room in an old\\n railroad depot. In the grill was a\\n little window, with a lazy, brown-eyed\\n youth leaning on the shelf\\n behind it. Beyond him was a\\n great, glittering piece of mechanism,\\n half hidden by the brass.\\n A little door gave access to the\\n machine from the space before\\n the grill.\\n\\n\\n The thin man in black, whom\\n Eric now recognized as a prominent\\n French heart-specialist, was\\n dancing before the window, waving\\n his bag frantically, raving at\\n the sleepy boy.\\n\\n\\n \"Queek! I have tell you zee\\n truth! I have zee most urgent\\n necessity to go queekly. A patient\\n I have in Paree, zat ees in\\n zee most creetical condition!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold your horses just a minute,\\n Mister. We got a client in\\n the machine now. Russian diplomat\\n from Moscow to Rio de\\n Janeiro.... Two hundred seventy\\n dollars and eighty cents,\\n please.... Your turn next. Remember\\n this is just an experimental\\n service. Regular installations\\n all over the world in a year....\\n Ready now. Come on in.\"\\n\\n\\n The youth took the money,\\n pressed a button. The door\\n sprang open in the grill, and the\\n frantic physician leaped through\\n it.\\n\\n\\n \"Lie down on the crystal, face\\n up,\" the young man ordered.\\n \"Hands at your sides, don\\'t\\n breathe. Ready!\"\\n\\n\\n He manipulated his dials and\\n switches, and pressed another\\n button.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, hello, Eric, old man!\"\\n he cried. \"That\\'s the lady you\\n were telling me about? Congratulations!\"\\n A bell jangled before\\n him on the panel. \"Just a minute.\\n I\\'ve got a call.\"\\n\\n\\n He punched the board again.\\n Little bulbs lit and glowed for a\\n second. The youth turned toward\\n the half-hidden machine, spoke\\n courteously.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, madam. Walk out.\\n Hope you found the transit pleasant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But my Violet! My precious\\n Violet!\" a shrill female voice\\n came from the machine. \"Sir,\\n what have you done with my\\n darling Violet?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know, madam.\\n You lost it off your hat?\"\\n\\n\\n \"None of your impertinence,\\n sir! I want my dog.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, a dog. Must have jumped\\n off the crystal. You can have\\n him sent on for three hundred\\n and—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Young man, if any harm\\n comes to my Violet—I\\'ll—I\\'ll—I\\'ll\\n appeal to the Society for the\\n Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very good, madam. We appreciate\\n your patronage.\"\\nThe\\n door flew open again.\\n A very fat woman, puffing\\n angrily, face highly colored,\\n clothing shimmering with artificial\\n gems, waddled pompously\\n out of the door through which\\n the frantic French doctor had\\n so recently vanished. She rolled\\n heavily across the room, and out\\n into the corridor. Shrill words\\n floated back:\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to see my lawyer!\\n My precious Violet—\"\\n\\n\\n The sallow youth winked.\\n \"And now what can I do for you,\\n Eric?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We want to go to Venus, if\\n that ray of yours can put us\\n there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To Venus? Impossible. My\\n orders are to use the Express\\n merely between the sixteen designated\\n stations, at New York,\\n San Francisco, Tokyo, London,\\n Paris—\"\\n\\n\\n \"See here, Charley,\" with a\\n cautious glance toward the door,\\n Eric held up the silver flask.\\n \"For old time\\'s sake, and for\\n this—\"\\n\\n\\n The boy seemed dazed at sight\\n of the bright flask. Then, with a\\n single swift motion, he snatched\\n it out of Eric\\'s hand, and bent\\n to conceal it below his instrument\\n panel.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, old boy. I\\'d send you to\\n heaven for that, if you\\'d give me\\n the micrometer readings to set\\n the ray with. But I tell you, this\\n is dangerous. I\\'ve got a sort of\\n television attachment, for focusing\\n the ray. I can turn that on\\n Venus—I\\'ve been amusing myself,\\n watching the life there, already.\\n Terrible place. Savage. I\\n can pick a place on high land to\\n set you down. But I can\\'t be responsible\\n for what happens afterward.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Simple, primitive life is what\\n we\\'re looking for. And now what\\n do I owe you—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, that\\'s all right. Between\\n friends. Provided that stuff\\'s\\n genuine! Walk in and lie down on\\n the crystal block. Hands at your\\n sides. Don\\'t move.\"\\n\\n\\n The little door had swung\\n open again, and Eric led Nada\\n through. They stepped into a little\\n cell, completely surrounded\\n with mirrors and vast prisms\\n and lenses and electron tubes. In\\n the center was a slab of transparent\\n crystal, eight feet square\\n and two inches thick, with an\\n intricate mass of machinery below\\n it.\\n\\n\\n Eric helped Nada to a place\\n on the crystal, lay down at her\\n side.\\n\\n\\n \"I think the Express Ray is\\n focused just at the surface of the\\n crystal, from below,\" he said. \"It\\n dissolves our substance, to be\\n transmitted by the beam. It\\n would look as if we were melting\\n into the crystal.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready,\" called the youth.\\n \"Think I\\'ve got it for you. Sort\\n of a high island in the jungle.\\n Nothing bad in sight now. But,\\n I say—how\\'re you coming back?\\n I haven\\'t got time to watch you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go ahead. We aren\\'t coming\\n back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gee! What is it? Elopement?\\n I thought you were married already.\\n Or is it business difficulties?\\n The Bears did make an awful\\n raid last night. But you better\\n let me set you down in Hong\\n Kong.\"\\n\\n\\n A bell jangled. \"So long,\" the\\n youth called.\\n\\n\\n Nada and Eric felt themselves\\n enveloped in fire. Sheets of white\\n flame seemed to lap up about\\n them from the crystal block. Suddenly\\n there was a sharp tingling\\n sensation where they touched\\n the polished surface. Then blackness,\\n blankness.\\nThe\\n next thing they knew, the\\n fires were gone from about\\n them. They were lying in something\\n extremely soft and fluid;\\n and warm rain was beating in\\n their faces. Eric sat up, found\\n himself in a mud-puddle. Beside\\n him was Nada, opening her eyes\\n and struggling up, her bright\\n garments stained with black\\n mud.\\n\\n\\n All about rose a thick jungle,\\n dark and gloomy—and very wet.\\n Palm-like, the gigantic trees\\n were, or fern-like, flinging clouds\\n of feathery green foliage high\\n against a somber sky of unbroken\\n gloom.\\n\\n\\n They stood up, triumphant.\\n\\n\\n \"At last!\" Nada cried. \"We\\'re\\n free! Free of that hateful old\\n civilization! We\\'re back to Nature!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, we\\'re on our feet now,\\n not parasites on the machines.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s wonderful to have a fine,\\n strong man like you to trust in,\\n Eric. You\\'re just like one of the\\n heroes in your books!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re the perfect companion,\\n Nada.... But now we\\n must be practical. We must\\n build a fire, find weapons, set up\\n a shelter of some kind. I guess it\\n will be night, pretty soon. And\\n Charley said something about\\n savage animals he had seen in\\n the television.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll find a nice dry cave,\\n and have a fire in front of the\\n door. And skins of animals to\\n sleep on. And pottery vessels to\\n cook in. And you will find seeds\\n and grown grain.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But first we must find a flint-bed.\\n We need flint for tools, and\\n to strike sparks to make a fire\\n with. We will probably come\\n across a chunk of virgin copper,\\n too—it\\'s found native.\"\\n\\n\\n Presently they set off through\\n the jungle. The mud seemed to\\n be very abundant, and of a most\\n sticky consistence. They sank\\n into it ankle deep at every step,\\n and vast masses of it clung to\\n their feet. A mile they struggled\\n on, without finding where a provident\\n nature had left them even\\n a single fragment of quartz, to\\n say nothing of a mass of pure\\n copper.\\n\\n\\n \"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled,\\n \"to come forty million\\n miles, and meet such a reception\\n as this!\"\\n\\n\\n Nada stopped. \"Eric,\" she\\n said, \"I\\'m tired. And I don\\'t believe\\n there\\'s any rock here, anyway.\\n You\\'ll have to use wooden\\n tools, sharpened in the fire.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Probably you\\'re right. This\\n soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.\\n Shouldn\\'t be surprised if\\n the native rock is some hundreds\\n of feet underground. Your\\n idea is better.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can make a fire by rubbing\\n sticks together, can\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It can be done, I\\'m sure. I\\'ve\\n never tried it, myself. We need\\n some dry sticks, first.\"\\n\\n\\n They resumed the weary\\n march, with a good fraction of\\n the new planet adhering to their\\n feet. Rain was still falling from\\n the dark heavens in a steady,\\n warm downpour. Dry wood\\n seemed scarce as the proverbial\\n hen\\'s teeth.\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t bring any matches,\\n dear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Matches! Of course not!\\n We\\'re going back to Nature.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hope we get a fire pretty\\n soon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If dry wood were gold dust,\\n we couldn\\'t buy a hot dog.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eric, that reminds me that\\n I\\'m hungry.\"\\n\\n\\n He confessed to a few pangs of\\n his own. They turned their attention\\n to looking for banana\\n trees, and coconut palms, but\\n they did not seem to abound in\\n the Venerian jungle. Even small\\n animals that might have been\\n slain with a broken branch had\\n contrary ideas about the matter.\\n\\n\\n At last, from sheer weariness,\\n they stopped, and gathered\\n branches to make a sloping shelter\\n by a vast fallen tree-trunk.\\n\\n\\n \"This will keep out the rain—maybe—\"\\n Eric said hopefully.\\n \"And tomorrow, when it has quit\\n raining—I\\'m sure we\\'ll do better.\"\\n\\n\\n They crept in, as gloomy night\\n fell without. They lay in each\\n other\\'s arms, the body warmth\\n oddly comforting. Nada cried a\\n little.\\n\\n\\n \"Buck up,\" Eric advised her.\\n \"We\\'re back to nature—where\\n we\\'ve always wanted to be.\"\\nWith\\n the darkness, the temperature\\n fell somewhat, and\\n a high wind rose, whipping cold\\n rain into the little shelter, and\\n threatening to demolish it.\\n Swarms of mosquito-like insects,\\n seemingly not inconvenienced in\\n the least by the inclement elements,\\n swarmed about them in\\n clouds.\\n\\n\\n Then came a sound from the\\n dismal stormy night, a hoarse,\\n bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.\\n\\n\\n Nada clung against Eric.\\n \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.\\n\\n\\n \"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur,\\n or something of the sort. This\\n world seems to be in about the\\n same state as the Earth when\\n they flourished there.... But\\n maybe it won\\'t find us.\"\\n\\n\\n The roar was repeated, nearer.\\n The earth trembled beneath a\\n mighty tread.\\n\\n\\n \"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled.\\n \"Don\\'t you think—it might have\\n been better— You know the old\\n life was not so bad, after all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was just thinking of our\\n rooms, nice and warm and\\n bright, with hot foods coming up\\n the shaft whenever we pushed\\n the button, and the gay crowds\\n in the park, and my old typewriter.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eric?\" she called softly.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, dear.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you wish—we had\\n known better?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I do.\" If he winced at the\\n \"we\" the girl did not notice.\\n\\n\\n The roaring outside was closer.\\n And suddenly it was answered\\n by another raucous bellow, at\\n considerable distance, that echoed\\n strangely through the forest.\\n The fearful sounds were repeated,\\n alternately. And always\\n the more distant seemed nearer,\\n until the two sounds were together.\\n\\n\\n And then an infernal din\\n broke out in the darkness. Bellows.\\n Screams. Deafening\\n shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if\\n struggling Titans had upset\\n oceans. Thunderous crashes, as\\n if they were demolishing forests.\\n\\n\\n Eric and Nada clung to each\\n other, in doubt whether to stay\\n or to fly through the storm.\\n Gradually the sound of the conflict\\n came nearer, until the earth\\n shook beneath them, and they\\n were afraid to move.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly the great fallen tree\\n against which they had erected\\n the flimsy shelter was rolled\\n back, evidently by a chance blow\\n from the invisible monsters. The\\n pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled\\n humans. Nada burst\\n into tears.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, if only—if only—\"\\nSuddenly\\n flame lapped up\\n about them, the same white\\n fire they had seen as they lay on\\n the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility\\n overcame them. A few\\n moments later, they were lying\\n on the transparent table in the\\n Cosmic Express office, with all\\n those great mirrors and prisms\\n and lenses about them.\\n\\n\\n A bustling, red-faced official\\n appeared through the door in the\\n grill, fairly bubbling apologies.\\n\\n\\n \"So sorry—an accident—inconceivable.\\n I can\\'t see how he\\n got it! We got you back as soon\\n as we could find a focus. I sincerely\\n hope you haven\\'t been injured.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why—what—what—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why I happened in, found\\n our operator drunk. I\\'ve no idea\\n where he got the stuff. He muttered\\n something about Venus. I\\n consulted the auto-register, and\\n found two more passengers registered\\n here than had been recorded\\n at our other stations. I\\n looked up the duplicate beam coordinates,\\n and found that it had\\n been set on Venus. I got men on\\n the television at once, and we\\n happened to find you.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t imagine how it happened.\\n I\\'ve had the fellow locked\\n up, and the \\'dry-laws\\' are on the\\n job. I hope you won\\'t hold us for\\n excessive damages.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, I ask nothing except that\\n you don\\'t press charges against\\n the boy. I don\\'t want him to suffer\\n for it in any way.

Oh,\\nI\\'m A Stranger\\n \\nHere Myself\\nBy MACK REYNOLDS\\nThe\\n Place de France is the\\n town\\'s hub. It marks the end\\n of Boulevard Pasteur, the main\\n drag of the westernized part of\\n the city, and the beginning of\\n Rue de la Liberté, which leads\\n down to the Grand Socco and\\n the medina. In a three-minute\\n walk from the Place de France\\n you can go from an ultra-modern,\\n California-like resort to the\\n Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s quite a town, Tangier.\\n\\n\\n King-size sidewalk cafes occupy\\n three of the strategic\\n corners on the Place de France.\\n The Cafe de Paris serves the\\n best draft beer in town, gets all\\n the better custom, and has three\\n shoeshine boys attached to the\\n establishment. You can sit of a\\n sunny morning and read the\\n Paris edition of the New York\\nHerald Tribune\\nwhile getting\\n your shoes done up like mirrors\\n for thirty Moroccan francs\\n which comes to about five cents\\n at current exchange.\\n\\n\\n You can sit there, after the\\n paper\\'s read, sip your expresso\\n and watch the people go by.\\n\\n\\n Tangier is possibly the most\\n cosmopolitan city in the world.\\n In native costume you\\'ll see\\n Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue\\n Man, and occasionally a Senegalese\\n from further south. In\\n European dress you\\'ll see Japs\\n and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,\\n Levantines and Filipinos, North\\n Americans and South Americans,\\n and, of course, even Europeans—from\\n both sides of the\\n Curtain.\\n\\n\\n In Tangier you\\'ll find some of\\n the world\\'s poorest and some of\\n the richest. The poorest will try\\n to sell you anything from a\\n shoeshine to their not very lily-white\\n bodies, and the richest will\\n avoid your eyes, afraid\\nyou\\nmight try to sell them something.\\n\\n\\n In spite of recent changes, the\\n town still has its unique qualities.\\n As a result of them the permanent\\n population includes\\n smugglers and black-marketeers,\\n fugitives from justice and international\\n con men, espionage\\n and counter-espionage agents,\\n homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,\\n drug addicts, displaced\\n persons, ex-royalty, and subversives\\n of every flavor. Local law\\n limits the activities of few of\\n these.\\n\\n\\n Like I said, it\\'s quite a town.\\nI looked up from my\\nHerald\\n Tribune\\nand said, \"Hello, Paul.\\n Anything new cooking?\"\\n\\n\\n He sank into the chair opposite\\n me and looked around for\\n the waiter. The tables were all\\n crowded and since mine was a\\n face he recognized, he assumed\\n he was welcome to intrude. It was\\n more or less standard procedure\\n at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn\\'t\\n a place to go if you wanted to\\n be alone.\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"How are you,\\n Rupert? Haven\\'t seen you for\\n donkey\\'s years.\"\\n\\n\\n The waiter came along and\\n Paul ordered a glass of beer.\\n Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced\\n little man. I vaguely remembered\\n somebody saying he\\n was from Liverpool and in\\n exports.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s in the newspaper?\"\\n he said, disinterestedly.\\n\\n\\n \"Pogo and Albert are going\\n to fight a duel,\" I told him, \"and\\n Lil Abner is becoming a rock\\'n\\'roll\\n singer.\"\\n\\n\\n He grunted.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said, \"the intellectual\\n type.\" I scanned the front page.\\n \"The Russkies have put up\\n another manned satellite.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They have, eh? How big?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Several times bigger than\\n anything we Americans have.\"\\n\\n\\n The beer came and looked\\n good, so I ordered a glass too.\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"What ever happened\\n to those poxy flying\\n saucers?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What flying saucers?\"\\n\\n\\n A French girl went by with a\\n poodle so finely clipped as to look\\n as though it\\'d been shaven. The\\n girl was in the latest from\\n Paris. Every pore in place. We\\n both looked after her.\\n\\n\\n \"You know, what everybody\\n was seeing a few years ago. It\\'s\\n too bad one of these bloody manned\\n satellites wasn\\'t up then.\\n Maybe they would\\'ve seen one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s an idea,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n We didn\\'t say anything else for\\n a while and I began to wonder\\n if I could go back to my paper\\n without rubbing him the wrong\\n way. I didn\\'t know Paul very\\n well, but, for that matter, it\\'s\\n comparatively seldom you ever\\n get to know anybody very well\\n in Tangier. Largely, cards are\\n played close to the chest.\\nMy beer came and a plate of\\n tapas for us both. Tapas at the\\n Cafe de Paris are apt to be\\n potato salad, a few anchovies,\\n olives, and possibly some cheese.\\n Free lunch, they used to call it\\n in the States.\\n\\n\\n Just to say something, I said,\\n \"Where do you think they came\\n from?\" And when he looked\\n blank, I added, \"The Flying\\n Saucers.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned. \"From Mars or\\n Venus, or someplace.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ummmm,\" I said. \"Too bad\\n none of them ever crashed, or\\n landed on the Yale football field\\n and said\\nTake me to your cheerleader\\n,\\n or something.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul yawned and said, \"That\\n was always the trouble with those\\n crackpot blokes\\' explanations of\\n them. If they were aliens from\\n space, then why not show themselves?\"\\n\\n\\n I ate one of the potato chips.\\n It\\'d been cooked in rancid olive\\n oil.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Oh, there are various\\n answers to that one. We could\\n probably sit around here and\\n think of two or three that made\\n sense.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul was mildly interested.\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, hell, suppose for instance\\n there\\'s this big Galactic League\\n of civilized planets. But it\\'s restricted,\\n see. You\\'re not eligible\\n for membership until you, well,\\n say until you\\'ve developed space\\n flight. Then you\\'re invited into\\n the club. Meanwhile, they send\\n secret missions down from time\\n to time to keep an eye on your\\n progress.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul grinned at me. \"I see you\\n read the same poxy stuff I do.\"\\n\\n\\n A Moorish girl went by dressed\\n in a neatly tailored gray\\n jellaba, European style high-heeled\\n shoes, and a pinkish silk\\n veil so transparent that you\\n could see she wore lipstick. Very\\n provocative, dark eyes can be\\n over a veil. We both looked\\n after her.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Or, here\\'s another\\n one. Suppose you have a very\\n advanced civilization on, say,\\n Mars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not Mars. No air, and too\\n bloody dry to support life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t interrupt, please,\" I\\n said with mock severity. \"This\\n is a very old civilization and as\\n the planet began to lose its\\n water and air, it withdrew underground.\\n Uses hydroponics and\\n so forth, husbands its water and\\n air. Isn\\'t that what we\\'d do, in\\n a few million years, if Earth lost\\n its water and air?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Anyway,\\n what about them?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, they observe how man\\n is going through a scientific\\n boom, an industrial boom, a\\n population boom. A boom, period.\\n Any day now he\\'s going to have\\n practical space ships. Meanwhile,\\n he\\'s also got the H-Bomb and\\n the way he beats the drums on\\n both sides of the Curtain, he\\'s\\n not against using it, if he could\\n get away with it.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"I got it. So they\\'re\\n scared and are keeping an eye on\\n us. That\\'s an old one. I\\'ve read\\n that a dozen times, dished up\\n different.\"\\n\\n\\n I shifted my shoulders. \"Well,\\n it\\'s one possibility.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got a better one. How\\'s\\n this. There\\'s this alien life form\\n that\\'s way ahead of us. Their\\n civilization is so old that they\\n don\\'t have any records of when\\n it began and how it was in the\\n early days. They\\'ve gone beyond\\n things like wars and depressions\\n and revolutions, and greed for\\n power or any of these things\\n giving us a bad time here on\\n Earth. They\\'re all like scholars,\\n get it? And some of them are\\n pretty jolly well taken by Earth,\\n especially the way we are right\\n now, with all the problems, get\\n it? Things developing so fast we\\n don\\'t know where we\\'re going\\n or how we\\'re going to get there.\"\\nI finished my beer and clapped\\n my hands for Mouley. \"How do\\n you mean,\\nwhere we\\'re going\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, take half the countries\\n in the world today. They\\'re trying\\n to industrialize, modernize,\\n catch up with the advanced countries.\\n Look at Egypt, and Israel,\\n and India and China, and Yugoslavia\\n and Brazil, and all the\\n rest. Trying to drag themselves\\n up to the level of the advanced\\n countries, and all using different\\n methods of doing it. But look\\n at the so-called advanced countries.\\n Up to their bottoms in\\n problems. Juvenile delinquents,\\n climbing crime and suicide rates,\\n the loony-bins full of the balmy,\\n unemployed, threat of war,\\n spending all their money on armaments\\n instead of things like\\n schools. All the bloody mess of\\n it. Why, a man from Mars would\\n be fascinated, like.\"\\n\\n\\n Mouley came shuffling up in\\n his babouche slippers and we\\n both ordered another schooner\\n of beer.\\n\\n\\n Paul said seriously, \"You\\n know, there\\'s only one big snag\\n in this sort of talk. I\\'ve sorted\\n the whole thing out before, and\\n you always come up against this\\n brick wall. Where are they, these\\n observers, or scholars, or spies\\n or whatever they are? Sooner\\n or later we\\'d nab one of them.\\n You know, Scotland Yard, or\\n the F.B.I., or Russia\\'s secret\\n police, or the French Sûreté, or\\n Interpol. This world is so deep\\n in police, counter-espionage outfits\\n and security agents that an\\n alien would slip up in time, no\\n matter how much he\\'d been\\n trained. Sooner or later, he\\'d slip\\n up, and they\\'d nab him.\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Not necessarily.\\n The first time I ever considered\\n this possibility, it seemed\\n to me that such an alien would\\n base himself in London or New\\n York. Somewhere where he could\\n use the libraries for research,\\n get the daily newspapers and\\n the magazines. Be right in the\\n center of things. But now I don\\'t\\n think so. I think he\\'d be right\\n here in Tangier.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why Tangier?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s the one town in the world\\n where anything goes. Nobody\\n gives a damn about you or your\\n affairs. For instance, I\\'ve known\\n you a year or more now, and I\\n haven\\'t the slightest idea of how\\n you make your living.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Paul admitted.\\n \"In this town you seldom even\\n ask a man where\\'s he\\'s from. He\\n can be British, a White Russian,\\n a Basque or a Sikh and nobody\\n could care less. Where are\\nyou\\nfrom, Rupert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"California,\" I told him.\\n\\n\\n \"No, you\\'re not,\" he grinned.\\n\\n\\n I was taken aback. \"What do\\n you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I felt your mind probe back\\n a few minutes ago when I was\\n talking about Scotland Yard or\\n the F.B.I. possibly flushing an\\n alien. Telepathy is a sense not\\n trained by the humanoids. If\\n they had it, your job—and mine—would\\n be considerably more\\n difficult. Let\\'s face it, in spite of\\n these human bodies we\\'re disguised\\n in, neither of us is\\n humanoid. Where are you really\\n from, Rupert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Aldebaran,\" I said. \"How\\n about you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Deneb,\" he told me, shaking.\\n\\n\\n We had a laugh and ordered\\n another beer.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'re you doing here on\\n Earth?\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \"Researching for one of our\\n meat trusts. We\\'re protein\\n eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered\\n quite a delicacy. How\\n about you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Scouting the place for thrill\\n tourists. My job is to go around\\n to these backward cultures and\\n help stir up inter-tribal, or international,\\n conflicts—all according\\n to how advanced they\\n are. Then our tourists come in—well\\n shielded, of course—and get\\n their kicks watching it.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul frowned. \"That sort of\\n practice could spoil an awful\\n lot of good meat.\"\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Stories\\nDecember 1960.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

They\\n need adult guidance of course, and\\n one of the group suggested my name.\"\\n\\n\\n I should explain, perhaps, that I\\n teach a course in general science in\\n our Ridgeville Junior High School,\\n and another in general physics in the\\n Senior High School. It\\'s a privilege\\n which I\\'m sure many educators must\\n envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our\\n new school is a fine one, and our\\n academic standards are high. On the\\n other hand, the fathers of most of\\n my students work for the Commission\\n and a constant awareness of the Commission\\n and its work pervades the\\n town. It is an uneasy privilege then,\\n at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned\\n brand of science to these\\n children of a new age.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s very nice,\" said Marjorie.\\n \"What does a junior achievement\\n group do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,\\n \"of teaching the members something\\n about commerce and industry. They\\n manufacture simple compositions\\n like polishing waxes and sell them\\n from door-to-door. Some groups have\\n built up tidy little bank accounts\\n which are available for later educational\\n expenses.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gracious, you wouldn\\'t have to\\n sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not. I\\'d just tell the\\n kids how to do it.\"\\n\\n\\n Marjorie put back her head and\\n laughed, and I was forced to join her,\\n for we both recognize that my understanding\\n and \"feel\" for commercial\\n matters—if I may use that expression—is\\n almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at\\n my commercial aspirations. But don\\'t\\n worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack\\n said we could get Mr. Wells from\\n Commercial Department to help out\\n if he was needed. There is one problem,\\n though. Mr. McCormack is going\\n to put up fifty dollars to buy any\\n raw materials wanted and he rather\\n suggested that I might advance another\\n fifty. The question is, could we\\n do it?\"\\n\\n\\n Marjorie did mental arithmetic.\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it\\'s something\\n you\\'d like to do.\"\\n\\n\\n We\\'ve had to watch such things\\n rather closely for the last ten—no,\\n eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,\\n fifty-odd miles to the south, we\\n had our home almost paid for, when\\n the accident occurred. It was in the\\n path of the heaviest fallout, and we\\n couldn\\'t have kept on living there\\n even if the town had stayed. When\\n Ridgeville moved to its present site,\\n so, of course, did we, which meant\\n starting mortgage payments all over\\n again.\\nThus it was that on a Wednesday\\n morning about three weeks later, I\\n was sitting at one end of a plank picnic\\n table with five boys and girls\\n lined up along the sides. This was to\\n be our headquarters and factory for\\n the summer—a roomy unused barn\\n belonging to the parents of one of\\n the group members, Tommy Miller.\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let\\'s relax. You\\n don\\'t need to treat me as a teacher,\\n you know. I stopped being a school\\n teacher when the final grades went in\\n last Friday. I\\'m on vacation now. My\\n job here is only to advise, and I\\'m\\n going to do that as little as possible.\\n You\\'re going to decide what to do,\\n and if it\\'s safe and legal and possible\\n to do with the starting capital we\\n have, I\\'ll go along with it and help\\n in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. McCormack had told me, and\\n in some detail, about the youngsters\\n I\\'d be dealing with. The three who\\n were sitting to my left were the ones\\n who had proposed the group in the\\n first place.\\n\\n\\n Doris Enright was a grave young\\n lady of ten years, who might, I\\n thought, be quite a beauty in a few\\n more years, but was at the moment\\n rather angular—all shoulders and elbows.\\n Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack\\n were skinny kids, too. The three\\n were of an age and were all tall for\\n ten-year-olds.\\n\\n\\n I had the impression during that\\n first meeting that they looked rather\\n alike, but this wasn\\'t so. Their features\\n were quite different. Perhaps\\n from association, for they were close\\n friends, they had just come to have\\n a certain similarity of restrained gesture\\n and of modulated voice. And\\n they were all tanned by sun and wind\\n to a degree that made their eyes seem\\n light and their teeth startlingly white.\\n\\n\\n The two on my right were cast in\\n a different mold. Mary McCready\\n was a big husky redhead of twelve,\\n with a face full of freckles and an\\n infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,\\n a few months younger, was just an\\n average, extroverted, well adjusted\\n youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted\\n and butch-barbered.\\n\\n\\n The group exchanged looks to see\\n who would lead off, and Peter Cope\\n seemed to be elected.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior\\n achievement group is a bunch of kids\\n who get together to manufacture and\\n sell things, and maybe make some\\n money.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that what you want to do,\" I\\n asked, \"make money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.\\n \"There\\'s something wrong with making\\n money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"\\n said Hilary. \"We\\'ll need some money\\n to do the things we want to do later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And what sort of things would\\n you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n The usual products, of course, with\\n these junior achievement efforts, are\\n chemical specialties that can be made\\n safely and that people will buy and\\n use without misgivings—solvent to\\n free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove\\n road tar, mechanic\\'s hand soap—that\\n sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had\\n told me, though, that I might find\\n these youngsters a bit more ambitious.\\n \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"\\n he had said, \"have exceptionally\\n high IQ\\'s—around one forty\\n or one fifty. The other three are hard\\n to classify. They have some of the\\n attributes of exceptional pupils, but\\n much of the time they seem to have\\n little interest in their studies. The\\n junior achievement idea has sparked\\n their imaginations. Maybe it\\'ll be just\\n what they need.\"\\n\\n\\n Mary said, \"Why don\\'t we make a\\n freckle remover? I\\'d be our first customer.\"\\n\"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,\\n \"is to figure out what people in\\n Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it\\n to them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d like to make something by\\n powder metallurgy techniques,\" said\\n Pete. He fixed me with a challenging\\n eye. \"You should be able to make\\n ball bearings by molding, then densify\\n them by electroplating.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And all we\\'d need is a hydraulic\\n press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,\\n might cost ten thousand dollars. Let\\'s\\n think of something easier.\"\\n\\n\\n Pete mulled it over and nodded\\n reluctantly. \"Then maybe something\\n in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly\\n of some kind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary\\n put in.\\n\\n\\n \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"\\n I asked.\\n\\n\\n He was scornful. \"No, they\\'re formulations—you\\n know, mixtures.\\n That\\'s cookbook chemistry. I mean a\\n brand new synthetic detergent. I\\'ve\\n got an idea for one that ought to be\\n good even in the hard water we\\'ve\\n got around here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis\\n sounds like another operation\\n calling for capital investment. If we\\n should keep the achievement group\\n going for several summers, it might\\n be possible later on to carry out a\\n safe synthesis of some sort. You\\'re\\n Dr. Matlack\\'s son, aren\\'t you? Been\\n dipping into your father\\'s library?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I\\'ve got\\n a home laboratory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about you, Doris?\" I prompted.\\n \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No.\" She shook her head in mock\\n despondency. \"I\\'m not very technical.\\n Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the\\n group wanted to raise some mice, I\\'d\\n be willing to turn over a project I\\'ve\\n had going at home.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded\\n incredulously.\\n\\n\\n \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and\\n thought about it. \"Are they a pure\\n strain? One of the recognized laboratory\\n strains? Healthy mice of the\\n right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,\\n \"might be sold to laboratories. I have\\n an idea the Commission buys a supply\\n every month.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren\\'t laboratory\\n mice. They\\'re fancy ones. I\\n got the first four pairs from a pet\\n shop in Denver, but they\\'re red—sort\\n of chipmunk color, you know. I\\'ve\\n carried them through seventeen generations\\n of careful selection.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market\\n for red mice might be rather limited.\\n Why don\\'t you consider making\\n an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,\\n glycerine, water, a little color\\n and perfume. You could buy some\\n bottles and have some labels printed.\\n You\\'d be in business before you\\n knew it.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a pause, then Tommy\\n inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Door-to-door.\"\\n\\n\\n He made a face. \"Never build up\\n any volume. Unless it did something\\n extra. You say we\\'d put color in it.\\n How about enough color to leave\\n your face looking tanned. Men won\\'t\\n use cosmetics and junk, but if they\\n didn\\'t have to admit it, they might\\n like the shave lotion.\"\\n\\n\\n Hilary had been deep in thought.\\n He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I\\n know how to make a—what do you\\n want to call it—a before-shave lotion.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would that be?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d use it before you shaved.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose there might be people\\n who\\'d prefer to use it beforehand,\"\\n I conceded.\\n\\n\\n \"There will be people,\" he said\\n darkly, and subsided.\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Miller came out to the barn\\n after a while, bringing a bucket of\\n soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves\\n of bread and ingredients for a variety\\n of sandwiches. The parents had\\n agreed to underwrite lunches at the\\n barn and Betty Miller philosophically\\n assumed the role of commissary\\n officer. She paused only to say hello\\n and to ask how we were progressing\\n with our organization meeting.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d forgotten all about organization,\\n and that, according to all the\\n articles I had perused, is most important\\n to such groups. It\\'s standard practice\\n for every member of the group\\n to be a company officer. Of course a\\n young boy who doesn\\'t know any better,\\n may wind up a sales manager.\\n\\n\\n Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested\\n nominating company officers,\\n but they seemed not to be interested.\\n Peter Cope waved it off by remarking\\n that they\\'d each do what came\\n naturally. On the other hand, they\\n pondered at some length about a\\n name for the organization, without\\n reaching any conclusions, so we returned\\n to the problem of what to\\n make.\\n\\n\\n It was Mary, finally, who advanced\\n the thought of kites. At first there\\n was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,\\n \"You know, we could work up something\\n new. Has anybody ever seen a\\n kite made like a wind sock?\"\\n\\n\\n Nobody had. Pete drew figures in\\n the air with his hands. \"How about\\n the hole at the small end?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll make one tonight,\" said Doris,\\n \"and think about the small end.\\n It\\'ll work out all right.\"\\n\\n\\n I wished that the youngsters weren\\'t\\n starting out by inventing a new\\n article to manufacture, and risking an\\n almost certain disappointment, but to\\n hold my guidance to the minimum, I\\n said nothing, knowing that later I\\n could help them redesign it along\\n standard lines.\\nAt supper I reviewed the day\\'s\\n happenings with Marjorie and tried\\n to recall all of the ideas which had\\n been propounded. Most of them were\\n impractical, of course, for a group of\\n children to attempt, but several of\\n them appeared quite attractive.\\n\\n\\n Tommy, for example, wanted to\\n put tooth powder into tablets that\\n one would chew before brushing the\\n teeth. He thought there should be\\n two colors in the same bottle—orange\\n for morning and blue for night,\\n the blue ones designed to leave the\\n mouth alkaline at bed time.\\n\\n\\n Pete wanted to make a combination\\n nail and wood screw. You\\'d\\n drive it in with a hammer up to the\\n threaded part, then send it home with\\n a few turns of a screwdriver.\\n\\n\\n Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his\\n ideas on detergents, suggested we\\n make black plastic discs, like poker\\n chips but thinner and as cheap as\\n possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk\\n where they would pick up extra\\n heat from the sun and melt the\\n snow more rapidly. Afterward one\\n would sweep up and collect the discs.\\n\\n\\n Doris added to this that if you\\n could make the discs light enough to\\n float, they might be colored white\\n and spread on the surface of a reservoir\\n to reduce evaporation.\\n\\n\\n These latter ideas had made unknowing\\n use of some basic physics,\\n and I\\'m afraid I relapsed for a few\\n minutes into the role of teacher and\\n told them a little bit about the laws\\n of radiation and absorption of heat.\\n\\n\\n \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they\\'re really\\n smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller\\n does sound like a born salesman.\\n Somehow I don\\'t think you\\'re going\\n to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\\n\\n\\n I do feel just a little embarrassed\\n about the kite, even now. The fact\\n that it flew surprised me. That it flew\\n so confoundedly well was humiliating.\\n Four of them were at the barn\\n when I arrived next morning; or\\n rather on the rise of ground just beyond\\n it, and the kite hung motionless\\n and almost out of sight in the pale\\n sky. I stood and watched for a moment,\\n then they saw me.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,\\n and proffered the cord which was\\n wound on a fishing reel. I played the\\n kite up and down for a few minutes,\\n then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,\\n a wind sock, but the hole at the\\n small end was shaped—by wire—into\\n the general form of a kidney bean.\\n It was beautifully made, and had a\\n sort of professional look about it.\\n\\n\\n \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.\\n \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree\\n sometimes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let\\'s\\n see it.\" She gave the wire at the small\\n end the slightest of twists. \"There, it\\n ought to swoop.\"\\n\\n\\n Sure enough, in the moderate\\n breeze of that morning, the kite\\n swooped and yawed to Mary\\'s entire\\n satisfaction. As we trailed back to the\\n barn I asked Doris, \"How did you\\n know that flattening the lower edge\\n of the hole would create instability?\"\\n She looked doubtful.\\n\\n\\n \"Why it would have to, wouldn\\'t\\n it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"\\n She glanced at me quickly.\\n \"Of course, I tried a lot of different\\n shapes while I was making it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at\\n that. \"Where\\'s Tommy?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete\\n Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.\\n We\\'ll want to buy materials to\\n make some of these kites.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack\\n and I were going to advance\\n some cash to get started.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, but don\\'t you think it\\n would be better to borrow from a\\n bank? More businesslike?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally\\n want some security.\" I would\\n have gone on and explained matters\\n further, except that Tommy walked\\n in and handed me a pocket check\\n book.\\n\\n\\n \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he\\n volunteered—not without a hint of\\n complacency in his voice. \"It didn\\'t\\n take long, but they sure made it out\\n a big deal. Half the guys in the bank\\n had to be called in to listen to the\\n proposition. The account\\'s in your\\n name, Mr. Henderson, and you\\'ll have\\n to make out the checks. And they\\n want you to stop in at the bank and\\n give them a specimen signature. Oh,\\n yes, and cosign the note.\"\\n\\n\\n My heart sank. I\\'d never had any\\n dealings with banks except in the\\n matter of mortgages, and bank people\\n make me most uneasy. To say\\n nothing of finding myself responsible\\n for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar\\n note—over two weeks salary. I made\\n a mental vow to sign very few checks.\\n\\n\\n \"So then I stopped by at Apex\\n Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered\\n some paper and envelopes. We\\n hadn\\'t picked a name yesterday, but I\\n figured what\\'s to lose, and picked one.\\n Ridge Industries, how\\'s that?\" Everybody\\n nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"\\n he explained. \"Ridge Industries—Ridgeville—Montana.\"\\n\\n\\n I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,\\n I trust.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can\\'t\\n afford to look chintzy.\"\\nMy appetite was not at its best\\n that evening, and Marjorie recognized\\n that something was concerning\\n me, but she asked no questions, and\\n I only told her about the success of\\n the kite, and the youngsters embarking\\n on a shopping trip for paper, glue\\n and wood splints. There was no use\\n in both of us worrying.\\n\\n\\n On Friday we all got down to work,\\n and presently had a regular production\\n line under way; stapling the\\n wood splints, then wetting them with\\n a resin solution and shaping them\\n over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the\\n plastic film around a pattern, assembling\\n and hanging the finished kites\\n from an overhead beam until the cement\\n had set. Pete Cope had located\\n a big roll of red plastic film from\\n somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking\\n kite. Happily, I didn\\'t know\\n what the film cost until the first kites\\n were sold.\\n\\n\\n By Wednesday of the following\\n week we had almost three hundred\\n kites finished and packed into flat\\n cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn\\'t\\n care if I never saw another. Tommy,\\n who by mutual consent, was our\\n authority on sales, didn\\'t want to sell\\n any until we had, as he put it, enough\\n to meet the demand, but this quantity\\n seemed to satisfy him. He said he\\n would sell them the next week and\\n Mary McCready, with a fine burst of\\n confidence, asked him in all seriousness\\n to be sure to hold out a dozen.\\n\\n\\n Three other things occurred that\\n day, two of which I knew about immediately.\\n Mary brought a portable\\n typewriter from home and spent part\\n of the afternoon banging away at\\n what seemed to me, since I use two\\n fingers only, a very creditable speed.\\n\\n\\n And Hilary brought in a bottle of\\n his new detergent. It was a syrupy\\n yellow liquid with a nice collar of\\n suds. He\\'d been busy in his home\\n laboratory after all, it seemed.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never\\n told us.\"\\n\\n\\n Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl\\n phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in\\n 20% solution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it\\'s been\\n twenty-five years since my last course\\n in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the\\n formula—.\"\\n\\n\\n He gave me a singularly adult\\n smile and jotted down a scrawl of\\n symbols and lines. It meant little to\\n me.\\n\\n\\n \"Is it good?\"\\n\\n\\n For answer he seized the ice bucket,\\n now empty of its soda bottles,\\n trickled in a few drops from the bottle\\n and swished the contents. Foam\\n mounted to the rim and spilled over.\\n \"And that\\'s our best grade of Ridgeville\\n water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest\\n in the country.\"\\n\\n\\n The third event of Wednesday\\n came to my ears on Thursday morning.\\n\\n\\n I was a little late arriving at the\\n barn, and was taken a bit aback to\\n find the roadway leading to it rather\\n full of parked automobiles, and the\\n barn itself rather full of people, including\\n two policemen. Our Ridgeville\\n police are quite young men, but\\n in uniform they still look ominous\\n and I was relieved to see that they\\n were laughing and evidently enjoying\\n themselves.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my\\n best classroom voice. \"What is all\\n this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger\\n policeman asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash\\n bulb went off. A young lady grasped\\n my arm.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come\\n outside where it\\'s quieter and tell me\\n all about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody\\n should tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean you don\\'t know, honestly?\\n Oh, it\\'s fabulous. Best story I\\'ve\\n had for ages. It\\'ll make the city papers.\"\\n She led me around the corner\\n of the barn to a spot of comparative\\n quiet.\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t know that one of your\\n junior whatsisnames poured detergent\\n in the Memorial Fountain basin\\n last night?\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head numbly.\\n\\n\\n \"It was priceless. Just before rush\\n hour. Suds built up in the basin and\\n overflowed, and down the library\\n steps and covered the whole street.\\n And the funniest part was they kept\\n right on coming. You couldn\\'t imagine\\n so much suds coming from that\\n little pool of water. There was a\\n three-block traffic jam and Harry got\\n us some marvelous pictures—men\\n rolling up their trousers to wade\\n across the street. And this morning,\"\\n she chortled, \"somebody phoned in\\n an anonymous tip to the police—of\\n course it was the same boy that did\\n it—Tommy—Miller?—and so here\\n we are. And we just saw a demonstration\\n of that fabulous kite and saw\\n all those simply captivating mice.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mice?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. Who would ever\\n have thought you could breed mice\\n with those cute furry tails?\"\\nWell, after a while things quieted\\n down. They had to. The police left\\n after sobering up long enough to\\n give me a serious warning against\\n letting such a thing happen again.\\n Mr. Miller, who had come home to\\n see what all the excitement was, went\\n back to work and Mrs. Miller went\\n back to the house and the reporter\\n and photographer drifted off to file\\n their story, or whatever it is they do.\\n Tommy was jubilant.\\n\\n\\n \"Did you hear what she said? It\\'ll\\n make the city papers. I wish we had\\n a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh\\n boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can\\n you make some more of that stuff?\\n And Doris, how many mice do you\\n have?\"\\n\\n\\n Those mice! I have always kept\\n my enthusiasm for rodents within\\n bounds, but I must admit they were\\n charming little beasts, with tails as\\n bushy as miniature squirrels.\\n\\n\\n \"How many generations?\" I asked\\n Doris.\\n\\n\\n \"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.\\n Want to see the genetic charts?\"\\n\\n\\n I won\\'t try to explain it as she did\\n to me, but it was quite evident that\\n the new mice were breeding true.\\n Presently we asked Betty Miller to\\n come back down to the barn for a\\n conference. She listened and asked\\n questions. At last she said, \"Well, all\\n right, if you promise me they can\\'t\\n get out of their cages. But heaven\\n knows what you\\'ll do when fall\\n comes. They won\\'t live in an unheated\\n barn and you can\\'t bring them\\n into the house.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll be out of the mouse business\\n by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet\\n shop in the country will have\\n them and they\\'ll be down to nothing\\n apiece.\"\\n\\n\\n Doris was right, of course, in spite\\n of our efforts to protect the market.\\n Anyhow that ushered in our cage\\n building phase, and for the next\\n week—with a few interruptions—we\\n built cages, hundreds of them, a good\\n many for breeding, but mostly for\\n shipping.\\n\\n\\n It was rather regrettable that, after\\n the\\nCourier\\ngave us most of the third\\n page, including photographs, we rarely\\n had a day without a few visitors.\\n Many of them wanted to buy mice or\\n kites, but Tommy refused to sell any\\n mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint\\n those who wanted kites. The\\n Supermarket took all we had—except\\n a dozen—and at a dollar fifty\\n each. Tommy\\'s ideas of pricing rather\\n frightened me, but he set the value\\n of the mice at ten dollars a pair\\n and got it without any arguments.\\n\\n\\n Our beautiful stationery arrived,\\n and we had some invoice forms printed\\n up in a hurry—not engraved, for\\n a wonder.\\n\\n\\n It was on Tuesday—following the\\n Thursday—that a lanky young man\\n disentangled himself from his car\\n and strolled into the barn. I looked\\n up from the floor where I was tacking\\n squares of screening onto wooden\\n frames.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"You\\'re Donald\\n Henderson, right? My name is McCord—Jeff\\n McCord—and I work in\\n the Patent Section at the Commission\\'s\\n downtown office. My boss sent\\n me over here, but if he hadn\\'t, I\\n think I\\'d have come anyway. What\\n are you doing to get patent protection\\n on Ridge Industries\\' new developments?\"\\n\\n\\n I got my back unkinked and dusted\\n off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,\\n \"I\\'ve been wondering whether something\\n shouldn\\'t be done, but I know\\n very little about such matters—.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed\\n that might be the case, and there are\\n three patent men in our office who\\'d\\n like to chip in and contribute some\\n time. Partly for the kicks and partly\\n because we think you may have some\\n things worth protecting. How about\\n it? You worry about the filing and\\n final fees. That\\'s sixty bucks per\\n brainstorm. We\\'ll worry about everything\\n else.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\\n\\n\\n And so we acquired a patent attorney,\\n several of them, in fact.\\n\\n\\n The day that our application on\\n the kite design went to Washington,\\n Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers\\n scattered from New York to Los\\n Angeles, sent a kite to each one and\\n offered to license the design. Result,\\n one licensee with a thousand dollar\\n advance against next season\\'s royalties.\\nIt was a rainy morning about three\\n weeks later that I arrived at the barn.\\n Jeff McCord was there, and the whole\\n team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his\\n feet from the picnic table and said,\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You\\n look pleased.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious\\n legal sense, of course. Hilary and I\\n were just going over the situation on\\n his phosphonate detergent. I\\'ve spent\\n the last three nights studying the patent\\n literature and a few standard\\n texts touching on phosphonates.\\n There are a zillion patents on synthetic\\n detergents and a good round\\n fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"—he\\n held up a long admonitory hand—\"it\\n just looks as though we had a clear\\n spot. If we do get protection, you\\'ve\\n got a real salable property.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary\\n said, \"but it\\'s not very important.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow\\n at me, and I handed him a small\\n bottle. He opened and sniffed at it\\n gingerly. \"What gives?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told\\n him. \"You\\'ve shaved this morning,\\n but try some anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n Jeff looked momentarily dubious,\\n then puddled some in his palm and\\n moistened his jaw line. \"Smells\\n good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and\\n cool. Now what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a\\n handkerchief and wiped, looked at\\n the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each\\n hair brittle enough to break off right\\n at the surface of your skin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook\\n chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone\\n and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And\\n do your whiskers grow back the next\\n day?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n McCord unfolded his length and\\n stood staring out into the rain. Presently\\n he said, \"Henderson, Hilary\\n and I are heading for my office. We\\n can work there better than here, and\\n if we\\'re going to break the hearts of\\n the razor industry, there\\'s no better\\n time to start than now.\"\\n\\n\\n When they had driven off I turned\\n and said, \"Let\\'s talk a while. We can\\n always clean mouse cages later.\\n Where\\'s Tommy?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get\\n a loan.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What on earth for? We have over\\n six thousand in the account.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little\\n embarrassed, \"we were planning to\\n buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris\\n put some embroidery on that scheme\\n of mine for making ball bearings.\"\\n He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,\\n we make a roller bearing, this shape\\n only it\\'s a permanent magnet. Then\\n you see—.\" And he was off.\\n\\n\\n \"What did they do today, dear?\"\\n Marge asked as she refilled my coffee\\n cup.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let\\'s see, it was\\n a big day. We picked out a hydraulic\\n press, Doris read us the first chapter\\n of the book she\\'s starting, and we\\n found a place over a garage on\\n Fourth Street that we can rent for\\n winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is\\n starting action to get the company\\n incorporated.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.\\n \"You mean you\\'re going to try to\\n keep the group going after school\\n starts?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not? The kids can sail\\n through their courses without thinking\\n about them, and actually they\\n won\\'t put in more than a few hours\\n a week during the school year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Even so, it\\'s child labor, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Child labor nothing. They\\'re the\\n employers. Jeff McCord and I will\\n be the only employees—just at first,\\n anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n Marge choked on something. \"Did\\n you say you\\'d be an employee?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They\\'ve offered\\n me a small share of the company,\\n and I\\'d be crazy to turn it down. After\\n all, what\\'s to lose?\"\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAnalog Science Fact &amp; Fiction\\nJuly 1962.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

KASTLE\\nIllustrated by von Dongen\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\\n on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be\\n welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a\\n hero...?\\nThere was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual\\n speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had\\n once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had\\n since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything\\n wasn\\'t usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn\\'t seem quite as\\n at-ease as he\\'d been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer,\\n one of the crew of the spaceship\\nWashington\\n, first to set Americans\\n upon Mars. His Honor\\'s handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His\\n Honor\\'s eyes held a trace of remoteness.\\n\\n\\n Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the\\n hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal\\n tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat\\n between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,\\n and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National\\n Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of\\n the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their\\n parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous\\n national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them\\n come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as\\n they\\'d adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the\\n newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the\\n Galloping Twenties.\\n\\n\\n He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man\\n and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than\\n any man who\\'d ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a\\n kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old\\n friends and a relative or two. He didn\\'t want to talk about the journey.\\n He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps\\n he would talk.\\n\\n\\n Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had\\n returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great\\n mariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing,\\n passing, and then the arrival.\\n\\n\\n The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him\\n off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.\\n They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,\\n almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had\\n wanted it to be as before.\\n\\n\\n The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had\\n escorted him on this trip from the square, didn\\'t ask to go in with him.\\n He was glad. He\\'d had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with\\n strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing\\n beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,\\n their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was\\n still too much the First One to have his gaze met.\\n\\n\\n He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate\\n flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental\\n knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was\\n surprised that he\\'d had to do this. He\\'d thought Edith would be watching\\n at a window.\\n\\n\\n And perhaps she\\nhad\\nbeen watching ... but she hadn\\'t opened the door.\\n\\n\\n The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn\\'t been too long and she\\n hadn\\'t changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he\\'d loved\\n in high school, the small, slender woman he\\'d married twelve years ago.\\n Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual\\n support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They\\n looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,\\n \"It\\'s good to be home!\"\\n\\n\\n Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other\\n arm around him. He kissed her—her neck, her cheek—and all the old\\n jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the\\n and-\\nthen\\n-I\\'ll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.\\n She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the\\n difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to\\n Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could\\n think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\\n\\n\\n Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the\\n floor, and he didn\\'t look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I\\n didn\\'t grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don\\'t eat enough.\"\\n\\n\\n So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that\\n everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General\\n Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left\\n Washington.\\n\\n\\n \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need\\n the time. And for the love of heaven, don\\'t be sensitive.\"\\nEdith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,\\n a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat\\n down beside him—but she had hesitated. He\\nwasn\\'t\\nbeing sensitive; she\\n had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\\n\\n\\n Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus\\', to Vasco De\\n Gama\\'s, to Preshoff\\'s when the Russian returned from the Moon—but more\\n so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked\\n with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic\\n journey—even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius\\n in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.\\nThe eyes. It always showed in their eyes.\\nHe looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy\\n already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of\\n feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself\\n twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie\\'s face was drawn, was worried in a\\n way that few ten-year-old faces are.\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'s it going in school?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Gee, Dad, it\\'s the second month of summer vacation.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pretty good.\"\\n\\n\\n Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and\\n he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the\\n warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie\\'s farewell, their tears as\\n he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had\\n feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in\\n continent-to-continent experimental flight.\\n\\n\\n They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.\\n But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the\\n long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt\\n and the others I\\'d pitch. It\\'s Inter-Town Little League, you know. It\\'s\\n Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,\\n he waved his hand—it shook; a ten-year-old boy\\'s hand that shook—and\\n ran from the room and from the house.\\n\\n\\n He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in\\n his arms, and yet he didn\\'t want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I\\'m very\\n tired. I\\'d like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn\\'t true, because he\\'d\\n been lying down all the months of the way back.\\n\\n\\n She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and\\n make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\\n\\n\\n He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do—make small talk\\n and pick up just where he\\'d left off. But they didn\\'t expect it of him;\\n they wouldn\\'t let him; they felt he had changed too much.\\nShe led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie\\'s room and past\\n the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was\\n newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an\\n ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more\\n ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire\\n fence around the experimental station.\\n\\n\\n \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\\n\\n\\n She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the\\n fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you\\n to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.\\n You always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you\\n were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it\\n to this bed again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\\n\\n\\n \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom\\n set and I really didn\\'t know—\" She waved her hand, her face white.\\n\\n\\n He was sure then that she\\nhad\\nknown, and that the beds and the barrier\\n between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went\\n to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,\\n began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars\\n still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\\n\\n\\n She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\\n\\n\\n He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite\\n wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the\\n scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing\\n diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.\\n There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They\\'d\\n been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen\\n them.\\n\\n\\n Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would\\n keep them from her until they were gone.\\n\\n\\n Which was not what he\\'d considered at all important on leaving Walter\\n Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found\\n distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,\\n he began to understand that there would be many things, previously\\n beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;\\n Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably\\n changed—because they thought\\nhe\\nhad changed.\\n\\n\\n He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let\\n himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known\\n before.\\n\\n\\n But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began\\n filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same\\n man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and\\n friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could\\n communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One\\n would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a\\n return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash\\n instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be\\n granted to him.\\n\\n\\n He slept.\\nDinner was at seven\\n p.m.\\n His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille\\n came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate\\n in the dining room at the big table.\\n\\n\\n Before he\\'d become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His\\n family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of\\n talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with\\n company present—to describe everything and anything that had happened\\n to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially\\n with his mother, though they didn\\'t agree about much. Still, it had been\\n good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\\n\\n\\n This wasn\\'t good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn\\'t sure. \"Stiff\"\\n was perhaps the word.\\n\\n\\n They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,\\n efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked\\n at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,\\n \"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he\\'d said it many many times\\n before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip\\n something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time\\n she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was\\n the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort\\n her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\\n\\n\\n He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched\\n her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn\\'t move\\n it—she hadn\\'t touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool\\n embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it\\n drop out of sight.\\n\\n\\n So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,\\n the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\\n\\n\\n The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe\\n began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform\\n houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman\\'s voice.\\n \"Still going like sixty. We\\'ll sell out before—\" At that point he\\n looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in\\n this normalcy, and Joe\\'s voice died away. He looked down at his plate,\\n mumbled, \"Soup\\'s getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a\\n little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\\n\\n\\n Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies\\' Tuesday\\n Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between\\n Joe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt\\n alone—and said, \"I\\'ve missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose\\n bushes. Here it is August and I haven\\'t had my hand to a mower or\\n trowel.\"\\n\\n\\n Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of\\n the lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,\\n and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I\\n have a dismal headache. I\\'m going to lie down in the guest room a\\n while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing—his affectionate, effusive\\n mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often\\n irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses—she barely\\n touched his shoulder and fled.\\n\\n\\n So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served—thin, rare\\n slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He\\n cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie\\n and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"\\n Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and\\n murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said\\n Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going\\n into the living room for a while. \"She\\'ll be back for dessert, of\\n course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\\n\\n\\n Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at\\n Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was\\n chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at\\n Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\\n\\n\\n He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass\\n overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They\\n were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big\\n right fist—Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a\\n scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the\\n First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear\\n of, that he could have smashed more than a table.\\n\\n\\n Edith said, \"Hank!\"\\n\\n\\n He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I\\'m sick of\\n the lot of you.\"\\nMother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food\\n down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear—\" He didn\\'t answer. She began\\n to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said\\n anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been\\n the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about\\n getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"\\n and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\\n\\n\\n He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special\\n dessert she\\'d been preparing half the day—a magnificent English trifle.\\n She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She\\n hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the\\n boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the\\n table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,\\n \"Hey, I promised—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You promised the boys you\\'d play baseball or football or handball or\\n something; anything to get away from your father.\"\\n\\n\\n Ralphie\\'s head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\\n\\n\\n Edith said, \"He\\'ll stay home, Hank. We\\'ll spend an evening\\n together—talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\\n\\n\\n Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\\n\\n\\n Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I\\n want to. The question is whether\\nyou\\nwant to.\"\\n\\n\\n They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their\\n eyes—his wife\\'s and son\\'s eyes—could not meet his, and so he said he\\n was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in\\n all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that\\n they shouldn\\'t count on him for normal social life.\\n\\n\\n He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\\n\\n\\n But he didn\\'t sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a\\n lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,\\n and it seemed her old smile. \"They\\'re so anxious to see you, Hank. I\\n could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want\\n to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\\n\\n\\n He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They\\'d had wonderful\\n times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and\\n closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\\n\\n\\n Do the town? They\\'d paint it and then tear it down!\\nIt didn\\'t turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he\\'d\\n also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to\\n expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded\\n very much the way he always had—soft spoken and full of laughter and\\n full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and\\n clapped Hank on the shoulder \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mbut not the way he always had—so much\\n more gently, almost remotely\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, and insisted they all drink more than was\\n good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along\\n on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\\n\\n\\n They didn\\'t bowl very long. At ten o\\'clock they crossed the road to\\n Manfred\\'s Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee\\n and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he\\n merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\\n\\n\\n There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred\\'s Tavern. He\\'d been there\\n many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized\\n him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as\\n if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\\n\\n\\n At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he\\n said, \"I haven\\'t danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his\\n mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her\\n face—pretty Rhona, who\\'d always flirted with him, who\\'d made a ritual\\n of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going\\n to be sick.\\n\\n\\n \"So let\\'s rock,\" he said and stood up.\\n\\n\\n They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.\\n And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,\\n mechanical dancing doll.\\n\\n\\n The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,\\n \"Beddy-bye time.\"\\n\\n\\n Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\\n\\n\\n He and Edith danced. He didn\\'t hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited\\n for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn\\'t.\\n Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her\\n face—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know\\n she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when\\n the music ended, he was ready to go home.\\n\\n\\n They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of\\n Phil\\'s car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,\\n Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old\\n self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with\\n the First One.\\n\\n\\n They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and\\n Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and\\n looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence\\n paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that\\'s\\n the most popular place on earth?\"\\n\\n\\n Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a\\n little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a\\n while longer, not yet aware of his supposed\\nfaux pas\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter\\n rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\\n\\n\\n Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—\"\\n\\n\\n Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\\n\\n\\n Phil said, \"Because people are—\" And then he caught himself and waved\\n his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the\\n window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting\\n tombstones.\\n\\n\\n The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been\\n nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should\\n let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I\\'m home—or that\\'s what everyone\\n seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that\\n would satisfy people. Maybe that\\'s the only way to act, like Dracula or\\n another monster from the movies.\"\\n\\n\\n Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don\\'t, don\\'t!\"\\n\\n\\n The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four\\n blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn\\'t bother saying good night. He\\n didn\\'t wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path\\n and entered the house.\\n\"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I\\'m so sorry—\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s nothing to be sorry about. It\\'s just a matter of time. It\\'ll\\n all work out in time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that\\'s it. I need a little time. We all need a\\n little time. Because it\\'s so strange, Hank. Because it\\'s so frightening.\\n I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I\\'ve hurt\\n you terribly, we\\'ve all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we\\'re\\n frightened.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as\\n necessary. For good if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\\n\\n\\n That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he\\'d had since\\n returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,\\n even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\\n\\n\\n \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right\\n now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I\\n did—seven months ago next Wednesday—he\\'s going to be next. He was\\n smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he\\'s almost\\n ready. And there\\'ll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save\\n all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man\\n loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,\\n he\\'ll go into the tanks and they\\'ll start the regenerative brain and\\n organ process—the process that made it all possible. So people have to\\n get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old\\n superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of\\n us; because in time it\\'ll be an ordinary thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Edith said, \"Yes, and I\\'m so grateful that you\\'re here, Hank. Please\\n believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—\" She paused.\\n \"There\\'s one question.\"\\n\\n\\n He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by\\n everyone from the president of the United States on down.\\n\\n\\n \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half\\n months—slept without dreaming.\"\\n\\n\\n She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was\\n satisfied.\\n\\n\\n Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of\\n how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and\\n pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own\\n home.\\nTHE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Like the\\n decision \"I\\'ve had enough!\"\\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\\nRead locked the door and drew his pistol. Sergeant Rashid handed\\n Premier Umluana the warrant.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re from the UN Inspector Corps,\" Sergeant Rashid said. \"I\\'m\\n very sorry, but we have to arrest you and bring you in for trial\\n by the World Court.\"\\n\\n\\n If Umluana noticed Read\\'s gun, he didn\\'t show it. He read the\\n warrant carefully. When he finished, he said something in Dutch.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know your language,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n \"Then I\\'ll speak English.\" Umluana was a small man with wrinkled\\n brow, glasses and a mustache. His skin was a shade lighter than\\n Read\\'s. \"The Inspector General doesn\\'t have the power to arrest a\\n head of state—especially the Premier of Belderkan. Now, if\\n you\\'ll excuse me, I must return to my party.\"\\n\\n\\n In the other room people laughed and talked. Glasses clinked in\\n the late afternoon. Read knew two armed men stood just outside\\n the door. \"If you leave, Premier, I\\'ll have to shoot you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think so,\" Umluana said. \"No, if you kill me, all Africa\\n will rise against the world. You don\\'t want me dead. You want me\\n in court.\"\\n\\n\\n Read clicked off the safety.\\n\\n\\n \"Corporal Read is very young,\" Rashid said, \"but he\\'s a crack\\n shot. That\\'s why I brought him with me. I think he\\nlikes\\nto\\n shoot, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Umluana turned back to Rashid a second too soon. He saw the\\n sergeant\\'s upraised hand before it collided with his neck.\\n\\n\\n \"Help!\\nKidnap.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid judo chopped him and swung the inert body over his\\n shoulders. Read pulled a flat grenade from his vest pocket. He\\n dropped it and yellow psycho gas hissed from the valve.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s be off,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n The door lock snapped as they went out the window. Two men with\\n rifles plunged into the gas; sighing, they fell to the floor in a\\n catatonic trance.\\n\\n\\n A little car skimmed across the lawn. Bearing the Scourge of\\n Africa, Rashid struggled toward it. Read walked backward,\\n covering their retreat.\\n\\n\\n The car stopped, whirling blades holding it a few inches off the\\n lawn. They climbed in.\\n\\n\\n \"How did it go?\" The driver and another inspector occupied the\\n front seat.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll be after us in half a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n The other inspector carried a light machine gun and a box of\\n grenades. \"I better cover,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n The inspector slid out of the car and ran to a clump of bushes.\\n The driver pushed in the accelerator. As they swerved toward the\\n south, Read saw a dozen armed men run out of the house. A grenade\\n arced from the bushes and the pursuers recoiled from the cloud\\n that rose before them.\\n\\n\\n \"Is he all right?\" the driver asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think I hurt him.\" Rashid took a syrette from his vest\\n pocket. \"Well, Read, it looks like we\\'re in for a fight. In a few\\n minutes Miaka Station will know we\\'re coming. And God knows what\\n will happen at the Game Preserve.\"\\n\\n\\n Read wanted to jump out of the car. He could die any minute. But\\n he had set his life on a well-oiled track and he couldn\\'t get off\\n until they reached Geneva.\\n\\n\\n \"They don\\'t know who\\'s coming,\" he said. \"They don\\'t make them\\n tough enough to stop this boy.\"\\n\\n\\n Staring straight ahead, he didn\\'t see the sergeant smile.\\nTwo types of recruits are accepted by the UN Inspector Corps:\\n those with a fanatic loyalty to the ideals of peace and world\\n order, and those who are loyal to nothing but themselves. Read\\n was the second type.\\n\\n\\n A tall, lanky Negro he had spent his school days in one of the\\n drab suburbs that ring every prosperous American city. It was the\\n home of factory workers, clerks, semiskilled technicians, all who\\n do the drudge work of civilization and know they will never do\\n more. The adults spent their days with television, alcohol and\\n drugs; the young spent their days with gangs, sex, television and\\n alcohol. What else was there? Those who could have told him\\n neither studied nor taught at his schools. What he saw on the\\n concrete fields between the tall apartment houses marked the\\n limits of life\\'s possibilities.\\n\\n\\n He had belonged to a gang called The Golden Spacemen. \"Nobody\\n fools with me,\" he bragged. \"When Harry Read\\'s out, there\\'s a\\n tiger running loose.\" No one knew how many times he nearly ran\\n from other clubs, how carefully he picked the safest spot on the\\n battle line.\\n\\n\\n \"A man ought to be a man,\" he once told a girl. \"He ought to do a\\n man\\'s work. Did you ever notice how our fathers look, how they\\n sleep so much? I don\\'t want to be like that. I want to be\\n something proud.\"\\n\\n\\n He joined the UN Inspector Corps at eighteen, in 1978. The\\n international cops wore green berets, high buttonless boots, bush\\n jackets. They were very special men.\\n\\n\\n For the first time in his life, his father said something about\\n his ambitions.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you like America, Harry? Do you\\nwant\\nto be without a\\n country? This is the best country in the world. All my life I\\'ve\\n made a good living. Haven\\'t you had everything you ever wanted?\\n I\\'ve been a king compared to people overseas. Why, you stay here\\n and go to trade school and in two years you\\'ll be living just\\n like me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t want that,\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, you don\\'t want that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You could join the American Army,\" his mother said. \"That\\'s as\\n good as a trade school. If you have to be a soldier.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I want to be a UN man. I\\'ve already enlisted. I\\'m in! What do\\n you care what I do?\"\\n\\n\\n The UN Inspector Corps had been founded to enforce the Nuclear\\n Disarmament Treaty of 1966. Through the years it had acquired\\n other jobs. UN men no longer went unarmed. Trained to use small\\n arms and gas weapons, they guarded certain borders, bodyguarded\\n diplomats and UN officials, even put down riots that threatened\\n international peace. As the UN evolved into a strong world\\n government, the UN Inspector Corps steadily acquired new powers.\\n\\n\\n Read went through six months training on Madagascar.\\n\\n\\n Twice he nearly got expelled for picking fights with smaller men.\\n Rather than resign, he accepted punishment which assigned him to\\n weeks of dull, filthy extra labor. He hated the restrictions and\\n the iron fence of regulations. He hated boredom, loneliness and\\n isolation.\\n\\n\\n And yet he responded with enthusiasm. They had given him a job. A\\n job many people considered important.\\n\\n\\n He took his turn guarding the still disputed borders of Korea. He\\n served on the rescue teams that patrol the busy Polar routes. He\\n mounted guard at the 1980 World\\'s Fair in Rangoon.\\n\\n\\n \"I liked Rangoon,\" he even told a friend. \"I even liked Korea.\\n But I think I liked the Pole job best. You sit around playing\\n cards and shooting the bull and then there\\'s a plane crash or\\n something and you go out and win a medal. That\\'s great for me.\\n I\\'m lazy and I like excitement.\"\\nOne power implied in the UN Charter no Secretary General or\\n Inspector General had ever tried to use. The power to arrest any\\n head of state whose country violated international law. Could the\\n World Court try and imprison a politician who had conspired to\\n attack another nation?\\n\\n\\n For years Africa had been called \"The South America of the Old\\n World.\" Revolution followed revolution. Colonies became\\n democracies. Democracies became dictatorships or dissolved in\\n civil war. Men planted bases on the moon and in four years,\\n 1978-82, ringed the world with matter transmitters; but the black\\n population of Africa still struggled toward political equality.\\n\\n\\n Umluana took control of Belderkan in 1979. The tiny, former Dutch\\n colony, had been a tottering democracy for ten years. The very\\n day he took control the new dictator and his African party began\\n to build up the Belderkan Army. For years he had preached a new\\n Africa, united, free of white masters, the home of a vigorous and\\n perfect Negro society. His critics called him a hypocritical\\n racist, an opportunist using the desires of the African people to\\n build himself an empire.\\n\\n\\n He began a propaganda war against neighboring South Africa,\\n promising the liberation of that strife-torn land. Most Negro\\n leaders, having just won representation in the South African\\n Parliament, told him to liberate his own country. They believed\\n they could use their first small voice in the government to win\\n true freedom for their people.\\n\\n\\n But the radio assault and the arms buildup continued. Early in\\n 1982, South Africa claimed the Belderkan Army exceeded the size\\n agreed to in the Disarmament Treaty. The European countries and\\n some African nations joined in the accusation. China called the\\n uproar a vicious slur on a new African nation. The United States\\n and Russia, trying not to get entangled, asked for more\\n investigation by the UN.\\n\\n\\n But the evidence was clear. Umluana was defying world law. If he\\n got away with it, some larger and more dangerous nation might\\n follow his precedent. And the arms race would begin again.\\n\\n\\n The Inspector General decided. They would enter Belderkan, arrest\\n Umluana and try him by due process before the World Court. If the\\n plan succeeded, mankind would be a long step farther from nuclear\\n war.\\n\\n\\n Read didn\\'t know much about the complicated political reasons for\\n the arrest. He liked the Corp and he liked being in the Corp. He\\n went where they sent him and did what they told him to do.\\nThe car skimmed above the tree-tops. The driver and his two\\n passengers scanned the sky.\\n\\n\\n A plane would have been a faster way to get out of the country.\\n But then they would have spent hours flying over Africa, with\\n Belderkan fighters in hot pursuit, other nations joining the\\n chase and the world uproar gaining volume. By transmitter, if all\\n went well, they could have Umluana in Geneva in an hour.\\n\\n\\n They were racing toward Miaka, a branch transmitter station. From\\n Miaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous\\n tourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on\\n the globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game\\n Preserve station and manning its controls.\\n\\n\\n They had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get\\n there before it could be defended.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s no military base near Miaka,\" Rashid said. \"We might get\\n there before the Belderkans.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Here comes our escort,\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n A big car rose from the jungle. This one had a recoilless rifle\\n mounted on the roof. The driver and the gunner waved and fell in\\n behind them.\\n\\n\\n \"One thing,\" Read said, \"I don\\'t think they\\'ll shoot at us while\\nhe\\'s\\nin the car.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be certain, corporal. All these strong-arm movements are\\n alike. I\\'ll bet Umluana\\'s lieutenants are hoping he\\'ll become a\\n dead legend. Then they can become live conquerors.\"\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid came from Cairo. He had degrees in science and\\n history from Cambridge but only the Corp gave him work that\\n satisfied his conscience. He hated war. It was that simple.\\n\\n\\n Read looked back. He saw three spots of sunlight about two\\n hundred feet up and a good mile behind.\\n\\n\\n \"Here they come, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid turned his head. He waved frantically. The two men in the\\n other car waved back.\\n\\n\\n \"Shall I duck under the trees?\" the driver asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not yet. Not until we have to.\"\\n\\n\\n Read fingered the machine gun he had picked up when he got in the\\n car. He had never been shot at. Twice he had faced an unarmed\\n mob, but a few shots had sent them running.\\n\\n\\n Birds flew screaming from their nests. Monkeys screeched and\\n threw things at the noisy, speeding cars. A little cloud of birds\\n surrounded each vehicle.\\n\\n\\n The escort car made a sharp turn and charged their pursuers. The\\n big rifle fired twice. Read saw the Belderkan cars scatter.\\n Suddenly machine-gun bullets cracked and whined beside him.\\n\\n\\n \"Evade,\" Rashid said. \"Don\\'t go down.\"\\n\\n\\n Without losing any forward speed, the driver took them straight\\n up. Read\\'s stomach bounced.\\n\\n\\n A shell exploded above them. The car rocked. He raised his eyes\\n and saw a long crack in the roof.\\n\\n\\n \"Hit the floor,\" Rashid said.\\n\\n\\n They knelt on the cramped floor. Rashid put on his gas mask and\\n Read copied him. Umluana breathed like a furnace, still\\n unconscious from the injection Rashid had given him.\\nI can\\'t do anything\\n, Read thought.\\nThey\\'re too far away to\\n shoot back. All we can do is run.\\nThe sky was clear and blue. The jungle was a noisy bazaar of\\n color. In the distance guns crashed. He listened to shells\\n whistle by and the whipcrack of machine-gun bullets. The car\\n roller-coastered up and down. Every time a shell passed, he\\n crawled in waves down his own back.\\n\\n\\n Another explosion, this time very loud.\\n\\n\\n Rashid raised his eyes above the seat and looked out the rear\\n window. \"Two left. Keep down, Read.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t we go down?\" Read said.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll get to Miaka before us.\"\\n\\n\\n He shut his eyes when he heard another loud explosion.\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid looked out the window again. He swore bitterly in\\n English and Egyptian. Read raised his head. The two cars behind\\n them weren\\'t fighting each other. A long way back the tree-tops\\n burned.\\n\\n\\n \"How much farther?\" Rashid said. The masks muffled their voices.\\n\\n\\n \"There it is now. Shall I take us right in?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I think you\\'d better.\"\\nThe station was a glass diamond in a small clearing. The driver\\n slowed down, then crashed through the glass walls and hovered by\\n the transmitter booth.\\n\\n\\n Rashid opened the door and threw out two grenades. Read jumped\\n out and the two of them struggled toward the booth with Umluana.\\n The driver, pistol in hand, ran for the control panel.\\n\\n\\n There were three technicians in the station and no passengers.\\n All three panicked when the psycho gas enveloped them. They ran\\n howling for the jungle.\\n\\n\\n Through the window of his mask, Read saw their pursuers land in\\n the clearing. Machine-gun bullets raked the building. They got\\n Umluana in the booth and hit the floor. Read took aim and opened\\n fire on the largest car.\\n\\n\\n \"Now, I can shoot back,\" he said. \"Now we\\'ll see what they do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you ready, Rashid?\" yelled the driver.\\n\\n\\n \"Man, get us out of here!\"\\n\\n\\n The booth door shut. When it opened, they were at the Game\\n Preserve.\\n\\n\\n The station jutted from the side of a hill. A glass-walled\\n waiting room surrounded the bank of transmitter booths. Read\\n looked out the door and saw his first battlefield.\\n\\n\\n Directly in front of him, his head shattered by a bullet, a dead\\n inspector lay behind an overturned couch.\\n\\n\\n Read had seen dozens of training films taken during actual\\n battles or after atomic attacks. He had laughed when other\\n recruits complained. \"That\\'s the way this world is. You people\\n with the weak stomachs better get used to it.\"\\n\\n\\n Now he slid against the rear wall of the transmitter booth.\\n\\n\\n A wounded inspector crawled across the floor to the booth. Read\\n couldn\\'t see his wound, only the pain scratched on his face and\\n the blood he deposited on the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Did you get Umluana?\" he asked Sergeant Rashid.\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s in the booth. What\\'s going on?\" Rashid\\'s Middle East Oxford\\n seemed more clipped than ever.\\n\\n\\n \"They hit us with two companies of troops a few minutes ago. I\\n think half our men are wounded.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can we get out of here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They machine-gunned the controls.\"\\n\\n\\n Rashid swore. \"You heard him, Read! Get out there and help those\\n men.\"\\n\\n\\n He heard the screams of the wounded, the crack of rifles and\\n machine guns, all the terrifying noise of war. But since his\\n eighteenth year he had done everything his superiors told him to\\n do.\\n\\n\\n He started crawling toward an easy-chair that looked like good\\n cover. A bullet cracked above his head, so close he felt the\\n shock wave. He got up, ran panicky, crouched, and dove behind the\\n chair.\\n\\n\\n An inspector cracked the valve on a smoke grenade. A white fog\\n spread through the building. They could see anyone who tried to\\n rush them but the besiegers couldn\\'t pick out targets.\\n\\n\\n Above the noise, he heard Rashid.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m calling South Africa Station for a copter. It\\'s the only way\\n out of here. Until it comes, we\\'ve got to hold them back.\"\\n\\n\\n Read thought of the green beret he had stuffed in his pocket that\\n morning. He stuck it on his head and cocked it. He didn\\'t need\\n plain clothes anymore and he wanted to wear at least a part of\\n his uniform.\\n\\n\\n Bullets had completely shattered the wall in front of him. He\\n stared through the murk, across the broken glass. He was Corporal\\n Harry Read, UN Inspector Corps—a very special man. If he didn\\'t\\n do a good job here, he wasn\\'t the man he claimed to be. This\\n might be the only real test he would ever face.\\nHe heard a shout in rapid French. He turned to his right. Men in\\n red loincloths ran zigzagging toward the station. They carried\\n light automatic rifles. Half of them wore gas masks.\\n\\n\\n \"Shoot the masks,\" he yelled. \"Aim for the masks.\"\\n\\n\\n The machine gun kicked and chattered on his shoulder. He picked a\\n target and squeezed off a burst. Tensely, he hunted for another\\n mask. Three grenades arced through the air and yellow gas spread\\n across the battlefield. The attackers ran through it. A few yards\\n beyond the gas, some of them turned and ran for their own lines.\\n In a moment only half a dozen masked men still advanced. The\\n inspectors fired a long, noisy volley. When they stopped only\\n four attackers remained on their feet. And they were running for\\n cover.\\n\\n\\n The attackers had come straight up a road that led from the Game\\n Preserve to the station. They had not expected any resistance.\\n The UN men had already taken over the station, chased out the\\n passengers and technicians and taken up defense positions; they\\n had met the Belderkans with a dozen grenades and sent them\\n scurrying for cover. The fight so far had been vicious but\\n disorganized. But the Belderkans had a few hundred men and knew\\n they had wrecked the transmitter controls.\\n\\n\\n The first direct attack had been repulsed. They could attack many\\n more times and continue to spray the building with bullets. They\\n could also try to go around the hill and attack the station from\\n above; if they did, the inspectors had a good view of the hill\\n and should see them going up.\\n\\n\\n The inspectors had taken up good defensive positions. In spite of\\n their losses, they still had enough firepower to cover the area\\n surrounding the station.\\n\\n\\n Read surveyed his sector of fire. About two hundred yards to his\\n left, he saw the top of a small ditch. Using the ditch for cover,\\n the Belderkans could sneak to the top of the hill.\\n\\n\\n Gas grenades are only three inches long. They hold cubic yards of\\n gas under high pressure. Read unclipped a telescoping rod from\\n his vest pocket. He opened it and a pair of sights flipped up. A\\n thin track ran down one side.\\n\\n\\n He had about a dozen grenades left, three self-propelling. He\\n slid an SP grenade into the rod\\'s track and estimated windage and\\n range. Sighting carefully, not breathing, muscles relaxed, the\\n rod rock steady, he fired and lobbed the little grenade into the\\n ditch. He dropped another grenade beside it.\\n\\n\\n The heavy gas would lie there for hours.\\n\\n\\n Sergeant Rashid ran crouched from man to man. He did what he\\n could to shield the wounded.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, corporal, how are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not too bad, sergeant. See that ditch out there? I put a little\\n gas in it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good work. How\\'s your ammunition?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A dozen grenades. Half a barrel of shells.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The copter will be here in half an hour. We\\'ll put Umluana on,\\n then try to save ourselves. Once he\\'s gone, I think we ought to\\n surrender.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How do you think they\\'ll treat us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That we\\'ll have to see.\"\\n\\n\\n An occasional bullet cracked and whined through the misty room.\\n Near him a man gasped frantically for air. On the sunny field a\\n wounded man screamed for help.\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s a garage downstairs,\" Rashid said. \"In case the copter\\n doesn\\'t get here on time, I\\'ve got a man filling wine bottles\\n with gasoline.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll stop them, Sarge. Don\\'t worry.\"\\nRashid ran off. Read stared across the green land and listened to\\n the pound of his heart. What were the Belderkans planning? A mass\\n frontal attack? To sneak in over the top of the hill?\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t think, anymore than a rabbit thinks when it lies hiding\\n from the fox or a panther thinks when it crouches on a branch\\n above the trail. His skin tightened and relaxed on his body.\\n\\n\\n \"Listen,\" said a German.\\n\\n\\n Far down the hill he heard the deep-throated rumble of a big\\n motor.\\n\\n\\n \"Armor,\" the German said.\\n\\n\\n The earth shook. The tank rounded the bend. Read watched the\\n squat, angular monster until its stubby gun pointed at the\\n station. It stopped less than two hundred yards away.\\n\\n\\n A loud-speaker blared.\\n\\n\\n ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\\n\\n ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.\\n\\n YOU MAY THINK US SAVAGES\\n\\n BUT WE HAVE MODERN WEAPONS.\\n\\n WE HAVE ATOMIC WARHEADS,\\n\\n ALL GASES, ROCKETS\\n\\n AND FLAME THROWERS. IF\\n\\n YOU DO NOT SURRENDER\\n\\n OUR PREMIER, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.\\n\\n\\n\\n \"They know we don\\'t have any big weapons,\" Read said. \"They know\\n we have only gas grenades and small arms.\"\\n\\n\\n He looked nervously from side to side. They couldn\\'t bring the\\n copter in with that thing squatting out there.\\n\\n\\n A few feet away, sprawled behind a barricade of tables, lay a man\\n in advanced shock. His deadly white skin shone like ivory. They\\n wouldn\\'t even look like that. One nuclear shell from that gun and\\n they\\'d be vaporized. Or perhaps the tank had sonic projectors;\\n then the skin would peel off their bones. Or they might be\\n burned, or cut up by shrapnel, or gassed with some new mist their\\n masks couldn\\'t filter.\\n\\n\\n Read shut his eyes. All around him he heard heavy breathing,\\n mumbled comments, curses. Clothes rustled as men moved restlessly.\\n\\n\\n But already the voice of Sergeant Rashid resounded in the murky\\n room.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve got to knock that thing out before the copter comes.\\n Otherwise, he can\\'t land. I have six Molotov cocktails here. Who\\n wants to go hunting with me?\"\\n\\n\\n For two years Read had served under Sergeant Rashid. To him, the\\n sergeant was everything a UN inspector should be. Rashid\\'s\\n devotion to peace had no limits.\\n\\n\\n Read\\'s psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good\\n enough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might\\n conflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required\\n something more than a hunger for self-respect.\\n\\n\\n Read had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had\\n watched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen\\n another inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this\\n building, lay battered men and dead men.\\n\\n\\n All UN inspectors. All part of his life.\\n\\n\\n And he was part of their life. Their blood, their sacrifice, and\\n pain, had become a part of him.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll take a cocktail, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that Read?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who else did you expect?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nobody. Anybody else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll go,\" the Frenchman said. \"Three should be enough. Give us a\\n good smoke screen.\"\\nRashid snapped orders. He put the German inspector in charge of\\n Umluana. Read, the Frenchman and himself, he stationed at\\n thirty-foot intervals along the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"Remember,\" Rashid said. \"We have to knock out that gun.\"\\n\\n\\n Read had given away his machine gun. He held a gas-filled bottle\\n in each hand. His automatic nestled in its shoulder holster.\\n\\n\\n Rashid whistled.\\n\\n\\n Dozens of smoke grenades tumbled through the air. Thick mist\\n engulfed the tank. Read stood up and ran forward. He crouched but\\n didn\\'t zigzag. Speed counted most here.\\n\\n\\n Gunfire shook the hill. The Belderkans couldn\\'t see them but they\\n knew what was going on and they fired systematically into the\\n smoke.\\n\\n\\n Bullets ploughed the ground beside him. He raised his head and\\n found the dim silhouette of the tank. He tried not to think about\\n bullets ploughing through his flesh.\\n\\n\\n A bullet slammed into his hip. He fell on his back, screaming.\\n \"Sarge.\\nSarge.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m hit, too,\" Rashid said. \"Don\\'t stop if you can move.\"\\nListen to him. What\\'s he got, a sprained ankle?\\nBut he didn\\'t feel any pain. He closed his eyes and threw himself\\n onto his stomach. And nearly fainted from pain. He screamed and\\n quivered. The pain stopped. He stretched out his hands, gripping\\n the wine bottles, and inched forward. Pain stabbed him from\\n stomach to knee.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t move, Sarge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Read, you\\'ve got to. I think you\\'re the only—\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n Guns clattered. Bullets cracked.\\n\\n\\n \"Sergeant Rashid! Answer me.\"\\n\\n\\n He heard nothing but the lonely passage of the bullets in the\\n mist.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m a UN man,\" he mumbled. \"You people up there know what a UN\\n man is? You know what happens when you meet one?\"\\n\\n\\n When he reached the tank, he had another bullet in his right arm.\\n But they didn\\'t know he was coming and when you get within ten\\n feet of a tank, the men inside can\\'t see you.\\n\\n\\n He just had to stand up and drop the bottle down the gun barrel.\\n That was all—with a broken hip and a wounded right arm.\\n\\n\\n He knew they would see him when he stood up but he didn\\'t think\\n about that. He didn\\'t think about Sergeant Rashid, about the\\n complicated politics of Africa, about crowded market streets. He\\n had to kill the tank. That was all he thought about. He had\\n decided something in the world was more important than himself,\\n but he didn\\'t know it or realize the psychologists would be\\n surprised to see him do this. He had made many decisions in the\\n last few minutes. He had ceased to think about them or anything\\n else.\\n\\n\\n With his cigarette lighter, he lit the rag stuffed in the end of\\n the bottle.\\n\\n\\n Biting his tongue, he pulled himself up the front of the tank.\\n His long arm stretched for the muzzle of the gun. He tossed the\\n bottle down the dark throat.\\n\\n\\n As he fell, the machine-gun bullets hit him in the chest, then in\\n the neck. He didn\\'t feel them. He had fainted the moment he felt\\n the bottle leave his hand.\\n\\n\\n The copter landed ten minutes later. Umluana left in a shower of\\n bullets. A Russian private, the ranking man alive in the station,\\n surrendered the survivors to the Belderkans.\\nHis mother hung the Global Medal above the television set.\\n\\n\\n \"He must have been brave,\" she said. \"We had a fine son.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He was our only son,\" her husband said. \"What did he volunteer\\n for? Couldn\\'t somebody else have done it?\"\\n\\n\\n His wife started to cry. Awkwardly, he embraced her. He wondered\\n what his son had wanted that he couldn\\'t get at home.\\nTHE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Alan stopped,\\n puzzled. Two more blasts, quickly\\n together, and the sound of a\\n scream faintly.\\n\\n\\n Frowning, worrying about the\\n sounds, Alan momentarily forgot\\n to watch his step until his foot\\n suddenly plunged into an ant\\n hill, throwing him to the jungle\\n floor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again,\\n for the tenth time, and stood\\n uncertainly in the dimness.\\n From tall, moss-shrouded trees,\\n wrist-thick vines hung quietly,\\n scraping the spongy ground like\\n the tentacles of some monstrous\\n tree-bound octopus. Fitful little\\n plants grew straggly in the\\n shadows of the mossy trunks,\\n forming a dense underbrush that\\n made walking difficult. At midday\\n some few of the blue sun\\'s\\n rays filtered through to the\\n jungle floor, but now, late afternoon\\n on the planet, the shadows\\n were long and gloomy.\\n\\n\\n Alan peered around him at the\\n vine-draped shadows, listening\\n to the soft rustlings and faint\\n twig-snappings of life in the\\n jungle. Two short, popping\\n sounds echoed across the stillness,\\n drowned out almost immediately\\n and silenced by an\\n explosive crash. Alan started,\\n \"Blaster fighting! But it can\\'t\\n be!\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly anxious, he slashed\\n a hurried X in one of the trees\\n to mark his position then turned\\n to follow a line of similar marks\\n back through the jungle. He\\n tried to run, but vines blocked\\n his way and woody shrubs\\n caught at his legs, tripping him\\n and holding him back. Then,\\n through the trees he saw the\\n clearing of the camp site, the\\n temporary home for the scout\\n ship and the eleven men who,\\n with Alan, were the only humans\\n on the jungle planet, Waiamea.\\nStepping through the low\\n shrubbery at the edge of the\\n site, he looked across the open\\n area to the two temporary structures,\\n the camp headquarters\\n where the power supplies and\\n the computer were; and the\\n sleeping quarters. Beyond, nose\\n high, stood the silver scout ship\\n that had brought the advance\\n exploratory party of scientists\\n and technicians to Waiamea\\n three days before. Except for a\\n few of the killer robots rolling\\n slowly around the camp site on\\n their quiet treads, there was no\\n one about.\\n\\n\\n \"So, they\\'ve finally got those\\n things working.\" Alan smiled\\n slightly. \"Guess that means I\\n owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda\\n for sure. Anybody who can\\n build a robot that hunts by homing\\n in on animals\\' mind impulses ...\"\\n He stepped forward\\n just as a roar of blue flame dissolved\\n the branches of a tree,\\n barely above his head.\\n\\n\\n Without pausing to think,\\n Alan leaped back, and fell\\n sprawling over a bush just as\\n one of the robots rolled silently\\n up from the right, lowering its\\n blaster barrel to aim directly at\\n his head. Alan froze. \"My God,\\n Pete built those things wrong!\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\\n of claws and teeth hurled\\n itself from the smoldering\\n branches and crashed against the\\n robot, clawing insanely at the\\n antenna and blaster barrel.\\n With an awkward jerk the robot\\n swung around and fired its blaster,\\n completely dissolving the\\n lower half of the cat creature\\n which had clung across the barrel.\\n But the back pressure of the\\n cat\\'s body overloaded the discharge\\n circuits. The robot started\\n to shake, then clicked sharply\\n as an overload relay snapped\\n and shorted the blaster cells.\\n The killer turned and rolled back\\n towards the camp, leaving Alan\\n alone.\\n\\n\\n Shakily, Alan crawled a few\\n feet back into the undergrowth\\n where he could lie and watch the\\n camp, but not himself be seen.\\n Though visibility didn\\'t make\\n any difference to the robots, he\\n felt safer, somehow, hidden. He\\n knew now what the shooting\\n sounds had been and why there\\n hadn\\'t been anyone around the\\n camp site. A charred blob lying\\n in the grass of the clearing confirmed\\n his hypothesis. His stomach\\n felt sick.\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\\n himself, \"that Pete assembled\\n these robots in a batch and then\\n activated them all at once, probably\\n never living to realize that\\n they\\'re tuned to pick up human\\n brain waves, too. Damn!\\n Damn!\" His eyes blurred and\\n he slammed his fist into the soft\\n earth.\\n\\n\\n When he raised his eyes again\\n the jungle was perceptibly darker.\\n Stealthy rustlings in the\\n shadows grew louder with the\\n setting sun. Branches snapped\\n unaccountably in the trees overhead\\n and every now and then\\n leaves or a twig fell softly to the\\n ground, close to where he lay.\\n Reaching into his jacket, Alan\\n fingered his pocket blaster. He\\n pulled it out and held it in his\\n right hand. \"This pop gun\\n wouldn\\'t even singe a robot, but\\n it just might stop one of those\\n pumas.\"\\nThey said the blast with your name on it would find\\n you anywhere. This looked like Alan\\'s blast.\\nSlowly Alan looked around,\\n sizing up his situation. Behind\\n him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\\n He shuddered. \"Not a\\n very healthy spot to spend the\\n night. On the other hand, I certainly\\n can\\'t get to the camp with\\n a pack of mind-activated mechanical\\n killers running around.\\n If I can just hold out until morning,\\n when the big ship arrives ...\\n The big ship! Good\\n Lord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\\n oily sweat punctuated his forehead.\\n Peggy, arriving tomorrow\\n with the other colonists, the\\n wives and kids! The metal killers,\\n tuned to blast any living\\n flesh, would murder them the\\n instant they stepped from the\\n ship!\\nA pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\\n he\\'d married just three weeks\\n ago. He still couldn\\'t believe it.\\n It was crazy, he supposed, to\\n marry a girl and then take off\\n for an unknown planet, with her\\n to follow, to try to create a home\\n in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\\n but Peggy and her green eyes\\n that changed color with the\\n light, with her soft brown hair,\\n and her happy smile, had ended\\n thirty years of loneliness and\\n had, at last, given him a reason\\n for living. \"Not to be killed!\"\\n Alan unclenched his fists and\\n wiped his palms, bloody where\\n his fingernails had dug into the\\n flesh.\\n\\n\\n There was a slight creak above\\n him like the protesting of a\\n branch too heavily laden. Blaster\\n ready, Alan rolled over onto his\\n back. In the movement, his elbow\\n struck the top of a small\\n earthy mound and he was instantly\\n engulfed in a swarm of\\n locust-like insects that beat disgustingly\\n against his eyes and\\n mouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\\n arms before his face he jumped\\n up and backwards, away from\\n the bugs. As he did so, a dark\\n shapeless thing plopped from\\n the trees onto the spot where he\\n had been lying stretched out.\\n Then, like an ambient fungus,\\n it slithered off into the jungle\\n undergrowth.\\n\\n\\n For a split second the jungle\\n stood frozen in a brilliant blue\\n flash, followed by the sharp report\\n of a blaster. Then another.\\n Alan whirled, startled. The\\n planet\\'s double moon had risen\\n and he could see a robot rolling\\n slowly across the clearing in his\\n general direction, blasting indiscriminately\\n at whatever mind\\n impulses came within its pickup\\n range, birds, insects, anything.\\n Six or seven others also left the\\n camp headquarters area and\\n headed for the jungle, each to a\\n slightly different spot.\\n\\n\\n Apparently the robot hadn\\'t\\n sensed him yet, but Alan didn\\'t\\n know what the effective range\\n of its pickup devices was. He\\n began to slide back into the\\n jungle. Minutes later, looking\\n back he saw that the machine,\\n though several hundred yards\\n away, had altered its course and\\n was now headed directly for\\n him.\\n\\n\\n His stomach tightened. Panic.\\n The dank, musty smell of the\\n jungle seemed for an instant to\\n thicken and choke in his throat.\\n Then he thought of the big ship\\n landing in the morning, settling\\n down slowly after a lonely two-week\\n voyage. He thought of a\\n brown-haired girl crowding with\\n the others to the gangway, eager\\n to embrace the new planet, and\\n the next instant a charred nothing,\\n unrecognizable, the victim\\n of a design error or a misplaced\\n wire in a machine. \"I have to\\n try,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\\n try.\" He moved into the blackness.\\n\\n\\n Powerful as a small tank, the\\n killer robot was equipped to\\n crush, slash, and burn its way\\n through undergrowth. Nevertheless,\\n it was slowed by the\\n larger trees and the thick, clinging\\n vines, and Alan found that\\n he could manage to keep ahead\\n of it, barely out of blaster range.\\n Only, the robot didn\\'t get tired.\\n Alan did.\\n\\n\\n The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\\n shadows that wavered\\n and danced across the jungle\\n floor, hiding debris that tripped\\n him and often sent him sprawling\\n into the dark. Sharp-edged\\n growths tore at his face and\\n clothes, and insects attracted by\\n the blood matted against his\\n pants and shirt. Behind, the robot\\n crashed imperturbably after\\n him, lighting the night with fitful\\n blaster flashes as some\\n winged or legged life came within\\n its range.\\n\\n\\n There was movement also, in\\n the darkness beside him, scrapings\\n and rustlings and an occasional\\n low, throaty sound like an\\n angry cat. Alan\\'s fingers tensed\\n on his pocket blaster. Swift\\n shadowy forms moved quickly in\\n the shrubs and the growling became\\n suddenly louder. He fired\\n twice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\\n Sharp screams punctuated\\n the electric blue discharge as\\n a pack of small feline creatures\\n leaped snarling and clawing\\n back into the night.\\nMentally, Alan tried to figure\\n the charge remaining in his blaster.\\n There wouldn\\'t be much.\\n \"Enough for a few more shots,\\n maybe. Why the devil didn\\'t I\\n load in fresh cells this morning!\"\\n\\n\\n The robot crashed on, louder\\n now, gaining on the tired human.\\n Legs aching and bruised,\\n stinging from insect bites, Alan\\n tried to force himself to run\\n holding his hands in front of\\n him like a child in the dark. His\\n foot tripped on a barely visible\\n insect hill and a winged swarm\\n exploded around him. Startled,\\n Alan jerked sideways, crashing\\n his head against a tree. He\\n clutched at the bark for a second,\\n dazed, then his knees\\n buckled. His blaster fell into the\\n shadows.\\n\\n\\n The robot crashed loudly behind\\n him now. Without stopping\\n to think, Alan fumbled along the\\n ground after his gun, straining\\n his eyes in the darkness. He\\n found it just a couple of feet to\\n one side, against the base of a\\n small bush. Just as his fingers\\n closed upon the barrel his other\\n hand slipped into something\\n sticky that splashed over his\\n forearm. He screamed in pain\\n and leaped back, trying frantically\\n to wipe the clinging,\\n burning blackness off his arm.\\n Patches of black scraped off onto\\n branches and vines, but the rest\\n spread slowly over his arm as\\n agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\\n being ripped away layer by\\n layer.\\n\\n\\n Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\\n Alan stumbled forward.\\n Sharp muscle spasms shot from\\n his shoulder across his back and\\n chest. Tears streamed across his\\n cheeks.\\n\\n\\n A blue arc slashed at the trees\\n a mere hundred yards behind.\\n He screamed at the blast. \"Damn\\n you, Pete! Damn your robots!\\n Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\\n He stepped into emptiness.\\n\\n\\n Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\\n by the water, the pain began to\\n fall away. He wanted to lie there\\n forever in the dark, cool, wetness.\\n For ever, and ever, and ...\\n The air thundered.\\n\\n\\n In the dim light he could see\\n the banks of the stream, higher\\n than a man, muddy and loose.\\n Growing right to the edge of the\\n banks, the jungle reached out\\n with hairy, disjointed arms as\\n if to snag even the dirty little\\n stream that passed so timidly\\n through its domain.\\n\\n\\n Alan, lying in the mud of the\\n stream bed, felt the earth shake\\n as the heavy little robot rolled\\n slowly and inexorably towards\\n him. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\\n he thought, \"in battle\\n dress.\" He tried to stand but his\\n legs were almost too weak and\\n his arm felt numb. \"I\\'ll drown\\n him,\" he said aloud. \"I\\'ll drown\\n the Lord High Executioner.\" He\\n laughed. Then his mind cleared.\\n He remembered where he was.\\nAlan trembled. For the first\\n time in his life he understood\\n what it was to live, because for\\n the first time he realized that he\\n would sometime die. In other\\n times and circumstances he\\n might put it off for a while, for\\n months or years, but eventually,\\n as now, he would have to watch,\\n still and helpless, while death\\n came creeping. Then, at thirty,\\n Alan became a man.\\n\\n\\n \"Dammit, no law says I have\\n to flame-out\\nnow\\n!\" He forced\\n himself to rise, forced his legs\\n to stand, struggling painfully in\\n the shin-deep ooze. He worked\\n his way to the bank and began to\\n dig frenziedly, chest high, about\\n two feet below the edge.\\n\\n\\n His arm where the black thing\\n had been was swollen and tender,\\n but he forced his hands to dig,\\n dig, dig, cursing and crying to\\n hide the pain, and biting his\\n lips, ignoring the salty taste of\\n blood. The soft earth crumbled\\n under his hands until he had a\\n small cave about three feet deep\\n in the bank. Beyond that the\\n soil was held too tightly by the\\n roots from above and he had to\\n stop.\\nThe air crackled blue and a\\n tree crashed heavily past Alan\\n into the stream. Above him on\\n the bank, silhouetting against\\n the moons, the killer robot stopped\\n and its blaster swivelled\\n slowly down. Frantically, Alan\\n hugged the bank as a shaft of\\n pure electricity arced over him,\\n sliced into the water, and exploded\\n in a cloud of steam. The\\n robot shook for a second, its\\n blaster muzzle lifted erratically\\n and for an instant it seemed almost\\n out of control, then it\\n quieted and the muzzle again\\n pointed down.\\n\\n\\n Pressing with all his might,\\n Alan slid slowly along the bank\\n inches at a time, away from the\\n machine above. Its muzzle turned\\n to follow him but the edge of\\n the bank blocked its aim. Grinding\\n forward a couple of feet,\\n slightly overhanging the bank,\\n the robot fired again. For a split\\n second Alan seemed engulfed in\\n flame; the heat of hell singed his\\n head and back, and mud boiled\\n in the bank by his arm.\\n\\n\\n Again the robot trembled. It\\n jerked forward a foot and its\\n blaster swung slightly away. But\\n only for a moment. Then the gun\\n swung back again.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly, as if sensing something\\n wrong, its tracks slammed\\n into reverse. It stood poised for\\n a second, its treads spinning\\n crazily as the earth collapsed underneath\\n it, where Alan had\\n dug, then it fell with a heavy\\n splash into the mud, ten feet\\n from where Alan stood.\\n\\n\\n Without hesitation Alan\\n threw himself across the blaster\\n housing, frantically locking his\\n arms around the barrel as the\\n robot\\'s treads churned furiously\\n in the sticky mud, causing it to\\n buck and plunge like a Brahma\\n bull. The treads stopped and the\\n blaster jerked upwards wrenching\\n Alan\\'s arms, then slammed\\n down. Then the whole housing\\n whirled around and around, tilting\\n alternately up and down like\\n a steel-skinned water monster\\n trying to dislodge a tenacious\\n crab, while Alan, arms and legs\\n wrapped tightly around the blaster\\n barrel and housing, pressed\\n fiercely against the robot\\'s metal\\n skin.\\n\\n\\n Slowly, trying to anticipate\\n and shift his weight with the\\n spinning plunges, Alan worked\\n his hand down to his right hip.\\n He fumbled for the sheath clipped\\n to his belt, found it, and extracted\\n a stubby hunting knife.\\n Sweat and blood in his eyes,\\n hardly able to move on the wildly\\n swinging turret, he felt down\\n the sides to the thin crack between\\n the revolving housing and\\n the stationary portion of the robot.\\n With a quick prayer he\\n jammed in the knife blade—and\\n was whipped headlong into the\\n mud as the turret literally snapped\\n to a stop.\\n\\n\\n The earth, jungle and moons\\n spun in a pinwheeled blur,\\n slowed, and settled to their proper\\n places. Standing in the sticky,\\n sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\\n the robot apprehensively. Half\\n buried in mud, it stood quiet in\\n the shadowy light except for an\\n occasional, almost spasmodic\\n jerk of its blaster barrel. For\\n the first time that night Alan\\n allowed himself a slight smile.\\n \"A blade in the old gear box,\\n eh? How does that feel, boy?\"\\n\\n\\n He turned. \"Well, I\\'d better\\n get out of here before the knife\\n slips or the monster cooks up\\n some more tricks with whatever\\n it\\'s got for a brain.\" Digging\\n little footholds in the soft bank,\\n he climbed up and stood once\\n again in the rustling jungle\\n darkness.\\n\\n\\n \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\\n Pete could cram enough brain\\n into one of those things to make\\n it hunt and track so perfectly.\"\\n He tried to visualize the computing\\n circuits needed for the\\n operation of its tracking mechanism\\n alone. \"There just isn\\'t\\n room for the electronics. You\\'d\\n need a computer as big as the\\n one at camp headquarters.\"\\nIn the distance the sky blazed\\n as a blaster roared in the jungle.\\n Then Alan heard the approaching\\n robot, crunching and snapping\\n its way through the undergrowth\\n like an onrushing forest\\n fire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\\n They communicate with each\\n other! The one I jammed must\\n be calling others to help.\"\\n\\n\\n He began to move along the\\n bank, away from the crashing\\n sounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\\n eyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\\n I\\'ll bet anything they\\'re\\n automatically controlled by the\\n camp computer. That\\'s where\\n their brain is!\" He paused.\\n \"Then, if that were put out of\\n commission ...\" He jerked away\\n from the bank and half ran, half\\n pulled himself through the undergrowth\\n towards the camp.\\n\\n\\n Trees exploded to his left as\\n another robot fired in his direction,\\n too far away to be effective\\n but churning towards him\\n through the blackness.\\n\\n\\n Alan changed direction slightly\\n to follow a line between the\\n two robots coming up from\\n either side, behind him. His eyes\\n were well accustomed to the dark\\n now, and he managed to dodge\\n most of the shadowy vines and\\n branches before they could snag\\n or trip him. Even so, he stumbled\\n in the wiry underbrush and\\n his legs were a mass of stinging\\n slashes from ankle to thigh.\\n\\n\\n The crashing rumble of the\\n killer robots shook the night behind\\n him, nearer sometimes,\\n then falling slightly back, but\\n following constantly, more\\n unshakable than bloodhounds\\n because a man can sometimes cover\\n a scent, but no man can stop his\\n thoughts. Intermittently, like\\n photographers\\' strobes, blue\\n flashes would light the jungle\\n about him. Then, for seconds\\n afterwards his eyes would see\\n dancing streaks of yellow and\\n sharp multi-colored pinwheels\\n that alternately shrunk and expanded\\n as if in a surrealist\\'s\\n nightmare. Alan would have to\\n pause and squeeze his eyelids\\n tight shut before he could see\\n again, and the robots would\\n move a little closer.\\n\\n\\n To his right the trees silhouetted\\n briefly against brilliance as\\n a third robot slowly moved up\\n in the distance. Without thinking,\\n Alan turned slightly to the\\n left, then froze in momentary\\n panic. \"I should be at the camp\\n now. Damn, what direction am\\n I going?\" He tried to think\\n back, to visualize the twists and\\n turns he\\'d taken in the jungle.\\n \"All I need is to get lost.\"\\n\\n\\n He pictured the camp computer\\n with no one to stop it, automatically\\n sending its robots in\\n wider and wider forays, slowly\\n wiping every trace of life from\\n the planet. Technologically advanced\\n machines doing the job\\n for which they were built, completely,\\n thoroughly, without feeling,\\n and without human masters\\n to separate sense from futility.\\n Finally parts would wear out,\\n circuits would short, and one by\\n one the killers would crunch to\\n a halt. A few birds would still\\n fly then, but a unique animal\\n life, rare in the universe, would\\n exist no more. And the bones of\\n children, eager girls, and their\\n men would also lie, beside a\\n rusty hulk, beneath the alien\\n sun.\\n\\n\\n \"Peggy!\"\\n\\n\\n As if in answer, a tree beside\\n him breathed fire, then exploded.\\n In the brief flash of the\\n blaster shot, Alan saw the steel\\n glint of a robot only a hundred\\n yards away, much nearer than\\n he had thought. \"Thank heaven\\n for trees!\" He stepped back, felt\\n his foot catch in something,\\n clutched futilely at some leaves\\n and fell heavily.\\n\\n\\n Pain danced up his leg as he\\n grabbed his ankle. Quickly he\\n felt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\\n the rotten luck, anyway!\" He\\n blinked the pain tears from his\\n eyes and looked up—into a robot\\'s\\n blaster, jutting out of the\\n foliage, thirty yards away.\\nInstinctively, in one motion\\n Alan grabbed his pocket blaster\\n and fired. To his amazement the\\n robot jerked back, its gun wobbled\\n and started to tilt away.\\n Then, getting itself under control,\\n it swung back again to face\\n Alan. He fired again, and again\\n the robot reacted. It seemed familiar\\n somehow. Then he remembered\\n the robot on the river\\n bank, jiggling and swaying for\\n seconds after each shot. \"Of\\n course!\" He cursed himself for\\n missing the obvious. \"The blaster\\n static blanks out radio\\n transmission from the computer\\n for a few seconds. They even do\\n it to themselves!\"\\n\\n\\n Firing intermittently, he\\n pulled himself upright and hobbled\\n ahead through the bush.\\n The robot shook spasmodically\\n with each shot, its gun tilted upward\\n at an awkward angle.\\n\\n\\n Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\\n stars, real stars brilliant in the\\n night sky, and half dragging his\\n swelling leg he stumbled out of\\n the jungle into the camp clearing.\\n Ahead, across fifty yards of\\n grass stood the headquarters\\n building, housing the robot-controlling\\n computer. Still firing at\\n short intervals he started across\\n the clearing, gritting his teeth\\n at every step.\\n\\n\\n Straining every muscle in\\n spite of the agonizing pain, Alan\\n forced himself to a limping run\\n across the uneven ground, carefully\\n avoiding the insect hills\\n that jutted up through the grass.\\n From the corner of his eye he\\n saw another of the robots standing\\n shakily in the dark edge of\\n the jungle waiting, it seemed,\\n for his small blaster to run dry.\\n\\n\\n \"Be damned! You can\\'t win\\n now!\" Alan yelled between blaster\\n shots, almost irrational from\\n the pain that ripped jaggedly\\n through his leg. Then it happened.\\n A few feet from the\\n building\\'s door his blaster quit.\\n A click. A faint hiss when he\\n frantically jerked the trigger\\n again and again, and the spent\\n cells released themselves from\\n the device, falling in the grass\\n at his feet. He dropped the useless\\n gun.\\n\\n\\n \"No!\" He threw himself on\\n the ground as a new robot suddenly\\n appeared around the edge\\n of the building a few feet away,\\n aimed, and fired. Air burned\\n over Alan\\'s back and ozone tingled\\n in his nostrils.\\n\\n\\n Blinding itself for a few seconds\\n with its own blaster static,\\n the robot paused momentarily,\\n jiggling in place. In this\\n instant, Alan jammed his hands\\n into an insect hill and hurled the\\n pile of dirt and insects directly\\n at the robot\\'s antenna. In a flash,\\n hundreds of the winged things\\n erupted angrily from the hole in\\n a swarming cloud, each part of\\n which was a speck of life\\n transmitting mental energy to the\\n robot\\'s pickup devices.\\n\\n\\n Confused by the sudden dispersion\\n of mind impulses, the\\n robot fired erratically as Alan\\n crouched and raced painfully for\\n the door. It fired again, closer,\\n as he fumbled with the lock\\n release. Jagged bits of plastic and\\n stone ripped past him, torn loose\\n by the blast.\\n\\n\\n Frantically, Alan slammed\\n open the door as the robot, sensing\\n him strongly now, aimed\\n point blank. He saw nothing, his\\n mind thought of nothing but the\\n red-clad safety switch mounted\\n beside the computer. Time stopped.\\n There was nothing else in\\n the world. He half-jumped, half-fell\\n towards it, slowly, in tenths\\n of seconds that seemed measured\\n out in years.\\n\\n\\n The universe went black.\\n\\n\\n Later. Brilliance pressed upon\\n his eyes. Then pain returned, a\\n multi-hurting thing that crawled\\n through his body and dragged\\n ragged tentacles across his\\n brain. He moaned.\\n\\n\\n A voice spoke hollowly in the\\n distance. \"He\\'s waking. Call his\\n wife.\"\\n\\n\\n Alan opened his eyes in a\\n white room; a white light hung\\n over his head. Beside him, looking\\n down with a rueful smile,\\n stood a young man wearing\\n space medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\\n he acknowledged the question in\\n Alan\\'s eyes, \"you hit the switch.\\n That was three days ago. When\\n you\\'re up again we\\'d all like to\\n thank you.\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\\n green-eyed girl was pressed\\n tightly against him. Neither of\\n them spoke. They couldn\\'t. There\\n was too much to say.\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\\nOctober 1958.

Happy\\n about it? Lucky you!\\nFrank Pembroke\\n sat behind\\n the desk of his shabby\\n little office over Lemark\\'s Liquors\\n in downtown Los Angeles and\\n waited for his first customer. He\\n had been in business for a week\\n and as yet had had no callers.\\n Therefore, it was with a mingled\\n sense of excitement and satisfaction\\n that he greeted the tall,\\n dark, smooth-faced figure that\\n came up the stairs and into the\\n office shortly before noon.\\n\\n\\n \"Good day, sir,\" said Pembroke\\n with an amiable smile. \"I\\n see my advertisement has interested\\n you. Please stand in that\\n corner for just a moment.\"\\n\\n\\n Opening the desk drawer,\\n which was almost empty, Pembroke\\n removed an automatic pistol\\n fitted with a silencer. Pointing\\n it at the amazed customer, he\\n fired four .22 caliber longs into\\n the narrow chest. Then he made\\n a telephone call and sat down to\\n wait. He wondered how long it\\n would be before his next client\\n would arrive.\\nThe series of events leading up\\n to Pembroke\\'s present occupation\\n had commenced on a dismal,\\n overcast evening in the South\\n Pacific a year earlier. Bound for\\n Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,\\n the Colombian tramp\\n steamer\\nElena Mia\\nhad encountered\\n a dense greenish fog which\\n seemed vaguely redolent of citrus\\n trees. Standing on the forward\\n deck, Pembroke was one of the\\n first to perceive the peculiar odor\\n and to spot the immense gray\\n hulk wallowing in the murky distance.\\n\\n\\n Then the explosion had come,\\n from far below the waterline,\\n and the decks were awash with\\n frantic crewmen, officers, and the\\n handful of passengers. Only two\\n lifeboats were launched before\\n the\\nElena Mia\\nwent down. Pembroke\\n was in the second. The\\n roar of the sinking ship was the\\n last thing he heard for some\\n time.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke came as close to being\\n a professional adventurer as\\n one can in these days of regimented\\n travel, organized peril,\\n and political restriction. He had\\n made for himself a substantial\\n fortune through speculation in a\\n great variety of properties, real\\n and otherwise. Life had given\\n him much and demanded little,\\n which was perhaps the reason\\n for his restiveness.\\nLoyalty to person or to people\\n was a trait Pembroke had never\\n recognized in himself, nor had it\\n ever been expected of him. And\\n yet he greatly envied those\\n staunch patriots and lovers who\\n could find it in themselves to\\n elevate the glory and safety of\\n others above that of themselves.\\n\\n\\n Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke\\n adapted quickly to the situation\\n in which he found himself\\n when he regained consciousness.\\n He awoke in a small room in\\n what appeared to be a typical\\n modern American hotel. The wallet\\n in his pocket contained exactly\\n what it should, approximately\\n three hundred dollars.\\n His next thought was of food.\\n He left the room and descended\\n via the elevator to the restaurant.\\n Here he observed that it\\n was early afternoon. Ordering\\n a full dinner, for he was unusually\\n hungry, he began to study the\\n others in the restaurant.\\n\\n\\n Many of the faces seemed familiar;\\n the crew of the ship,\\n probably. He also recognized several\\n of the passengers. However,\\n he made no attempt to speak to\\n them. After his meal, he bought\\n a good corona and went for a\\n walk. His situation could have\\n been any small western American\\n seacoast city. He heard the hiss\\n of the ocean in the direction the\\n afternoon sun was taking. In his\\n full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching\\n the beach.\\n\\n\\n On the sand he saw a number\\n of sun bathers. One in particular,\\n an attractive woman of about\\n thirty, tossed back her long,\\n chestnut locks and gazed up intently\\n at Pembroke as he passed.\\n Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous\\n an invitation. He halted\\n and stared down at her for a few\\n moments.\\n\\n\\n \"You are looking for someone?\"\\n she inquired.\\n\\n\\n \"Much of the time,\" said the\\n man.\\n\\n\\n \"Could it be me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It could be.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yet you seem unsure,\" she\\n said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke smiled, uneasily.\\n There was something not entirely\\n normal about her conversation.\\n Though the rest of her compensated\\n for that.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me what\\'s wrong with\\n me,\" she went on urgently. \"I\\'m\\n not good enough, am I? I mean,\\n there\\'s something wrong with\\n the way I look or act. Isn\\'t there?\\n Please help me, please!\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re not casual enough, for\\n one thing,\" said Pembroke, deciding\\n to play along with her for\\n the moment. \"You\\'re too tense.\\n Also you\\'re a bit knock-kneed,\\n not that it matters. Is that what\\n you wanted to hear?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes—I mean, I suppose\\n so. I can try to be more casual.\\n But I don\\'t know what to do\\n about my knees,\" she said wistfully,\\n staring across at the\\n smooth, tan limbs. \"Do you think\\n I\\'m okay otherwise? I mean, as a\\n whole I\\'m not so bad, am I? Oh,\\n please tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about talking it over at\\n supper tonight?\" Pembroke proposed.\\n \"Maybe with less distraction\\n I\\'ll have a better picture of\\n you—as a whole.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, that\\'s very generous of\\n you,\" the woman told him. She\\n scribbled a name and an address\\n on a small piece of paper and\\n handed it to him. \"Any time\\n after six,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke left the beach and\\n walked through several small\\n specialty shops. He tried to get\\n the woman off his mind, but the\\n oddness of her conversation continued\\n to bother him. She was\\n right about being different, but\\n it was her concern about being\\n different that made her so. How\\n to explain\\nthat\\nto her?\\nThen he saw the weird little\\n glass statuette among the usual\\n bric-a-brac. It rather resembled\\n a ground hog, had seven fingers\\n on each of its six limbs, and\\n smiled up at him as he stared.\\n\\n\\n \"Can I help you, sir?\" a middle-aged\\n saleswoman inquired.\\n \"Oh, good heavens, whatever is\\n that thing doing here?\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched with lifted\\n eyebrows as the clerk whisked\\n the bizarre statuette underneath\\n the counter.\\n\\n\\n \"What the hell was that?\"\\n Pembroke demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, you know—or don\\'t you?\\n Oh, my,\" she concluded, \"are you\\n one of the—strangers?\"\\n\\n\\n \"And if I were?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'d certainly appreciate\\n it if you\\'d tell me how I walk.\"\\nShe came around in front of\\n the counter and strutted back\\n and forth a few times.\\n\\n\\n \"They tell me I lean too far\\n forward,\" she confided. \"But I\\n should think you\\'d fall down if\\n you didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t try to go so fast and\\n you won\\'t fall down,\" suggested\\n Pembroke. \"You\\'re in too much\\n of a hurry. Also those fake flowers\\n on your blouse make you look\\n frumpy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'m supposed to look\\n frumpy,\" the woman retorted.\\n \"That\\'s the type of person I am.\\n But you can look frumpy and still\\n walk natural, can\\'t you? Everyone\\n says you can.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, they\\'ve got a point,\"\\n said Pembroke. \"Incidentally,\\n just where are we, anyway?\\n What city is this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Puerto Pacifico,\" she told\\n him. \"Isn\\'t that a lovely name?\\n It means peaceful port. In Spanish.\"\\n\\n\\n That was fine. At least he now\\n knew where he was. But as he\\n left the shop he began checking\\n off every west coast state, city,\\n town, and inlet. None, to the best\\n of his knowledge, was called\\n Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n He headed for the nearest\\n service station and asked for a\\n map. The attendant gave him one\\n which showed the city, but nothing\\n beyond.\\n\\n\\n \"Which way is it to San Francisco?\"\\n asked Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \"That all depends on where\\n you are,\" the boy returned.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, then where am I?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pardon me, there\\'s a customer,\"\\n the boy said. \"This is\\n Puerto Pacifico.\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke watched him hurry\\n off to service a car with a sense\\n of having been given the runaround.\\n To his surprise, the boy\\n came back a few minutes later\\n after servicing the automobile.\\n\\n\\n \"Say, I\\'ve just figured out who\\n you are,\" the youngster told him.\\n \"I\\'d sure appreciate it if you\\'d\\n give me a little help on my lingo.\\n Also, you gas up the car first,\\n then try to sell \\'em the oil—right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right,\" said Pembroke wearily.\\n \"What\\'s wrong with your\\n lingo? Other than the fact that\\n it\\'s not colloquial enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not enough slang, huh? Well,\\n I guess I\\'ll have to concentrate\\n on that. How about the smile?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perfect,\" Pembroke told him.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" said the boy delightedly.\\n \"Say, come back again,\\n huh? I sure appreciate the help.\\n Keep the map.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks. One more thing,\"\\n Pembroke said. \"What\\'s over\\n that way—outside the city?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sand.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about that way?\" he\\n asked, pointing north. \"And that\\n way?\" pointing south.\\n\\n\\n \"More of the same.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Any railroads?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That we ain\\'t got.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Buses? Airlines?\"\\n\\n\\n The kid shook his head.\\n\\n\\n \"Some city.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\\'s kinda isolated. A\\n lot of ships dock here, though.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All cargo ships, I\\'ll bet. No\\n passengers,\" said Pembroke.\\n\\n\\n \"Right,\" said the attendant,\\n giving with his perfect smile.\\n\\n\\n \"No getting out of here, is\\n there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s for sure,\" the boy said,\\n walking away to wait on another\\n customer. \"If you don\\'t like the\\n place, you\\'ve had it.\"\\nPembroke returned to the\\n hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized\\n one of the\\nElena Mia\\'s\\npaying\\n passengers. He was a short,\\n rectangular little man in his fifties\\n named Spencer. He sat in a\\n booth with three young women,\\n all lovely, all effusive. The topic\\n of the conversation turned out\\n to be precisely what Pembroke\\n had predicted.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Louisa, I\\'d say your\\n only fault is the way you keep\\n wigglin\\' your shoulders up \\'n\\'\\n down. Why\\'n\\'sha try holdin\\' \\'em\\n straight?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought it made me look\\n sexy,\" the redhead said petulantly.\\n\\n\\n \"Just be yourself, gal,\" Spencer\\n drawled, jabbing her intimately\\n with a fat elbow, \"and\\n you\\'ll qualify.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Me, me,\" the blonde with a\\n feather cut was insisting. \"What\\n is wrong with me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re perfect, sweetheart,\"\\n he told her, taking her hand.\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, come on,\" she pleaded.\\n \"Everyone tells me I chew gum\\n with my mouth open. Don\\'t you\\n hate that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naw, that\\'s part of your\\n charm,\" Spencer assured her.\\n\\n\\n \"How \\'bout me, sugar,\" asked\\n the girl with the coal black hair.\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, you\\'re perfect, too. You\\n are all perfect. I\\'ve never seen\\n such a collection of dolls as parade\\n around this here city.\\n C\\'mon, kids—how \\'bout another\\n round?\"\\n\\n\\n But the dolls had apparently\\n lost interest in him. They got up\\n one by one and walked out of the\\n bar. Pembroke took his rum and\\n tonic and moved over to Spencer\\'s\\n booth.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay if I join you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" said the fat man.\\n \"Wonder what the hell got into\\n those babes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You said they were perfect.\\n They know they\\'re not. You\\'ve\\n got to be rough with them in this\\n town,\" said Pembroke. \"That\\'s\\n all they want from us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mister, you\\'ve been doing\\n some thinkin\\', I can see,\" said\\n Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.\\n \"Maybe you\\'ve figured\\n out where we are.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Your bet\\'s as good as mine,\"\\n said Pembroke. \"It\\'s not Wellington,\\n and it\\'s not Brisbane, and\\n it\\'s not Long Beach, and it\\'s not\\n Tahiti. There are a lot of places\\n it\\'s not. But where the hell it is,\\n you tell me.\\n\\n\\n \"And, by the way,\" he added,\\n \"I hope you like it in Puerto\\n Pacifico. Because there isn\\'t any\\n place to go from here and there\\n isn\\'t any way to get there if\\n there were.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pardon me, gentlemen, but\\n I\\'m Joe Valencia, manager of the\\n hotel. I would be very grateful if\\n you would give me a few minutes\\n of honest criticism.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, no, not you, too,\" groaned\\n Spencer. \"Look, Joe, what\\'s\\n the gag?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are newcomers, Mr.\\n Spencer,\" Valencia explained.\\n \"You are therefore in an excellent\\n position to point out our\\n faults as you see them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, so what?\" demanded\\n Spencer. \"I\\'ve got more important\\n things to do than to worry\\n about your troubles. You look\\n okay to me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Valencia,\" said Pembroke.\\n \"I\\'ve noticed that you\\n walk with a very slight limp. If\\n you have a bad leg, I should\\n think you would do better to develop\\n a more pronounced limp.\\n Otherwise, you may appear to\\n be self-conscious about it.\"\\nSpencer opened his mouth to\\n protest, but saw with amazement\\n that it was exactly this that\\n Valencia was seeking. Pembroke\\n was amused at his companion\\'s\\n reaction but observed that Spencer\\n still failed to see the point.\\n\\n\\n \"Also, there is a certain effeminateness\\n in the way in which\\n you speak,\" said Pembroke. \"Try\\n to be a little more direct, a little\\n more brusque. Speak in a monotone.\\n It will make you more acceptable.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you so much,\" said the\\n manager. \"There is much food\\n for thought in what you have\\n said, Mr. Pembroke. However,\\n Mr. Spencer, your value has failed\\n to prove itself. You have only\\n yourself to blame. Cooperation is\\n all we require of you.\"\\n\\n\\n Valencia left. Spencer ordered\\n another martini. Neither he nor\\n Pembroke spoke for several minutes.\\n\\n\\n \"Somebody\\'s crazy around\\n here,\" the fat man muttered\\n after a few moments. \"Is it me,\\n Frank?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. You just don\\'t belong\\n here, in this particular place,\"\\n said Pembroke thoughtfully.\\n \"You\\'re the wrong type. But they\\n couldn\\'t know that ahead of time.\\n The way they operate it\\'s a\\n pretty hit-or-miss operation. But\\n they don\\'t care one bit about us,\\n Spencer. Consider the men who\\n went down with the ship. That\\n was just part of the game.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What the hell are you sayin\\'?\"\\n asked Spencer in disbelief.\\n \"You figure\\nthey\\nsunk the ship?\\n Valencia and the waitress and\\n the three babes? Ah, come on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s what you think that will\\n determine what you do, Spencer.\\n I suggest you change your attitude;\\n play along with them for a\\n few days till the picture becomes\\n a little clearer to you. We\\'ll talk\\n about it again then.\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose and started out\\n of the bar. A policeman entered\\n and walked directly to Spencer\\'s\\n table. Loitering at the juke box,\\n Pembroke overheard the conversation.\\n\\n\\n \"You Spencer?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" said the fat\\n man sullenly.\\n\\n\\n \"What don\\'t you like about\\n me? The\\ntruth\\n, buddy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah, hell! Nothin\\' wrong\\n with you at all, and nothin\\'ll\\n make me say there is,\" said Spencer.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re the guy, all right. Too\\n bad, Mac,\" said the cop.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke heard the shots as\\n he strolled casually out into the\\n brightness of the hotel lobby.\\n While he waited for the elevator,\\n he saw them carrying the body\\n into the street. How many others,\\n he wondered, had gone out on\\n their backs during their first day\\n in Puerto Pacifico?\\nPembroke shaved, showered,\\n and put on the new suit and shirt\\n he had bought. Then he took\\n Mary Ann, the woman he had\\n met on the beach, out to dinner.\\n She would look magnificent even\\n when fully clothed, he decided,\\n and the pale chartreuse gown she\\n wore hardly placed her in that\\n category. Her conversation seemed\\n considerably more normal\\n after the other denizens of\\n Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had\\n listened to that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n After eating they danced for\\n an hour, had a few more drinks,\\n then went to Pembroke\\'s room.\\n He still knew nothing about her\\n and had almost exhausted his\\n critical capabilities, but not once\\n had she become annoyed with\\n him. She seemed to devour every\\n factual point of imperfection\\n about herself that Pembroke\\n brought to her attention. And,\\n fantastically enough, she actually\\n appeared to have overcome every\\n little imperfection he had been\\n able to communicate to her.\\n\\n\\n It was in the privacy of his\\n room that Pembroke became\\n aware of just how perfect, physically,\\n Mary Ann was. Too perfect.\\n No freckles or moles anywhere\\n on the visible surface of\\n her brown skin, which was more\\n than a mere sampling. Furthermore,\\n her face and body were\\n meticulously symmetrical. And\\n she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.\\n\\n\\n \"With so many beautiful\\n women in Puerto Pacifico,\" said\\n Pembroke probingly, \"I find it\\n hard to understand why there are\\n so few children.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, children are decorative,\\n aren\\'t they,\" said Mary Ann. \"I\\n do wish there were more of\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not have a couple of\\n your own?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, they\\'re only given to maternal\\n types. I\\'d never get one.\\n Anyway, I won\\'t ever marry,\"\\n she said. \"I\\'m the paramour\\n type.\"\\n\\n\\n It was obvious that the liquor\\n had been having some effect.\\n Either that, or she had a basic\\n flaw of loquacity that no one else\\n had discovered. Pembroke decided\\n he would have to cover his\\n tracks carefully.\\n\\n\\n \"What type am I?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Silly, you\\'re real. You\\'re not\\n a type at all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mary Ann, I love you very\\n much,\" Pembroke murmured,\\n gambling everything on this one\\n throw. \"When you go to Earth\\n I\\'ll miss you terribly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, but you\\'ll be dead by\\n then,\" she pouted. \"So I mustn\\'t\\n fall in love with you. I don\\'t want\\n to be miserable.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I pretended I was one of\\n you, if I left on the boat with\\n you, they\\'d let me go to Earth\\n with you. Wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I\\'m sure they would.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mary Ann, you have two\\n other flaws I feel I should mention.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes? Please tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"In the first place,\" said Pembroke,\\n \"you should be willing to\\n fall in love with me even if it\\n will eventually make you unhappy.\\n How can you be the paramour\\n type if you refuse to fall in\\n love foolishly? And when you\\n have fallen in love, you should be\\n very loyal.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll try,\" she said unsurely.\\n \"What else?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The other thing is that, as\\n my mistress, you must never\\n mention me to anyone. It would\\n place me in great danger.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll never tell anyone anything\\n about you,\" she promised.\\n\\n\\n \"Now try to love me,\" Pembroke\\n said, drawing her into his\\n arms and kissing with little\\n pleasure the smooth, warm perfection\\n of her tanned cheeks.\\n \"Love me my sweet, beautiful,\\n affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.\"\\n\\n\\n Making love to Mary Ann was\\n something short of ecstasy. Not\\n for any obvious reason, but because\\n of subtle little factors that\\n make a woman a woman. Mary\\n Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did\\n not perspire. Mary Ann did not\\n fatigue gradually but all at once.\\n Mary Ann breathed regularly\\n under all circumstances. Mary\\n Ann talked and talked and talked.\\n But then, Mary Ann was not\\n a human being.\\n\\n\\n When she left the hotel at midnight,\\n Pembroke was quite sure\\n that she understood his plan and\\n that she was irrevocably in love\\n with him. Tomorrow might bring\\n his death, but it might also ensure\\n his escape. After forty-two\\n years of searching for a passion,\\n for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank\\n Pembroke had at last found his.\\n Earth and the human race that\\n peopled it. And Mary Ann would\\n help him to save it.\\nThe next morning Pembroke\\n talked to Valencia about hunting.\\n He said that he planned to go\\n shooting out on the desert which\\n surrounded the city. Valencia\\n told him that there were no living\\n creatures anywhere but in\\n the city. Pembroke said he was\\n going out anyway.\\n\\n\\n He picked up Mary Ann at her\\n apartment and together they\\n went to a sporting goods store.\\n As he guessed there was a goodly\\n selection of firearms, despite the\\n fact that there was nothing to\\n hunt and only a single target\\n range within the city. Everything,\\n of course, had to be just\\n like Earth. That, after all, was\\n the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.\\n\\n\\n By noon they had rented a\\n jeep and were well away from\\n the city. Pembroke and Mary\\n Ann took turns firing at the paper\\n targets they had purchased. At\\n twilight they headed back to the\\n city. On the outskirts, where the\\n sand and soil were mixed and no\\n footprints would be left, Pembroke\\n hopped off. Mary Ann\\n would go straight to the police\\n and report that Pembroke had attacked\\n her and that she had shot\\n him. If necessary, she would conduct\\n the authorities to the place\\n where they had been target\\n shooting, but would be unable to\\n locate the spot where she had\\n buried the body. Why had she\\n buried it? Because at first she\\n was not going to report the incident.\\n She was frightened. It\\n was not airtight, but there would\\n probably be no further investigation.\\n And they certainly would\\n not prosecute Mary Ann for killing\\n an Earthman.\\n\\n\\n Now Pembroke had himself to\\n worry about. The first step was\\n to enter smoothly into the new\\n life he had planned. It wouldn\\'t\\n be so comfortable as the previous\\n one, but should be considerably\\n safer. He headed slowly for the\\n \"old\" part of town, aging his\\n clothes against buildings and\\n fences as he walked. He had already\\n torn the collar of the shirt\\n and discarded his belt. By morning\\n his beard would grow to\\n blacken his face. And he would\\n look weary and hungry and aimless.\\n Only the last would be a deception.\\nTwo weeks later Pembroke\\n phoned Mary Ann. The police\\n had accepted her story without\\n even checking. And when, when\\n would she be seeing him again?\\n He had aroused her passion and\\n no amount of long-distance love\\n could requite it. Soon, he assured\\n her, soon.\\n\\n\\n \"Because, after all, you do owe\\n me something,\" she added.\\n\\n\\n And that was bad because it\\n sounded as if she had been giving\\n some womanly thought to the situation.\\n A little more of that and\\n she might go to the police again,\\n this time for vengeance.\\n\\n\\n Twice during his wanderings\\n Pembroke had seen the corpses\\n of Earthmen being carted out of\\n buildings. They had to be Earthmen\\n because they bled. Mary Ann\\n had admitted that she did not.\\n There would be very few Earthmen\\n left in Puerto Pacifico, and\\n it would be simple enough to locate\\n him if he were reported as\\n being on the loose. There was\\n no out but to do away with Mary\\n Ann.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke headed for the\\n beach. He knew she invariably\\n went there in the afternoon. He\\n loitered around the stalls where\\n hot dogs and soft drinks were\\n sold, leaning against a post in\\n the hot sun, hat pulled down over\\n his forehead. Then he noticed\\n that people all about him were\\n talking excitedly. They were discussing\\n a ship. It was leaving\\n that afternoon. Anyone who\\n could pass the interview would\\n be sent to Earth.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke had visited the\\n docks every day, without being\\n able to learn when the great\\n exodus would take place. Yet he\\n was certain the first lap would be\\n by water rather than by spaceship,\\n since no one he had talked\\n to in the city had ever heard of\\n spaceships. In fact, they knew\\n very little about their masters.\\n\\n\\n Now the ship had arrived and\\n was to leave shortly. If there was\\n any but the most superficial examination,\\n Pembroke would no\\n doubt be discovered and exterminated.\\n But since no one seemed\\n concerned about anything but his\\n own speech and behavior, he assumed\\n that they had all qualified\\n in every other respect. The reason\\n for transporting Earth People\\n to this planet was, of course,\\n to apply a corrective to any of\\n the Pacificos\\' aberrant mannerisms\\n or articulation. This was\\n the polishing up phase.\\nPembroke began hobbling toward\\n the docks. Almost at once\\n he found himself face to face\\n with Mary Ann. She smiled happily\\n when she recognized him.\\nThat\\nwas a good thing.\\n\\n\\n \"It is a sign of poor breeding\\n to smile at tramps,\" Pembroke\\n admonished her in a whisper.\\n \"Walk on ahead.\"\\n\\n\\n She obeyed. He followed. The\\n crowd grew thicker. They neared\\n the docks and Pembroke saw that\\n there were now set up on the\\n roped-off wharves small interviewing\\n booths. When it was\\n their turn, he and Mary Ann\\n each went into separate ones.\\n Pembroke found himself alone in\\n the little room.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw that there was\\n another entity in his presence\\n confined beneath a glass dome. It\\n looked rather like a groundhog\\n and had seven fingers on each of\\n its six limbs. But it was larger\\n and hairier than the glass one\\n he had seen at the gift store.\\n With four of its limbs it tapped\\n on an intricate keyboard in front\\n of it.\\n\\n\\n \"What is your name?\" queried\\n a metallic voice from a speaker\\n on the wall.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m Jerry Newton. Got no\\n middle initial,\" Pembroke said in\\n a surly voice.\\n\\n\\n \"Occupation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I work a lot o\\' trades. Fisherman,\\n fruit picker, fightin\\' range\\n fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.\\n You name it. Been out of\\n work for a long time now,\\n though. Goin\\' on five months.\\n These here are hard times, no\\n matter what they say.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you think of the\\n Chinese situation?\" the voice inquired.\\n\\n\\n \"Which situation\\'s \\'at?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s Seattle?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Seattle? State o\\' Washington.\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went for about five\\n minutes. Then he was told he\\n had qualified as a satisfactory\\n surrogate for a mid-twentieth\\n century American male, itinerant\\n type.\\n\\n\\n \"You understand your mission,\\n Newton?\" the voice asked. \"You\\n are to establish yourself on\\n Earth. In time you will receive\\n instructions. Then you will attack.\\n You will not see us, your\\n masters, again until the atmosphere\\n has been sufficiently chlorinated.\\n In the meantime, serve\\n us well.\"\\n\\n\\n He stumbled out toward the\\n docks, then looked about for\\n Mary Ann. He saw her at last\\n behind the ropes, her lovely face\\n in tears.\\n\\n\\n Then she saw him. Waving\\n frantically, she called his name\\n several times. Pembroke mingled\\n with the crowd moving toward\\n the ship, ignoring her. But still\\n the woman persisted in her\\n shouting.\\n\\n\\n Sidling up to a well-dressed\\n man-about-town type, Pembroke\\n winked at him and snickered.\\n\\n\\n \"You Frank?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Hell, no. But some poor\\n punk\\'s sure red in the face, I\\'ll\\n bet,\" the man-about-town said\\n with a chuckle. \"Those high-strung\\n paramour types always\\n raising a ruckus. They never do\\n pass the interview. Don\\'t know\\n why they even make \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.\\n\\n\\n \"Ambulance squad,\" Pembroke\\'s\\n companion explained.\\n \"They\\'ll take her off to the buggy\\n house for a few days and bring\\n her out fresh and ignorant as the\\n day she was assembled. Don\\'t\\n know why they keep making \\'em,\\n as I say. But I guess there\\'s a\\n call for that type up there on\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, I reckon there is at\\n that,\" said Pembroke, snickering\\n again as he moved away from the\\n other. \"And why not? Hey?\\n Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n Pembroke went right on hating\\n himself, however, till the\\n night he was deposited in a field\\n outside of Ensenada, broke but\\n happy, with two other itinerant\\n types. They separated in San\\n Diego, and it was not long before\\n Pembroke was explaining to the\\n police how he had drifted far\\n from the scene of the sinking of\\n the\\nElena Mia\\non a piece of\\n wreckage, and had been picked\\n up by a Chilean trawler. How he\\n had then made his way, with\\n much suffering, up the coast to\\n California. Two days later, his\\n identity established and his circumstances\\n again solvent, he was\\n headed for Los Angeles to begin\\n his save-Earth campaign.\\nNow, seated at his battered\\n desk in the shabby rented office\\n over Lemark\\'s Liquors, Pembroke\\n gazed without emotion at\\n the two demolished Pacificos that\\n lay sprawled one atop the other\\n in the corner. His watch said\\n one-fifteen. The man from the\\n FBI should arrive soon.\\n\\n\\n There were footsteps on the\\n stairs for the third time that\\n day. Not the brisk, efficient steps\\n of a federal official, but the hesitant,\\n self-conscious steps of a\\n junior clerk type.\\n\\n\\n Pembroke rose as the young\\n man appeared at the door. His\\n face was smooth, unpimpled,\\n clean-shaven, without sweat on a\\n warm summer afternoon.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you Dr. Von Schubert?\"\\n the newcomer asked, peering into\\n the room. \"You see, I\\'ve got a\\n problem—\"\\n\\n\\n The four shots from Pembroke\\'s\\n pistol solved his problem\\n effectively. Pembroke tossed his\\n third victim onto the pile, then\\n opened a can of lager, quaffing\\n it appreciatively. Seating himself\\n once more, he leaned back in\\n the chair, both feet upon the\\n desk.\\n\\n\\n He would be out of business\\n soon, once the FBI agent had got\\n there. Pembroke was only in it to\\n get the proof he would need to\\n convince people of the truth of\\n his tale. But in the meantime he\\n allowed himself to admire the\\n clipping of the newspaper ad he\\n had run in all the Los Angeles\\n papers for the past week. The\\n little ad that had saved mankind\\n from God-knew-what insidious\\n menace. It read:\\nARE YOU IMPERFECT?\\nLET DR.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\\nA FILBERT IS A NUT\\nBY RICK RAPHAEL\\nThat the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized\\n psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!\\nIllustrated by Freas\\nMiss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the\\n shoulder. \"You\\'re doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you\\n have finished.\"\\n\\n\\n The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile\\n and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.\\n\\n\\n Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the\\n other patients working at the long tables in the hospital\\'s arts and\\n crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,\\n lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers\\'\\n prospects for the pennant.\\n\\n\\n Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were\\n seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental\\n institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main\\n buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere\\n complex of buildings that housed the main wards.\\n\\n\\n The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word\\n of advice here, and a suggestion there.\\n\\n\\n She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of\\n clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he\\n carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.\\n\\n\\n \"And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?\" Miss Abercrombie asked.\\n\\n\\n The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the\\n patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to\\n draw away from the woman.\\n\\n\\n \"We mustn\\'t be antisocial, Mr. Funston,\" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,\\n but firmly. \"You\\'ve been coming along famously and you must remember to\\n answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very\\n complicated.\" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.\\n\\n\\n Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.\\n\\n\\n Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.\\n\\n\\n \"Atom bomb.\"\\n\\n\\n A puzzled look crossed the therapist\\'s face. \"Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I\\n thought you said an \\'atom bomb.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did,\" Funston murmured.\\n\\n\\n Safely behind the patient\\'s back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so\\n slightly. \"Why that\\'s very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative\\n thought. I\\'m very pleased.\"\\n\\n\\n She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.\\n\\n\\n A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood\\n up and stretched.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, fellows,\" he called out, \"time to go back. Put up your\\n things.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs\\n being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one\\n more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless\\n smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.\\n\\n\\n At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit\\n of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he\\n clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and\\n then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk\\n back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a\\n quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the\\n warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.\\n\\n\\n Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart\\n book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she\\n made short, precise notes on the day\\'s work accomplished by each\\n patient.\\n\\n\\n At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball\\n and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through\\n the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted\\n lengthily in her chart book.\\n\\n\\n When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked\\n the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.\\n\\n\\n The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile\\n to the main administration building where her car was parked.\\n\\n\\n As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the\\n barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills\\n towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant\\n came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients\\'\\n mess hall.\\nThe sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the\\n ward lights winked out at nine o\\'clock, leaving just a single light\\n burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm\\n hills.\\n\\n\\n At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat\\n up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and\\n occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.\\n Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that\\n sheltered the deserted crafts building.\\n\\n\\n He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\\n\\n\\n The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark\\n shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.\\n\\n\\n An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck\\n the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a\\n thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild\\n screams of the frightened and demented patients.\\n\\n\\n It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling\\n lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.\\n\\n\\n Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a\\n small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been\\n the arts and crafts building.\\n\\n\\n Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed\\n with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried\\n through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the\\n explosion.\\n\\n\\n None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a\\n welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.\\n\\n\\n The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the\\n surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units\\n from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the\\n still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.\\n\\n\\n Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy\\n radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and\\n equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.\\n\\n\\n At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of\\n Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI\\n agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.\\n\\n\\n At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast\\n crater.\\n\\n\\n In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s impossible and unbelievable,\" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the\\n fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of\\n experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.\\n \"How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,\" one of the haggard AEC\\n men offered timidly. \"Not over three kilotons.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t care if it was the size of a peanut,\" Thurgood screamed. \"How\\n did it get here?\"\\n\\n\\n A military intelligence agent spoke up. \"If we knew, sir, we wouldn\\'t be\\n standing around here. We don\\'t know, but the fact remains that it WAS an\\n atomic explosion.\"\\n\\n\\n Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything\\n that was in that building?\" Thurgood swept his hand in the general\\n direction of the blast crater.\\n\\n\\n \"Colonel, I\\'ve told you a dozen times,\" the hospital administrator said\\n with exasperation, \"this was our manual therapy room. We gave our\\n patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,\\n through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems\\n that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints\\n and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then\\n Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,\"\\n Thurgood sighed. \"I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this\\n morning blew it to hell and gone.\\n\\n\\n \"And I\\'ve got to find out how it happened.\"\\n\\n\\n Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little\\n doctor.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s that girl you said was in charge of this place?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ve already called for Miss Abercrombie and she\\'s on her way here\\n now,\" the doctor snapped.\\nOutside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved\\n around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining\\n every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one\\n time.\\n\\n\\n A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the\\n tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.\\n\\n\\n She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned\\n expression.\\n\\n\\n \"He did make an atom bomb,\" she cried.\\n\\n\\n Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped\\n forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.\\n\\n\\n At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff\\n room of the hospital administration building.\\n\\n\\n Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the\\n edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist\\n on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie\\'s chart book bounce with\\n every beat.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s ridiculous,\" Thurgood roared. \"We\\'ll all be the laughingstocks of\\n the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You\\n are all nuts. You\\'re in the right place, but count me out.\"\\n\\n\\n At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the\\n broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,\\n strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered\\n weariness.\\n\\n\\n \"Miss Abercrombie,\" one of the physicists spoke up gently, \"you say that\\n after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at\\n Funston\\'s work?\"\\n\\n\\n The therapist nodded unhappily.\\n\\n\\n \"And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,\" the physicist\\n continued, \"there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m positive that\\'s all there was in it,\" Miss Abercrombie cried.\\n\\n\\n There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC\\n man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They\\n conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.\\n\\n\\n \"That seems to settle it, colonel. We\\'ve got to give this Funston\\n another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.\"\\n\\n\\n Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you crazy?\" he screamed. \"You want to get us all thrown into this\\n filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they\\n ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,\\n anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with\\n the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid\\'s modeling clay?\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'d crucify us, that\\'s what they\\'d do!\"\\n\\n\\n At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer\\'s\\n greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an\\n officer\\'s cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small\\n side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes\\n later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and\\n drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of\\n the runway with propellers turning.\\n\\n\\n Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to\\n secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard\\n the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss\\n Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into\\n the night skies.\\n\\n\\n The plane landed the next morning at the AEC\\'s atomic testing grounds in\\n the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack\\n miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and\\n military men huddled around a small wooden table.\\n\\n\\n There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of\\n modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off\\n Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary\\n Miss Abercrombie.\\n\\n\\n \"Now you\\'re positive this is just about the same amount and the same\\n kind of clay he used before?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the\\n hospital,\" she replied, \"and it\\'s the same amount.\"\\n\\n\\n Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with\\n Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.\\n\\n\\n She smiled at Funston.\\n\\n\\n \"Now isn\\'t this nice, Mr. Funston,\" she said. \"These nice men have\\n brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the\\n one you made for me yesterday.\"\\n\\n\\n A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus\\' face. He looked around the\\n shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he\\n walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp\\n clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation\\'s top\\n atomic scientists watched in fascination.\\n\\n\\n His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay\\n parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in\\n front of him.\\n\\n\\n Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the\\n table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she\\n glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston\\n finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense\\n silence.\\n\\n\\n \"Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow.\" She\\n looked at the men and nodded her head.\\n\\n\\n The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus\\' side as he put the upper lid of\\n clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him\\n from the shack.\\n\\n\\n There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The\\n experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere\\n and cameras clicking.\\n\\n\\n For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child\\'s clay\\n and photographed it from every angle.\\n\\n\\n Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down\\n range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of\\n stony-faced military policemen.\\n\\n\\n \"I told you this whole thing was asinine,\" Thurgood snarled as the\\n scientific teams trooped into the bunker.\\n\\n\\n Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open\\n door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden\\n cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\\n\\n\\n A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit\\n the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door\\n slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.\\nSix hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait\\n jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.\\n Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the\\n Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.\\n\\n\\n In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were\\n closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his\\n baker\\'s dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted\\n across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in\\n a neatly-tied bundle.\\n\\n\\n In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling\\n glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,\" the general\\n said coldly, \"but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane\\n asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit\\n there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic\\n devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.\"\\n\\n\\n The general paused.\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships\\n out of sponge rubber?\" the general added bitingly.\\n\\n\\n In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama\\n of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.\\n\\n\\n In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the\\n Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,\\n the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space\\n on a tail of flame.\\nTHE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nSome men just haven\\'t got good sense. They just can\\'t seem to\\n learn the most fundamental things. Like when there\\'s no use\\n trying—when it\\'s time to give up because it\\'s hopeless....\\nThe meteor, a pebble, a little larger than a match head, traveled\\n through space and time since it came into being. The light from the star\\n that died when the meteor was created fell on Earth before the first\\n lungfish ventured from the sea.\\n\\n\\n In its last instant, the meteor fell on the Moon. It was impeded by\\n Evans\\' tractor.\\n\\n\\n It drilled a small, neat hole through the casing of the steam turbine,\\n and volitized upon striking the blades. Portions of the turbine also\\n volitized; idling at eight thousand RPM, it became unstable. The shaft\\n tried to tie itself into a knot, and the blades, damaged and undamaged\\n were spit through the casing. The turbine again reached a stable state,\\n that is, stopped. Permanently stopped.\\n\\n\\n It was two days to sunrise, where Evans stood.\\n\\n\\n It was just before sunset on a spring evening in September in Sydney.\\n The shadow line between day and night could be seen from the Moon to be\\n drifting across Australia.\\n\\n\\n Evans, who had no watch, thought of the time as a quarter after\\n Australia.\\n\\n\\n Evans was a prospector, and like all prospectors, a sort of jackknife\\n geologist, selenologist, rather. His tractor and equipment cost two\\n hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand was paid for. The\\n rest was promissory notes and grubstake shares. When he was broke, which\\n was usually, he used his tractor to haul uranium ore and metallic sodium\\n from the mines at Potter\\'s dike to Williamson Town, where the rockets\\n landed.\\n\\n\\n When he was flush, he would prospect for a couple of weeks. Once he\\n followed a stampede to Yellow Crater, where he thought for a while that\\n he had a fortune in chromium. The chromite petered out in a month and a\\n half, and he was lucky to break even.\\n\\n\\n Evans was about three hundred miles east of Williamson Town, the site of\\n the first landing on the Moon.\\n\\n\\n Evans was due back at Williamson Town at about sunset, that is, in about\\n sixteen days. When he saw the wrecked turbine, he knew that he wouldn\\'t\\n make it. By careful rationing, he could probably stretch his food out to\\n more than a month. His drinking water—kept separate from the water in\\n the reactor—might conceivably last just as long. But his oxygen was too\\n carefully measured; there was a four-day reserve. By diligent\\n conservation, he might make it last an extra day. Four days\\n reserve—plus one is five—plus sixteen days normal supply equals\\n twenty-one days to live.\\n\\n\\n In seventeen days he might be missed, but in seventeen days it would be\\n dark again, and the search for him, if it ever began, could not begin\\n for thirteen more days. At the earliest it would be eight days too late.\\n\"Well, man, \\'tis a fine spot you\\'re in now,\" he told himself.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s find out how bad it is indeed,\" he answered. He reached for the\\n light switch and tried to turn it on. The switch was already in the \"on\"\\n position.\\n\\n\\n \"Batteries must be dead,\" he told himself.\\n\\n\\n \"What batteries?\" he asked. \"There\\'re no batteries in here, the power\\n comes from the generator.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why isn\\'t the generator working, man?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n He thought this one out carefully. The generator was not turned by the\\n main turbine, but by a small reciprocating engine. The steam, however,\\n came from the same boiler. And the boiler, of course, had emptied itself\\n through the hole in the turbine. And the condenser, of course—\\n\\n\\n \"The condenser!\" he shouted.\\n\\n\\n He fumbled for a while, until he found a small flashlight. By the light\\n of this, he reinspected the steam system, and found about three gallons\\n of water frozen in the condenser. The condenser, like all condensers,\\n was a device to convert steam into water, so that it could be reused in\\n the boiler. This one had a tank and coils of tubing in the center of a\\n curved reflector that was positioned to radiate the heat of the steam\\n into the cold darkness of space. When the meteor pierced the turbine,\\n the water in the condenser began to boil. This boiling lowered the\\n temperature, and the condenser demonstrated its efficiency by quickly\\n freezing the water in the tank.\\n\\n\\n Evans sealed the turbine from the rest of the steam system by closing\\n the shut-off valves. If there was any water in the boiler, it would\\n operate the engine that drove the generator. The water would condense in\\n the condenser, and with a little luck, melt the ice in there. Then, if\\n the pump wasn\\'t blocked by ice, it would return the water to the boiler.\\n\\n\\n But there was no water in the boiler. Carefully he poured a cup of his\\n drinking water into a pipe that led to the boiler, and resealed the\\n pipe. He pulled on a knob marked \"Nuclear Start/Safety Bypass.\" The\\n water that he had poured into the boiler quickly turned into steam, and\\n the steam turned the generator briefly.\\n\\n\\n Evans watched the lights flicker and go out, and he guessed what the\\n trouble was.\\n\\n\\n \"The water, man,\" he said, \"there is not enough to melt the ice in the\\n condenser.\"\\n\\n\\n He opened the pipe again and poured nearly a half-gallon of water into\\n the boiler. It was three days\\' supply of water, if it had been carefully\\n used. It was one day\\'s supply if used wastefully. It was ostentatious\\n luxury for a man with a month\\'s supply of water and twenty-one days to\\n live.\\n\\n\\n The generator started again, and the lights came on. They flickered as\\n the boiler pressure began to fail, but the steam had melted some of the\\n ice in the condenser, and the water pump began to function.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, man,\" he breathed, \"there\\'s a light to die by.\"\\nThe sun rose on Williamson Town at about the same time it rose on Evans.\\n It was an incredibly brilliant disk in a black sky. The stars next to\\n the sun shone as brightly as though there were no sun. They might have\\n appeared to waver slightly, if they were behind outflung corona flares.\\n If they did, no one noticed. No one looked toward the sun without dark\\n filters.\\n\\n\\n When Director McIlroy came into his office, he found it lighted by the\\n rising sun. The light was a hot, brilliant white that seemed to pierce\\n the darkest shadows of the room. He moved to the round window, screening\\n his eyes from the light, and adjusted the polaroid shade to maximum\\n density. The sun became an angry red brown, and the room was dark again.\\n McIlroy decreased the density again until the room was comfortably\\n lighted. The room felt stuffy, so he decided to leave the door to the\\n inner office open.\\n\\n\\n He felt a little guilty about this, because he had ordered that all\\n doors in the survey building should remain closed except when someone\\n was passing through them. This was to allow the air-conditioning system\\n to function properly, and to prevent air loss in case of the highly\\n improbable meteor damage. McIlroy thought that on the whole, he was\\n disobeying his own orders no more flagrantly than anyone else in the\\n survey.\\n\\n\\n McIlroy had no illusions about his ability to lead men. Or rather, he\\n did have one illusion; he thought that he was completely unfit as a\\n leader. It was true that his strictest orders were disobeyed with\\n cheerful contempt, but it was also true his mildest requests were\\n complied with eagerly and smoothly.\\n\\n\\n Everyone in the survey except McIlroy realized this, and even he\\n accepted this without thinking about it. He had fallen into the habit of\\n suggesting mildly anything that he wanted done, and writing orders he\\n didn\\'t particularly care to have obeyed.\\n\\n\\n For example, because of an order of his stating that there would be no\\n alcoholic beverages within the survey building, the entire survey was\\n assured of a constant supply of home-made, but passably good liquor.\\n Even McIlroy enjoyed the surreptitious drinking.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning, Mr. McIlroy,\" said Mrs. Garth, his secretary. Morning to\\n Mrs. Garth was simply the first four hours after waking.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning indeed,\" answered McIlroy. Morning to him had no meaning\\n at all, but he thought in the strictest sense that it would be morning\\n on the Moon for another week.\\n\\n\\n \"Has the power crew set up the solar furnace?\" he asked. The solar\\n furnace was a rough parabola of mirrors used to focus the sun\\'s heat on\\n anything that it was desirable to heat. It was used mostly, from sun-up\\n to sun-down, to supplement the nuclear power plant.\\n\\n\\n \"They went out about an hour ago,\" she answered, \"I suppose that\\'s what\\n they were going to do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Very good, what\\'s first on the schedule?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A Mr. Phelps to see you,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"How do you do, Mr. Phelps,\" McIlroy greeted him.\\n\\n\\n \"Good afternoon,\" Mr. Phelps replied. \"I\\'m here representing the\\n Merchants\\' Bank Association.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine,\" McIlroy said, \"I suppose you\\'re here to set up a bank.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, I just got in from Muroc last night, and I\\'ve been going\\n over the assets of the Survey Credit Association all morning.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll certainly be glad to get them off my hands,\" McIlroy said. \"I hope\\n they\\'re in good order.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There doesn\\'t seem to be any profit,\" Mr. Phelps said.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s par for a nonprofit organization,\" said McIlroy. \"But we\\'re\\n amateurs, and we\\'re turning this operation over to professionals. I\\'m\\n sure it will be to everyone\\'s satisfaction.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know this seems like a silly question. What day is this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" said McIlroy, \"that\\'s not so silly. I don\\'t know either.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mrs. Garth,\" he called, \"what day is this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why, September, I think,\" she answered.\\n\\n\\n \"I mean what\\nday\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know, I\\'ll call the observatory.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a pause.\\n\\n\\n \"They say what day where?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Greenwich, I guess, our official time is supposed to be Greenwich Mean\\n Time.\"\\n\\n\\n There was another pause.\\n\\n\\n \"They say it\\'s September fourth, one thirty\\n a.m.\\n \"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, there you are,\" laughed McIlroy, \"it isn\\'t that time doesn\\'t mean\\n anything here, it just doesn\\'t mean the same thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. Phelps joined the laughter. \"Bankers\\' hours don\\'t mean much, at any\\n rate,\" he said.\\nThe power crew was having trouble with the solar furnace. Three of the\\n nine banks of mirrors would not respond to the electric controls, and\\n one bank moved so jerkily that it could not be focused, and it\\n threatened to tear several of the mirrors loose.\\n\\n\\n \"What happened here?\" Spotty Cade, one of the electrical technicians\\n asked his foreman, Cowalczk, over the intercommunications radio. \"I\\'ve\\n got about a hundred pinholes in the cables out here. It\\'s no wonder they\\n don\\'t work.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Meteor shower,\" Cowalczk answered, \"and that\\'s not half of it. Walker\\n says he\\'s got a half dozen mirrors cracked or pitted, and Hoffman on\\n bank three wants you to replace a servo motor. He says the bearing was\\n hit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When did it happen?\" Cade wanted to know.\\n\\n\\n \"Must have been last night, at least two or three days ago. All of \\'em\\n too small for Radar to pick up, and not enough for Seismo to get a\\n rumble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sounds pretty bad.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Could have been worse,\" said Cowalczk.\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wasn\\'t anybody out in it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, Chuck,\" another technician, Lehman, broke in, \"you could maybe get\\n hurt that way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I doubt it,\" Cowalczk answered, \"most of these were pinhead size, and\\n they wouldn\\'t go through a suit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It would take a pretty big one to damage a servo bearing,\" Cade\\n commented.\\n\\n\\n \"That could hurt,\" Cowalczk admitted, \"but there was only one of them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean only one hit our gear,\" Lehman said. \"How many missed?\"\\n\\n\\n Nobody answered. They could all see the Moon under their feet. Small\\n craters overlapped and touched each other. There was—except in the\\n places that men had obscured them with footprints—not a square foot\\n that didn\\'t contain a crater at least ten inches across, there was not a\\n square inch without its half-inch crater. Nearly all of these had been\\n made millions of years ago, but here and there, the rim of a crater\\n covered part of a footprint, clear evidence that it was a recent one.\\nAfter the sun rose, Evans returned to the lava cave that he had been\\n exploring when the meteor hit. Inside, he lifted his filter visor, and\\n found that the light reflected from the small ray that peered into the\\n cave door lighted the cave adequately. He tapped loose some white\\n crystals on the cave wall with his geologist\\'s hammer, and put them into\\n a collector\\'s bag.\\n\\n\\n \"A few mineral specimens would give us something to think about, man.\\n These crystals,\" he said, \"look a little like zeolites, but that can\\'t\\n be, zeolites need water to form, and there\\'s no water on the Moon.\"\\n\\n\\n He chipped a number of other crystals loose and put them in bags. One of\\n them he found in a dark crevice had a hexagonal shape that puzzled him.\\n\\n\\n One at a time, back in the tractor, he took the crystals out of the bags\\n and analyzed them as well as he could without using a flame which would\\n waste oxygen. The ones that looked like zeolites were zeolites, all\\n right, or something very much like it. One of the crystals that he\\n thought was quartz turned out to be calcite, and one of the ones that he\\n was sure could be nothing but calcite was actually potassium nitrate.\\n\"Well, now,\" he said, \"it\\'s probably the largest natural crystal of\\n potassium nitrate that anyone has ever seen. Man, it\\'s a full inch\\n across.\"\\n\\n\\n All of these needed water to form, and their existence on the Moon\\n puzzled him for a while. Then he opened the bag that had contained the\\n unusual hexagonal crystals, and the puzzle resolved itself. There was\\n nothing in the bag but a few drops of water. What he had taken to be a\\n type of rock was ice, frozen in a niche that had never been warmed by\\n the sun.\\nThe sun rose to the meridian slowly. It was a week after sunrise. The\\n stars shone coldly, and wheeled in their slow course with the sun. Only\\n Earth remained in the same spot in the black sky. The shadow line crept\\n around until Earth was nearly dark, and then the rim of light appeared\\n on the opposite side. For a while Earth was a dark disk in a thin halo,\\n and then the light came to be a crescent, and the line of dawn began to\\n move around Earth. The continents drifted across the dark disk and into\\n the crescent. The people on Earth saw the full moon set about the same\\n time that the sun rose.\\nNickel Jones was the captain of a supply rocket. He made trips from and\\n to the Moon about once a month, carrying supplies in and metal and ores\\n out. At this time he was visiting with his old friend McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"I swear, Mac,\" said Jones, \"another season like this, and I\\'m going\\n back to mining.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I thought you were doing pretty well,\" said McIlroy, as he poured two\\n drinks from a bottle of Scotch that Jones had brought him.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, the money I like, but I will say that I\\'d have more if I didn\\'t\\n have to fight the union and the Lunar Trade Commission.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy had heard all of this before. \"How\\'s that?\" he asked politely.\\n\\n\\n \"You may think it\\'s myself running the ship,\" Jones started on his\\n tirade, \"but it\\'s not. The union it is that says who I can hire. The\\n union it is that says how much I must pay, and how large a crew I need.\\n And then the Commission ...\" The word seemed to give Jones an unpleasant\\n taste in his mouth, which he hurriedly rinsed with a sip of Scotch.\\n\\n\\n \"The Commission,\" he continued, making the word sound like an obscenity,\\n \"it is that tells me how much I can charge for freight.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy noticed that his friend\\'s glass was empty, and he quietly filled\\n it again.\\n\\n\\n \"And then,\" continued Jones, \"if I buy a cargo up here, the Commission\\n it is that says what I\\'ll sell it for. If I had my way, I\\'d charge only\\n fifty cents a pound for freight instead of the dollar forty that the\\n Commission insists on. That\\'s from here to Earth, of course. There\\'s no\\n profit I could make by cutting rates the other way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not?\" asked McIlroy. He knew the answer, but he liked to listen to\\n the slightly Welsh voice of Jones.\\n\\n\\n \"Near cost it is now at a dollar forty. But what sense is there in\\n charging the same rate to go either way when it takes about a seventh of\\n the fuel to get from here to Earth as it does to get from there to\\n here?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What good would it do to charge fifty cents a pound?\" asked McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"The nickel, man, the tons of nickel worth a dollar and a half on Earth,\\n and not worth mining here; the low-grade ores of uranium and vanadium,\\n they need these things on Earth, but they can\\'t get them as long as it\\n isn\\'t worth the carrying of them. And then, of course, there\\'s the water\\n we haven\\'t got. We could afford to bring more water for more people, and\\n set up more distilling plants if we had the money from the nickel.\\n\\n\\n \"Even though I say it who shouldn\\'t, two-eighty a quart is too much to\\n pay for water.\"\\n\\n\\n Both men fell silent for a while. Then Jones spoke again:\\n\\n\\n \"Have you seen our friend Evans lately? The price of chromium has gone\\n up, and I think he could ship some of his ore from Yellow Crater at a\\n profit.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s out prospecting again. I don\\'t expect to see him until sun-down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll likely see him then. I won\\'t be loaded for another week and a\\n half. Can\\'t you get in touch with him by radio?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He isn\\'t carrying one. Most of the prospectors don\\'t. They claim that a\\n radio that won\\'t carry beyond the horizon isn\\'t any good, and one that\\n will bounce messages from Earth takes up too much room.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if I don\\'t see him, you let him know about the chromium.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Anything to help another Welshman, is that the idea?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, protection it is that a poor Welshman needs from all the English\\n and Scots. Speaking of which—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, of course,\" McIlroy grinned as he refilled the glasses.\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSlainte, McIlroy, bach.\\n\" \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mHealth, McIlroy, man.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n \"\\nSlainte mhor, bach.\\n\" \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mGreat Health, man.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe sun was halfway to the horizon, and Earth was a crescent in the sky\\n when Evans had quarried all the ice that was available in the cave. The\\n thought grew on him as he worked that this couldn\\'t be the only such\\n cave in the area. There must be several more bubbles in the lava flow.\\n\\n\\n Part of his reasoning proved correct. That is, he found that by\\n chipping, he could locate small bubbles up to an inch in diameter, each\\n one with its droplet of water. The average was about one per cent of the\\n volume of each bubble filled with ice.\\n\\n\\n A quarter of a mile from the tractor, Evans found a promising looking\\n mound of lava. It was rounded on top, and it could easily be the dome of\\n a bubble. Suddenly, Evans noticed that the gauge on the oxygen tank of\\n his suit was reading dangerously near empty. He turned back to his\\n tractor, moving as slowly as he felt safe in doing. Running would use up\\n oxygen too fast. He was halfway there when the pressure warning light\\n went on, and the signal sounded inside his helmet. He turned on his\\n ten-minute reserve supply, and made it to the tractor with about five\\n minutes left. The air purifying apparatus in the suit was not as\\n efficient as the one in the tractor; it wasted oxygen. By using the suit\\n so much, Evans had already shortened his life by several days. He\\n resolved not to leave the tractor again, and reluctantly abandoned his\\n plan to search for a large bubble.\\nThe sun stood at half its diameter above the horizon. The shadows of the\\n mountains stretched out to touch the shadows of the other mountains. The\\n dawning line of light covered half of Earth, and Earth turned beneath\\n it.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk itched under his suit, and the sweat on his face prickled\\n maddeningly because he couldn\\'t reach it through his helmet. He pushed\\n his forehead against the faceplate of his helmet and rubbed off some of\\n the sweat. It didn\\'t help much, and it left a blurred spot in his\\n vision. That annoyed him.\\n\\n\\n \"Is everyone clear of the outlet?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"All clear,\" he heard Cade report through the intercom.\\n\\n\\n \"How come we have to blow the boilers now?\" asked Lehman.\\n\\n\\n \"Because I say so,\" Cowalczk shouted, surprised at his outburst and\\n ashamed of it. \"Boiler scale,\" he continued, much calmer. \"We\\'ve got to\\n clean out the boilers once a year to make sure the tubes in the reactor\\n don\\'t clog up.\" He squinted through his dark visor at the reactor\\n building, a gray concrete structure a quarter of a mile distant. \"It\\n would be pretty bad if they clogged up some night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Pressure\\'s ten and a half pounds,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Right, let her go,\" said Cowalczk.\\n\\n\\n Cade threw a switch. In the reactor building, a relay closed. A motor\\n started turning, and the worm gear on the motor opened a valve on the\\n boiler. A stream of muddy water gushed into a closed vat. When the vat\\n was about half full, the water began to run nearly clear. An electric\\n eye noted that fact and a light in front of Cade turned on. Cade threw\\n the switch back the other way, and the relay in the reactor building\\n opened. The motor turned and the gears started to close the valve. But a\\n fragment of boiler scale held the valve open.\\n\\n\\n \"Valve\\'s stuck,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Open it and close it again,\" said Cowalczk. The sweat on his forehead\\n started to run into his eyes. He banged his hand on his faceplate in an\\n unconscious attempt to wipe it off. He cursed silently, and wiped it off\\n on the inside of his helmet again. This time, two drops ran down the\\n inside of his faceplate.\\n\\n\\n \"Still don\\'t work,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n \"Keep trying,\" Cowalczk ordered. \"Lehman, get a Geiger counter and come\\n with me, we\\'ve got to fix this thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Lehman and Cowalczk, who were already suited up started across to the\\n reactor building. Cade, who was in the pressurized control room without\\n a suit on, kept working the switch back and forth. There was light that\\n indicated when the valve was open. It was on, and it stayed on, no\\n matter what Cade did.\\n\\n\\n \"The vat pressure\\'s too high,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n \"Let me know when it reaches six pounds,\" Cowalczk requested. \"Because\\n it\\'ll probably blow at seven.\"\\n\\n\\n The vat was a light plastic container used only to decant sludge out of\\n the water. It neither needed nor had much strength.\\n\\n\\n \"Six now,\" said Cade.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman stopped halfway to the reactor. The vat bulged and\\n ruptured. A stream of mud gushed out and boiled dry on the face of the\\n Moon. Cowalczk and Lehman rushed forward again.\\n\\n\\n They could see the trickle of water from the discharge pipe. The motor\\n turned the valve back and forth in response to Cade\\'s signals.\\n\"What\\'s going on out there?\" demanded McIlroy on the intercom.\\n\\n\\n \"Scale stuck in the valve,\" Cowalczk answered.\\n\\n\\n \"Are the reactors off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. Vat blew. Shut up! Let me work, Mac!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" McIlroy said, realizing that this was no time for officials.\\n \"Let me know when it\\'s fixed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Geiger\\'s off scale,\" Lehman said.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re probably O.K. in these suits for an hour,\" Cowalczk answered. \"Is\\n there a manual shut-off?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not that I know of,\" Lehman answered. \"What about it, Cade?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t think so,\" Cade said. \"I\\'ll get on the blower and rouse out an\\n engineer.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K., but keep working that switch.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I checked the line as far as it\\'s safe,\" said Lehman. \"No valve.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" Cowalczk said. \"Listen, Cade, are the injectors still on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah. There\\'s still enough heat in these reactors to do some damage.\\n I\\'ll cut \\'em in about fifteen minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve found the trouble,\" Lehman said. \"The worm gear\\'s loose on its\\n shaft. It\\'s slipping every time the valve closes. There\\'s not enough\\n power in it to crush the scale.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right,\" Cowalczk said. \"Cade, open the valve wide. Lehman, hand me that\\n pipe wrench!\"\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk hit the shaft with the back of the pipe wrench, and it broke at\\n the motor bearing.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman fitted the pipe wrench to the gear on the valve, and\\n turned it.\\n\\n\\n \"Is the light off?\" Cowalczk asked.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Cade answered.\\n\\n\\n \"Water\\'s stopped. Give us some pressure, we\\'ll see if it holds.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Twenty pounds,\" Cade answered after a couple of minutes.\\n\\n\\n \"Take her up to ... no, wait, it\\'s still leaking,\" Cowalczk said. \"Hold\\n it there, we\\'ll open the valve again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" said Cade. \"An engineer here says there\\'s no manual cutoff.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like Hell,\" said Lehman.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman opened the valve again. Water spurted out, and\\n dwindled as they closed the valve.\\n\\n\\n \"What did you do?\" asked Cade. \"The light went out and came on again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Check that circuit and see if it works,\" Cowalczk instructed.\\n\\n\\n There was a pause.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s O.K.,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n Cowalczk and Lehman opened and closed the valve again.\\n\\n\\n \"Light is off now,\" Cade said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Cowalczk, \"take the pressure up all the way, and we\\'ll see\\n what happens.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eight hundred pounds,\" Cade said, after a short wait.\\n\\n\\n \"Good enough,\" Cowalczk said. \"Tell that engineer to hold up a while, he\\n can fix this thing as soon as he gets parts. Come on, Lehman, let\\'s get\\n out of here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I\\'m glad that\\'s over,\" said Cade. \"You guys had me worried for a\\n while.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Think we weren\\'t worried?\" Lehman asked. \"And it\\'s not over.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" Cade asked. \"Oh, you mean the valve servo you two bashed up?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Lehman, \"I mean the two thousand gallons of water that we\\n lost.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Two thousand?\" Cade asked. \"We only had seven hundred gallons reserve.\\n How come we can operate now?\"\\n\\n\\n \"We picked up twelve hundred from the town sewage plant. What with using\\n the solar furnace as a radiator, we can make do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, God, I suppose this means water rationing again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re probably right, at least until the next rocket lands in a couple\\n of weeks.\"\\nPROSPECTOR FEARED LOST ON MOON\\n\\n\\n IPP Williamson Town, Moon, Sept. 21st. Scientific survey director\\n McIlroy released a statement today that Howard Evans, a prospector\\n is missing and presumed lost. Evans, who was apparently exploring\\n the Moon in search of minerals was due two days ago, but it was\\n presumed that he was merely temporarily delayed.\\n\\n\\n Evans began his exploration on August 25th, and was known to be\\n carrying several days reserve of oxygen and supplies. Director\\n McIlroy has expressed a hope that Evans will be found before his\\n oxygen runs out.\\n\\n\\n Search parties have started from Williamson Town, but telescopic\\n search from Palomar and the new satellite observatory are hindered\\n by the fact that Evans is lost on the part of the Moon which is now\\n dark. Little hope is held for radio contact with the missing man as\\n it is believed he was carrying only short-range,\\n intercommunications equipment. Nevertheless, receivers are ...\\n\\n\\n Captain Nickel Jones was also expressing a hope: \"Anyway, Mac,\" he was\\n saying to McIlroy, \"a Welshman knows when his luck\\'s run out. And never\\n a word did he say.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Like as not, you\\'re right,\" McIlroy replied, \"but if I know Evans, he\\'d\\n never say a word about any forebodings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, happen I might have a bit of Welsh second sight about me, and it\\n tells me that Evans will be found.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy chuckled for the first time in several days. \"So that\\'s the\\n reason you didn\\'t take off when you were scheduled,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, yes,\" Jones answered. \"I thought that it might happen that a\\n rocket would be needed in the search.\"\\n\\n\\n The light from Earth lighted the Moon as the Moon had never lighted\\n Earth. The great blue globe of Earth, the only thing larger than the\\n stars, wheeled silently in the sky. As it turned, the shadow of sunset\\n crept across the face that could be seen from the Moon. From full Earth,\\n as you might say, it moved toward last quarter.\\n\\n\\n The rising sun shone into Director McIlroy\\'s office. The hot light\\n formed a circle on the wall opposite the window, and the light became\\n more intense as the sun slowly pulled over the horizon. Mrs. Garth\\n walked into the director\\'s office, and saw the director sleeping with\\n his head cradled in his arms on the desk. She walked softly to the\\n window and adjusted the shade to darken the office. She stood looking at\\n McIlroy for a moment, and when he moved slightly in his sleep, she\\n walked softly out of the office.\\n\\n\\n A few minutes later she was back with a cup of coffee. She placed it in\\n front of the director, and shook his shoulder gently.\\n\\n\\n \"Wake up, Mr. McIlroy,\" she said, \"you told me to wake you at sunrise,\\n and there it is, and here\\'s Mr. Phelps.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy woke up slowly. He leaned back in his chair and stretched. His\\n neck was stiff from sleeping in such an awkward position.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Morning, Mr. Phelps,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good morning,\" Phelps answered, dropping tiredly into a chair.\\n\\n\\n \"Have some coffee, Mr. Phelps,\" said Mrs. Garth, handing him a cup.\\n\\n\\n \"Any news?\" asked McIlroy.\\n\\n\\n \"About Evans?\" Phelps shook his head slowly. \"Palomar called in a few\\n minutes back. Nothing to report and the sun was rising there. Australia\\n will be in position pretty soon. Several observatories there. Then\\n Capetown. There are lots of observatories in Europe, but most of them\\n are clouded over. Anyway the satellite observatory will be in position\\n by the time Europe is.\"\\n\\n\\n McIlroy was fully awake. He glanced at Phelps and wondered how long it\\n had been since he had slept last. More than that, McIlroy wondered why\\n this banker, who had never met Evans, was losing so much sleep about\\n finding him. It began to dawn on McIlroy that nearly the whole\\n population of Williamson Town was involved, one way or another, in the\\n search.\\n\\n\\n The director turned to ask Phelps about this fact, but the banker was\\n slumped in his chair, fast asleep with his coffee untouched.\\n\\n\\n It was three hours later that McIlroy woke Phelps.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ve found the tractor,\" McIlroy said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" Phelps mumbled, and then as comprehension came; \"That\\'s fine!\\n That\\'s just line! Is Evans—?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t tell yet. They spotted the tractor from the satellite\\n observatory. Captain Jones took off a few minutes ago, and he\\'ll report\\n back as soon as he lands. Hadn\\'t you better get some sleep?\"\\nEvans was carrying a block of ice into the tractor when he saw the\\n rocket coming in for a landing. He dropped the block and stood waiting.\\n When the dust settled from around the tail of the rocket, he started to\\n run forward. The air lock opened, and Evans recognized the vacuum suited\\n figure of Nickel Jones.\\n\\n\\n \"Evans, man!\" said Jones\\' voice in the intercom. \"Alive you are!\"\\n\\n\\n \"A Welshman takes a lot of killing,\" Evans answered.\\nLater, in Evans\\' tractor, he was telling his story:\\n\\n\\n \"... And I don\\'t know how long I sat there after I found the water.\" He\\n looked at the Goldburgian device he had made out of wire and tubing.\\n \"Finally I built this thing. These caves were made of lava. They must\\n have been formed by steam some time, because there\\'s a floor of ice in\\n all of \\'em.\\n\\n\\n \"The idea didn\\'t come all at once, it took a long time for me to\\n remember that water is made out of oxygen and hydrogen. When I\\n remembered that, of course, I remembered that it can be separated with\\n electricity. So I built this thing.\\n\\n\\n \"It runs an electric current through water, lets the oxygen loose in the\\n room, and pipes the hydrogen outside. It doesn\\'t work automatically, of\\n course, so I run it about an hour a day. My oxygen level gauge shows how\\n long.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re a genius, man!\" Jones exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Evans answered, \"a Welshman, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, then,\" said Jones, \"are you ready to start back?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Back?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, it was to rescue you that I came.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t need rescuing, man,\" Evans said.\\n\\n\\n Jones stared at him blankly.\\n\\n\\n \"You might let me have some food,\" Evans continued. \"I\\'m getting short\\n of that. And you might have someone send out a mechanic with parts to\\n fix my tractor. Then maybe you\\'ll let me use your radio to file my\\n claim.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Claim?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure, man, I\\'ve thousands of tons of water here. It\\'s the richest mine\\n on the Moon!\"\\n\\n\\n THE END\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

And all they got\\n for their patience was the\\n biggest surprise since David\\n clobbered Goliath.\\n\"\\n Let\\n me put it this way,\"\\n Conners said paternally.\\n \"We expect a certain amount of\\n decorum from our Washington\\n news correspondents, and that\\'s\\n all I\\'m asking for.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the\\n chair opposite his employer\\'s\\n desk, chewed on his knuckles\\n and said nothing. One part of\\n his mind wanted him to play it\\n cagey, to behave the way the\\n newspaper wanted him to behave,\\n to protect the cozy Washington\\n assignment he had waited\\n four years to get. But another\\n part of him, a rebel part,\\n wanted him to stay on the trail\\n of the story he felt sure was\\n about to break.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t mean to make trouble,\\n Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.\\n \"It just seemed strange, all\\n these exchanges of couriers in\\n the past two days. I couldn\\'t\\n help thinking something was\\n up.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Even if that\\'s true, we\\'ll\\n hear about it through the usual\\n channels,\" Conners frowned.\\n \"But getting a senator\\'s secretary\\n drunk to obtain information—well,\\n that\\'s not only indiscreet,\\n Bridges. It\\'s downright\\n dirty.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn\\'t take\\nthat\\nkind of advantage, Mr.\\n Conners. Not that she wasn\\'t a\\n toothsome little dish ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just thank your lucky stars\\n that it didn\\'t go any further.\\n And from now on—\" He waggled\\n a finger at him. \"Watch\\n your step.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry got up and ambled to the\\n door. But he turned before leaving\\n and said:\\n\\n\\n \"By the way. What do\\nyou\\nthink is going on?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I haven\\'t the faintest idea.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t kid me, Mr. Conners.\\n Think it\\'s war?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'ll be all, Bridges.\"\\nThe reporter closed the door\\n behind him, and then strolled\\n out of the building into the sunlight.\\n\\n\\n He met Ruskin, the fat little\\n AP correspondent, in front of\\n the Pan-American Building on\\n Constitution Avenue. Ruskin\\n was holding the newspaper that\\n contained the gossip-column\\n item which had started the\\n whole affair, and he seemed\\n more interested in the romantic\\n rather than political implications.\\n As he walked beside him,\\n he said:\\n\\n\\n \"So what really happened,\\n pal? That Greta babe really let\\n down her hair?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s your decorum?\"\\n Jerry growled.\\n\\n\\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she\\'s\\n quite a dame, all right. I think\\n they ought to get the Secret\\n Service to guard her. She really\\n fills out a size 10, don\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you\\n have a low mind. For a week,\\n this town has been acting like\\n the\\n39 Steps\\n, and all you can\\n think about is dames. What\\'s\\n the matter with you? Where\\n will you be when the big mushroom\\n cloud comes?\"\\n\\n\\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin\\n sighed. \"What a way to get\\n radioactive.\"\\n\\n\\n They split off a few blocks\\n later, and Jerry walked until he\\n came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;\\n Grill, a favorite hangout of the\\n local journalists. There were\\n three other newsmen at the bar,\\n and they gave him snickering\\n greetings. He took a small table\\n in the rear and ate his meal in\\n sullen silence.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t the newsmen\\'s jibes\\n that bothered him; it was the\\n certainty that something of\\n major importance was happening\\n in the capitol. There had\\n been hourly conferences at the\\n White House, flying visits by\\n State Department officials, mysterious\\n conferences involving\\n members of the Science Commission.\\n So far, the byword\\n had been secrecy. They knew\\n that Senator Spocker, chairman\\n of the Congressional Science\\n Committee, had been involved\\n in every meeting, but Senator\\n Spocker was unavailable. His\\n secretary, however, was a little\\n more obliging ...\\n\\n\\n Jerry looked up from his\\n coffee and blinked when he saw\\n who was coming through the\\n door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did\\n every other patron, but for different\\n reasons. Greta Johnson\\n had that effect upon men. Even\\n the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored\\n suit didn\\'t hide\\n her outrageously feminine qualities.\\n\\n\\n She walked straight to his\\n table, and he stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"They told me you might be\\n here,\" she said, breathing hard.\\n \"I just wanted to thank you for\\n last night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Greta—\"\\nWham!\\nHer hand, small and\\n delicate, felt like a slab of lead\\n when it slammed into his cheek.\\n She left a bruise five fingers\\n wide, and then turned and stalked\\n out.\\nHe ran after her, the restaurant\\n proprietor shouting about\\n the unpaid bill. It took a rapid\\n dog-trot to reach her side.\\n\\n\\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.\\n \"You don\\'t understand about\\n last night. It wasn\\'t the way\\n that lousy columnist said—\"\\n\\n\\n She stopped in her tracks.\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t have minded so\\n much if you\\'d gotten me drunk.\\n But to\\nuse\\nme, just to get a\\n story—\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I\\'m a\\nreporter\\n, damn it.\\n It\\'s my job. I\\'d do it again if\\n I thought you knew anything.\"\\n\\n\\n She was pouting now. \"Well,\\n how do you suppose I feel,\\n knowing you\\'re only interested\\n in me because of the Senator?\\n Anyway, I\\'ll probably lose my\\n job, and then you won\\'t have\\nany\\nuse for me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said\\n sadly.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you\\n won\\'t want to see me any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did I say that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It just won\\'t be any use.\\n We\\'ll always have this thing between\\n us.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him for a moment,\\n and then touched his\\n bruised cheek with a tender,\\n motherly gesture.\\n\\n\\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,\\n and then sighed. \"Oh,\\n well. I guess there\\'s no use\\n fighting it. Maybe if I\\ndid\\ntell\\n you what I know, we could act\\nhuman\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Greta!\"\\n\\n\\n \"But if you print one\\nword\\nof it, Jerry Bridges, I\\'ll never\\n speak to you again!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking\\n her arm, \"you can trust me like\\n a brother.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s\\nnot\\nthe idea,\" Greta\\n said stiffly.\\n\\n\\n In a secluded booth at the rear\\n of a restaurant unfrequented by\\n newsmen, Greta leaned forward\\n and said:\\n\\n\\n \"At first, they thought it was\\n another sputnik.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWho\\ndid?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The State Department, silly.\\n They got reports from the observatories\\n about another sputnik\\n being launched by the Russians.\\n Only the Russians denied\\n it. Then there were joint meetings,\\n and nobody could figure\\n out\\nwhat\\nthe damn thing was.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said\\n dizzily. \"You mean to tell me\\n there\\'s another of those metal\\n moons up there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s not a moon. That\\'s\\n the big point. It\\'s a spaceship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A\\nwhat\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said\\n coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They\\n have been in contact with it now\\n for about three days, and they\\'re\\n thinking of calling a plenary\\n session of the UN just to figure\\n out what to do about it. The\\n only hitch is, Russia doesn\\'t\\n want to wait that long, and is\\n asking for a hurry-up summit\\n meeting to make a decision.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A decision about what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"About the Venusians, of\\n course.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I\\n think you\\'re still a little woozy\\n from last night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t be silly. The spaceship\\'s\\n from Venus; they\\'ve already\\n established that. And the\\n people on it—I\\nguess\\nthey\\'re\\n people—want to know if they\\n can land their delegate.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Their what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Their delegate. They came\\n here for some kind of conference,\\n I guess. They know about\\n the UN and everything, and\\n they want to take part. They\\n say that with all the satellites\\n being launched, that our affairs\\n are\\ntheir\\naffairs, too. It\\'s kind\\n of confusing, but that\\'s what\\n they say.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean these Venusians\\n speak English?\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Russian. And French.\\n And German. And everything I\\n guess. They\\'ve been having\\n radio talks with practically\\n every country for the past three\\n days. Like I say, they want to\\n establish diplomatic relations\\n or something. The Senator\\n thinks that if we don\\'t agree,\\n they might do something drastic,\\n like blow us all up. It\\'s kind\\n of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re taking it mighty\\n calm,\" he said ironically.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, how else can I take it?\\n I\\'m not even supposed to\\nknow\\nabout it, except that the Senator\\n is so careless about—\" She\\n put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,\\n dear, now you\\'ll really think I\\'m\\n terrible.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Terrible? I think you\\'re\\n wonderful!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you promise not to print\\n it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t I say I wouldn\\'t?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you\\'re\\n a liar sometimes, Jerry. I\\'ve noticed\\n that about you.\"\\nThe press secretary\\'s secretary,\\n a massive woman with\\n gray hair and impervious to\\n charm, guarded the portals of\\n his office with all the indomitable\\n will of the U. S. Marines.\\n But Jerry Bridges tried.\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t understand, Lana,\"\\n he said. \"I don\\'t want to\\nsee\\nMr.\\n Howells. I just want you to\\ngive\\nhim something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"My name\\'s not Lana, and I\\ncan\\'t\\ndeliver any messages.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But this is something he\\nwants\\nto see.\" He handed her\\n an envelope, stamped URGENT.\\n \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I\\'ll\\n buy you the flashiest pair of\\n diamond earrings in Washington.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" the woman said,\\n thawing slightly. \"I\\ncould\\ndeliver\\n it with his next batch of mail.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When will that be?\"\\n\\n\\n \"In an hour. He\\'s in a terribly\\n important meeting right\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve got some mail right\\n there. Earrings and a bracelet\\n to match.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him with exasperation,\\n and then gathered up\\n a stack of memorandums and\\n letters, his own envelope atop\\n it. She came out of the press\\n secretary\\'s office two minutes\\n later with Howells himself, and\\n Howells said: \"You there,\\n Bridges. Come in here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\\nsir\\n!\" Jerry said, breezing\\n by the waiting reporters\\n with a grin of triumph.\\n\\n\\n There were six men in the\\n room, three in military uniform.\\n Howells poked the envelope towards\\n Jerry, and snapped:\\n\\n\\n \"This note of yours. Just what\\n do you think it means?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know better than I do,\\n Mr. Howells. I\\'m just doing my\\n job; I think the public has a\\n right to know about this spaceship\\n that\\'s flying around—\"\\nHis words brought an exclamation\\n from the others. Howells\\n sighed, and said:\\n\\n\\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don\\'t make\\n it easy for us. It\\'s our opinion\\n that secrecy is essential, that\\n leakage of the story might cause\\n panic. Since you\\'re the only unauthorized\\n person who knows of\\n it, we have two choices. One of\\n them is to lock you up.\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry swallowed hard.\\n\\n\\n \"The other is perhaps more\\n practical,\" Howells said. \"You\\'ll\\n be taken into our confidence, and\\n allowed to accompany those officials\\n who will be admitted to the\\n landing site. But you will\\nnot\\nbe\\n allowed to relay the story to the\\n press until such a time as\\nall\\ncorrespondents are informed.\\n That won\\'t give you a \\'scoop\\' if\\n that\\'s what you call it, but you\\'ll\\n be an eyewitness. That should\\n be worth something.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s worth a lot,\" Jerry said\\n eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t thank me, I\\'m not doing\\n you any\\npersonal\\nfavor. Now\\n about the landing tonight—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean the spaceship\\'s\\n coming down?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers\\n conference was held this\\n morning, and a decision was\\n reached to accept the delegate.\\n Landing instructions are being\\n given at Los Alamos, and the\\n ship will presumably land\\n around midnight tonight. There\\n will be a jet leaving Washington\\n Airport at nine, and you\\'ll be\\n on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself\\n in custody.\"\\nThe USAF jet transport\\n wasn\\'t the only secrecy-shrouded\\n aircraft that took off that evening\\n from Washington Airport.\\n But Jerry Bridges, sitting in\\n the rear seat flanked by two\\n Sphinx-like Secret Service men,\\n knew that he was the only passenger\\n with non-official status\\n aboard.\\n\\n\\n It was only a few minutes\\n past ten when they arrived at\\n the air base at Los Alamos. The\\n desert sky was cloudy and starless,\\n and powerful searchlights\\n probed the thick cumulus. There\\n were sleek, purring black autos\\n waiting to rush the air passengers\\n to some unnamed destination.\\n They drove for twenty\\n minutes across a flat ribbon of\\n desert road, until Jerry sighted\\n what appeared to be a circle of\\n newly-erected lights in the middle\\n of nowhere. On the perimeter,\\n official vehicles were parked\\n in orderly rows, and four USAF\\n trailer trucks were in evidence,\\n their radarscopes turning slowly.\\n There was activity everywhere,\\n but it was well-ordered\\n and unhurried. They had done a\\n good job of keeping the excitement\\n contained.\\n\\n\\n He was allowed to leave the\\n car and stroll unescorted. He\\n tried to talk to some of the\\n scurrying officials, but to no\\n avail. Finally, he contented\\n himself by sitting on the sand,\\n his back against the grill of a\\n staff car, smoking one cigarette\\n after another.\\n\\n\\n As the minutes ticked off, the\\n activity became more frenetic\\n around him. Then the pace slowed,\\n and he knew the appointed\\n moment was approaching. Stillness\\n returned to the desert, and\\n tension was a tangible substance\\n in the night air.\\n\\n\\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\\n\\n\\n The searchlights converged\\n in an intricate pattern.\\n\\n\\n Then the clouds seemed to\\n part!\\n\\n\\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice\\n shouted. And in a moment, the\\n calm was shattered. At first, he\\n saw nothing. A faint roar was\\n started in the heavens, and it\\n became a growl that increased\\n in volume until even the shouting\\n voices could no longer be\\n heard. Then the crisscrossing\\n lights struck metal, glancing off\\n the gleaming body of a descending\\n object. Larger and larger\\n the object grew, until it assumed\\n the definable shape of a squat\\n silver funnel, falling in a perfect\\n straight line towards the center\\n of the light-ringed area. When it\\n hit, a dust cloud obscured it from\\n sight.\\nA loudspeaker blared out an\\n unintelligible order, but its message\\n was clear. No one moved\\n from their position.\\n\\n\\n Finally, a three-man team,\\n asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped\\n out from the ring of spectators.\\n They carried geiger counters\\n on long poles before them.\\n\\n\\n Jerry held his breath as they\\n approached the object; only\\n when they were yards away did\\n he appreciate its size. It wasn\\'t\\n large; not more than fifteen feet\\n in total circumference.\\n\\n\\n One of the three men waved\\n a gloved hand.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s okay,\" a voice breathed\\n behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\\n\\n\\n Slowly, the ring of spectators\\n closed tighter. They were twenty\\n yards from the ship when the\\n voice spoke to them.\\n\\n\\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it\\n said, and then repeated the\\n phrase in six languages. \"The\\n ship you see is a Venusian Class\\n 7 interplanetary rocket, built\\n for one-passenger. It is clear of\\n all radiation, and is perfectly\\n safe to approach. There is a\\n hatch which may be opened by\\n an automatic lever in the side.\\n Please open this hatch and remove\\n the passenger.\"\\n\\n\\n An Air Force General whom\\n Jerry couldn\\'t identify stepped\\n forward. He circled the ship\\n warily, and then said something\\n to the others. They came closer,\\n and he touched a small lever on\\n the silvery surface of the funnel.\\n\\n\\n A door slid open.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s a box!\" someone said.\\n\\n\\n \"A crate—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!\\n Lend a hand here—\"\\n\\n\\n A trio came forward and\\n hoisted the crate out of the ship.\\n Then the voice spoke again;\\n Jerry deduced that it must have\\n been activated by the decreased\\n load of the ship.\\n\\n\\n \"Please open the crate. You\\n will find our delegate within.\\n We trust you will treat him\\n with the courtesy of an official\\n emissary.\"\\n\\n\\n They set to work on the crate,\\n its gray plastic material giving\\n in readily to the application of\\n their tools. But when it was\\n opened, they stood aside in\\n amazement and consternation.\\n\\n\\n There were a variety of metal\\n pieces packed within, protected\\n by a filmy packing material.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general\\n said. \"Here\\'s a book—\"\\n\\n\\n He picked up a gray-bound\\n volume, and opened its cover.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'Instructions for assembling\\n Delegate,\\'\" he read aloud.\\n \"\\'First, remove all parts and\\n arrange them in the following\\n order. A-1, central nervous system\\n housing. A-2 ...\\'\" He looked\\n up. \"It\\'s an instruction book,\"\\n he whispered. \"We\\'re supposed\\n to\\nbuild\\nthe damn thing.\"\\nThe Delegate, a handsomely\\n constructed robot almost eight\\n feet tall, was pieced together\\n some three hours later, by a\\n team of scientists and engineers\\n who seemed to find the Venusian\\n instructions as elementary as a\\n blueprint in an Erector set. But\\n simple as the job was, they were\\n obviously impressed by the\\n mechanism they had assembled.\\n It stood impassive until they\\n obeyed the final instruction.\\n \"Press Button K ...\"\\n\\n\\n They found button K, and\\n pressed it.\\n\\n\\n The robot bowed.\\n\\n\\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it\\n said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.\\n \"Now if you will please\\n escort me to the meeting\\n place ...\"\\nIt wasn\\'t until three days\\n after the landing that Jerry\\n Bridges saw the Delegate again.\\n Along with a dozen assorted\\n government officials, Army officers,\\n and scientists, he was\\n quartered in a quonset hut in\\n Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,\\n after seventy-two frustrating\\n hours, he was escorted by Marine\\n guard into New York City.\\n No one told him his destination,\\n and it wasn\\'t until he saw the\\n bright strips of light across the\\n face of the United Nations\\n building that he knew where the\\n meeting was to be held.\\n\\n\\n But his greatest surprise was\\n yet to come. The vast auditorium\\n which housed the general\\n assembly was filled to its capacity,\\n but there were new faces\\n behind the plaques which designated\\n the member nations.\\n He couldn\\'t believe his eyes at\\n first, but as the meeting got\\n under way, he knew that it was\\n true. The highest echelons of the\\n world\\'s governments were represented,\\n even—Jerry gulped\\n at the realization—Nikita Khrushchev\\n himself. It was a summit\\n meeting such as he had never\\n dreamed possible, a summit\\n meeting without benefit of long\\n foreign minister\\'s debate. And\\n the cause of it all, a placid,\\n highly-polished metal robot, was\\n seated blithely at a desk which\\n bore the designation:\\nVENUS.\\n\\n\\n The robot delegate stood up.\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the\\n microphone, and the great men\\n at the council tables strained to\\n hear the translator\\'s version\\n through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,\\n I thank you for your\\n prompt attention. I come as a\\n Delegate from a great neighbor\\n planet, in the interests of peace\\n and progress for all the solar\\n system. I come in the belief that\\n peace is the responsibility of individuals,\\n of nations, and now\\n of worlds, and that each is dependent\\n upon the other. I speak\\n to you now through the electronic\\n instrumentation which\\n has been created for me, and I\\n come to offer your planet not\\n merely a threat, a promise, or\\n an easy solution—but a challenge.\"\\n\\n\\n The council room stirred.\\n\\n\\n \"Your earth satellites have\\n been viewed with interest by the\\n astronomers of our world, and\\n we foresee the day when contact\\n between our planets will be commonplace.\\n As for ourselves, we\\n have hitherto had little desire\\n to explore beyond our realm,\\n being far too occupied with internal\\n matters. But our isolation\\n cannot last in the face of\\n your progress, so we believe that\\n we must take part in your\\n affairs.\\n\\n\\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.\\n Continue your struggle of ideas,\\n compete with each other for the\\n minds of men, fight your bloodless\\n battles, if you know no\\n other means to attain progress.\\n But do all this\\nwithout\\nunleashing\\n the terrible forces of power\\n now at your command. Once\\n unleashed, these forces may or\\n may not destroy all that you\\n have gained. But we, the scientists\\n of Venus, promise you this—that\\n on the very day your conflict\\n deteriorates into heedless\\n violence, we will not stand by\\n and let the ugly contagion\\n spread. On that day, we of\\n Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,\\n and relentlessly—to destroy\\n your world completely.\"\\n\\n\\n Again, the meeting room exploded\\n in a babble of languages.\\n\\n\\n \"The vessel which brought me\\n here came as a messenger of\\n peace. But envision it, men of\\n Earth, as a messenger of war.\\n Unstoppable, inexorable, it may\\n return, bearing a different Delegate\\n from Venus—a Delegate of\\n Death, who speaks not in words,\\n but in the explosion of atoms.\\n Think of thousands of such Delegates,\\n fired from a vantage\\n point far beyond the reach of\\n your retaliation. This is the\\n promise and the challenge that\\n will hang in your night sky from\\n this moment forward. Look at\\n the planet Venus, men of Earth,\\n and see a Goddess of Vengeance,\\n poised to wreak its wrath upon\\n those who betray the peace.\"\\n\\n\\n The Delegate sat down.\\nFour days later, a mysterious\\n explosion rocked the quiet sands\\n of Los Alamos, and the Venus\\n spacecraft was no more. Two\\n hours after that, the robot delegate,\\n its message delivered, its\\n mission fulfilled, requested to be\\n locked inside a bombproof\\n chamber. When the door was\\n opened, the Delegate was an exploded\\n ruin.\\n\\n\\n The news flashed with lightning\\n speed over the world, and\\n Jerry Bridges\\' eyewitness accounts\\n of the incredible event\\n was syndicated throughout the\\n nation. But his sudden celebrity\\n left him vaguely unsatisfied.\\n\\n\\n He tried to explain his feeling\\n to Greta on his first night back\\n in Washington. They were in his\\n apartment, and it was the first\\n time Greta had consented to pay\\n him the visit.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, what\\'s\\nbothering\\nyou?\"\\n Greta pouted. \"You\\'ve had the\\n biggest story of the year under\\n your byline. I should think you\\'d\\n be tickled pink.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not that,\" Jerry said\\n moodily. \"But ever since I heard\\n the Delegate speak, something\\'s\\n been nagging me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But don\\'t you think he\\'s done\\n good? Don\\'t you think they\\'ll be\\n impressed by what he said?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not worried about that.\\n I think that damn robot did\\n more for peace than anything\\n that\\'s ever come along in this\\n cockeyed world. But still ...\"\\n\\n\\n Greta snuggled up to him on\\n the sofa. \"You worry too much.\\n Don\\'t you ever think of anything\\n else? You should learn to\\n relax. It can be fun.\"\\n\\n\\n She started to prove it to him,\\n and Jerry responded the way a\\n normal, healthy male usually\\n does. But in the middle of an\\n embrace, he cried out:\\n\\n\\n \"Wait a minute!\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I just thought of something!\\n Now where the hell did I put\\n my old notebooks?\"\\n\\n\\n He got up from the sofa and\\n went scurrying to a closet. From\\n a debris of cardboard boxes, he\\n found a worn old leather brief\\n case, and cackled with delight\\n when he found the yellowed\\n notebooks inside.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\nare\\nthey?\" Greta said.\\n\\n\\n \"My old school notebooks.\\n Greta, you\\'ll have to excuse me.\\n But there\\'s something I\\'ve got\\n to do, right away!\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s all right with me,\"\\n Greta said haughtily. \"I know\\n when I\\'m not wanted.\"\\n\\n\\n She took her hat and coat from\\n the hall closet, gave him one\\n last chance to change his mind,\\n and then left.\\n\\n\\n Five minutes later, Jerry\\n Bridges was calling the airlines.\\nIt had been eleven years since\\n Jerry had walked across the\\n campus of Clifton University,\\n heading for the ivy-choked\\n main building. It was remarkable\\n how little had changed, but\\n the students seemed incredibly\\n young. He was winded by the\\n time he asked the pretty girl at\\n the desk where Professor Martin\\n Coltz could be located.\\n\\n\\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck\\n a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I\\n guess he\\'d be in the Holland\\n Laboratory about now.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Holland Laboratory? What\\'s\\n that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I guess that was after\\n your time, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed\\n to say: \"It must be something\\n new since I was here.\\n Where is this place?\"\\n\\n\\n He followed her directions,\\n and located a fresh-painted\\n building three hundred yards\\n from the men\\'s dorm. He met a\\n student at the door, who told\\n him that Professor Coltz would\\n be found in the physics department.\\n\\n\\n The room was empty when\\n Jerry entered, except for the\\n single stooped figure vigorously\\n erasing a blackboard. He turned\\n when the door opened. If the\\n students looked younger, Professor\\n Coltz was far older than\\n Jerry remembered. He was a\\n tall man, with an unruly confusion\\n of straight gray hair. He\\n blinked when Jerry said:\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember\\n me? Jerry Bridges?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course! I thought of you\\n only yesterday, when I saw your\\n name in the papers—\"\\n\\n\\n They sat at facing student\\n desks, and chatted about old\\n times. But Jerry was impatient\\n to get to the point of his visit,\\n and he blurted out:\\n\\n\\n \"Professor Coltz, something\\'s\\n been bothering me. It bothered\\n me from the moment I heard\\n the Delegate speak. I didn\\'t\\n know what it was until last\\n night, when I dug out my old\\n college notebooks. Thank God\\n I kept them.\"\\n\\n\\n Coltz\\'s eyes were suddenly\\n hooded.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There was something about\\n the Robot\\'s speech that sounded\\n familiar—I could have sworn\\n I\\'d heard some of the words\\n before. I couldn\\'t prove anything\\n until I checked my old\\n notes, and here\\'s what I found.\"\\n\\n\\n He dug into his coat pocket\\n and produced a sheet of paper.\\n He unfolded it and read aloud.\\n\\n\\n \"\\'It\\'s my belief that peace is\\n the responsibility of individuals,\\n of nations, and someday, even of\\n worlds ...\\' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\\n\\n\\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.\\n \"I don\\'t recall every silly thing\\n I said, Jerry.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s an interesting coincidence,\\n isn\\'t it, Professor?\\n These very words were spoken\\n by the Delegate from Venus.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A coincidence—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is it? But I also remember\\n your interest in robotics. I\\'ll\\n never forget that mechanical\\n homing pigeon you constructed.\\n And you\\'ve probably learned\\n much more these past eleven\\n years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are you driving at,\\n Jerry?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a\\n little daydream, recently, and I\\n want you to hear it. I dreamed\\n about a group of teachers, scientists,\\n and engineers, a group\\n who were suddenly struck by\\n an exciting, incredible idea. A\\n group that worked in the quiet\\n and secrecy of a University on a\\n fantastic scheme to force the\\n idea of peace into the minds of\\n the world\\'s big shots. Does my\\n dream interest you, Professor?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go on.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I dreamt that this\\n group would secretly launch an\\n earth satellite of their own, and\\n arrange for the nose cone to\\n come down safely at a certain\\n time and place. They would install\\n a marvelous electronic robot\\n within the cone, ready to be\\n assembled. They would beam a\\n radio message to earth from the\\n cone, seemingly as if it originated\\n from their \\'spaceship.\\'\\n Then, when the Robot was assembled,\\n they would speak\\n through it to demand peace for\\n all mankind ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"Jerry, if you do this—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t have to say it,\\n Professor, I know what you\\'re\\n thinking. I\\'m a reporter, and my\\n business is to tell the world\\n everything I know. But if I\\n did it, there might not be a\\n world for me to write about,\\n would there? No, thanks, Professor.\\n As far as I\\'m concerned,\\n what I told you was nothing\\n more than a daydream.\"\\nJerry braked the convertible\\n to a halt, and put his arm\\n around Greta\\'s shoulder. She\\n looked up at the star-filled night,\\n and sighed romantically.\\n\\n\\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\\n\\n\\n Greta shivered closer to him.\\n\\n\\n \"And to think what that terrible\\n planet can do to us!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also\\n the Goddess of Love.\"\\n\\n\\n He swung his other arm\\n around her, and Venus winked\\n approvingly.\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\\nOctober 1958.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

Oh,\\nI\\'m A Stranger\\n \\nHere Myself\\nBy MACK REYNOLDS\\nThe\\n Place de France is the\\n town\\'s hub. It marks the end\\n of Boulevard Pasteur, the main\\n drag of the westernized part of\\n the city, and the beginning of\\n Rue de la Liberté, which leads\\n down to the Grand Socco and\\n the medina. In a three-minute\\n walk from the Place de France\\n you can go from an ultra-modern,\\n California-like resort to the\\n Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s quite a town, Tangier.\\n\\n\\n King-size sidewalk cafes occupy\\n three of the strategic\\n corners on the Place de France.\\n The Cafe de Paris serves the\\n best draft beer in town, gets all\\n the better custom, and has three\\n shoeshine boys attached to the\\n establishment. You can sit of a\\n sunny morning and read the\\n Paris edition of the New York\\nHerald Tribune\\nwhile getting\\n your shoes done up like mirrors\\n for thirty Moroccan francs\\n which comes to about five cents\\n at current exchange.\\n\\n\\n You can sit there, after the\\n paper\\'s read, sip your expresso\\n and watch the people go by.\\n\\n\\n Tangier is possibly the most\\n cosmopolitan city in the world.\\n In native costume you\\'ll see\\n Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue\\n Man, and occasionally a Senegalese\\n from further south. In\\n European dress you\\'ll see Japs\\n and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,\\n Levantines and Filipinos, North\\n Americans and South Americans,\\n and, of course, even Europeans—from\\n both sides of the\\n Curtain.\\n\\n\\n In Tangier you\\'ll find some of\\n the world\\'s poorest and some of\\n the richest. The poorest will try\\n to sell you anything from a\\n shoeshine to their not very lily-white\\n bodies, and the richest will\\n avoid your eyes, afraid\\nyou\\nmight try to sell them something.\\n\\n\\n In spite of recent changes, the\\n town still has its unique qualities.\\n As a result of them the permanent\\n population includes\\n smugglers and black-marketeers,\\n fugitives from justice and international\\n con men, espionage\\n and counter-espionage agents,\\n homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,\\n drug addicts, displaced\\n persons, ex-royalty, and subversives\\n of every flavor. Local law\\n limits the activities of few of\\n these.\\n\\n\\n Like I said, it\\'s quite a town.\\nI looked up from my\\nHerald\\n Tribune\\nand said, \"Hello, Paul.\\n Anything new cooking?\"\\n\\n\\n He sank into the chair opposite\\n me and looked around for\\n the waiter. The tables were all\\n crowded and since mine was a\\n face he recognized, he assumed\\n he was welcome to intrude. It was\\n more or less standard procedure\\n at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn\\'t\\n a place to go if you wanted to\\n be alone.\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"How are you,\\n Rupert? Haven\\'t seen you for\\n donkey\\'s years.\"\\n\\n\\n The waiter came along and\\n Paul ordered a glass of beer.\\n Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced\\n little man. I vaguely remembered\\n somebody saying he\\n was from Liverpool and in\\n exports.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s in the newspaper?\"\\n he said, disinterestedly.\\n\\n\\n \"Pogo and Albert are going\\n to fight a duel,\" I told him, \"and\\n Lil Abner is becoming a rock\\'n\\'roll\\n singer.\"\\n\\n\\n He grunted.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said, \"the intellectual\\n type.\" I scanned the front page.\\n \"The Russkies have put up\\n another manned satellite.\"\\n\\n\\n \"They have, eh? How big?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Several times bigger than\\n anything we Americans have.\"\\n\\n\\n The beer came and looked\\n good, so I ordered a glass too.\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"What ever happened\\n to those poxy flying\\n saucers?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What flying saucers?\"\\n\\n\\n A French girl went by with a\\n poodle so finely clipped as to look\\n as though it\\'d been shaven. The\\n girl was in the latest from\\n Paris. Every pore in place. We\\n both looked after her.\\n\\n\\n \"You know, what everybody\\n was seeing a few years ago. It\\'s\\n too bad one of these bloody manned\\n satellites wasn\\'t up then.\\n Maybe they would\\'ve seen one.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s an idea,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n We didn\\'t say anything else for\\n a while and I began to wonder\\n if I could go back to my paper\\n without rubbing him the wrong\\n way. I didn\\'t know Paul very\\n well, but, for that matter, it\\'s\\n comparatively seldom you ever\\n get to know anybody very well\\n in Tangier. Largely, cards are\\n played close to the chest.\\nMy beer came and a plate of\\n tapas for us both. Tapas at the\\n Cafe de Paris are apt to be\\n potato salad, a few anchovies,\\n olives, and possibly some cheese.\\n Free lunch, they used to call it\\n in the States.\\n\\n\\n Just to say something, I said,\\n \"Where do you think they came\\n from?\" And when he looked\\n blank, I added, \"The Flying\\n Saucers.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned. \"From Mars or\\n Venus, or someplace.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ummmm,\" I said. \"Too bad\\n none of them ever crashed, or\\n landed on the Yale football field\\n and said\\nTake me to your cheerleader\\n,\\n or something.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul yawned and said, \"That\\n was always the trouble with those\\n crackpot blokes\\' explanations of\\n them. If they were aliens from\\n space, then why not show themselves?\"\\n\\n\\n I ate one of the potato chips.\\n It\\'d been cooked in rancid olive\\n oil.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Oh, there are various\\n answers to that one. We could\\n probably sit around here and\\n think of two or three that made\\n sense.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul was mildly interested.\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, hell, suppose for instance\\n there\\'s this big Galactic League\\n of civilized planets. But it\\'s restricted,\\n see. You\\'re not eligible\\n for membership until you, well,\\n say until you\\'ve developed space\\n flight. Then you\\'re invited into\\n the club. Meanwhile, they send\\n secret missions down from time\\n to time to keep an eye on your\\n progress.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul grinned at me. \"I see you\\n read the same poxy stuff I do.\"\\n\\n\\n A Moorish girl went by dressed\\n in a neatly tailored gray\\n jellaba, European style high-heeled\\n shoes, and a pinkish silk\\n veil so transparent that you\\n could see she wore lipstick. Very\\n provocative, dark eyes can be\\n over a veil. We both looked\\n after her.\\n\\n\\n I said, \"Or, here\\'s another\\n one. Suppose you have a very\\n advanced civilization on, say,\\n Mars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not Mars. No air, and too\\n bloody dry to support life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t interrupt, please,\" I\\n said with mock severity. \"This\\n is a very old civilization and as\\n the planet began to lose its\\n water and air, it withdrew underground.\\n Uses hydroponics and\\n so forth, husbands its water and\\n air. Isn\\'t that what we\\'d do, in\\n a few million years, if Earth lost\\n its water and air?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Anyway,\\n what about them?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, they observe how man\\n is going through a scientific\\n boom, an industrial boom, a\\n population boom. A boom, period.\\n Any day now he\\'s going to have\\n practical space ships. Meanwhile,\\n he\\'s also got the H-Bomb and\\n the way he beats the drums on\\n both sides of the Curtain, he\\'s\\n not against using it, if he could\\n get away with it.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul said, \"I got it. So they\\'re\\n scared and are keeping an eye on\\n us. That\\'s an old one. I\\'ve read\\n that a dozen times, dished up\\n different.\"\\n\\n\\n I shifted my shoulders. \"Well,\\n it\\'s one possibility.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I got a better one. How\\'s\\n this. There\\'s this alien life form\\n that\\'s way ahead of us. Their\\n civilization is so old that they\\n don\\'t have any records of when\\n it began and how it was in the\\n early days. They\\'ve gone beyond\\n things like wars and depressions\\n and revolutions, and greed for\\n power or any of these things\\n giving us a bad time here on\\n Earth. They\\'re all like scholars,\\n get it? And some of them are\\n pretty jolly well taken by Earth,\\n especially the way we are right\\n now, with all the problems, get\\n it? Things developing so fast we\\n don\\'t know where we\\'re going\\n or how we\\'re going to get there.\"\\nI finished my beer and clapped\\n my hands for Mouley. \"How do\\n you mean,\\nwhere we\\'re going\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, take half the countries\\n in the world today. They\\'re trying\\n to industrialize, modernize,\\n catch up with the advanced countries.\\n Look at Egypt, and Israel,\\n and India and China, and Yugoslavia\\n and Brazil, and all the\\n rest. Trying to drag themselves\\n up to the level of the advanced\\n countries, and all using different\\n methods of doing it. But look\\n at the so-called advanced countries.\\n Up to their bottoms in\\n problems. Juvenile delinquents,\\n climbing crime and suicide rates,\\n the loony-bins full of the balmy,\\n unemployed, threat of war,\\n spending all their money on armaments\\n instead of things like\\n schools. All the bloody mess of\\n it. Why, a man from Mars would\\n be fascinated, like.\"\\n\\n\\n Mouley came shuffling up in\\n his babouche slippers and we\\n both ordered another schooner\\n of beer.\\n\\n\\n Paul said seriously, \"You\\n know, there\\'s only one big snag\\n in this sort of talk. I\\'ve sorted\\n the whole thing out before, and\\n you always come up against this\\n brick wall. Where are they, these\\n observers, or scholars, or spies\\n or whatever they are? Sooner\\n or later we\\'d nab one of them.\\n You know, Scotland Yard, or\\n the F.B.I., or Russia\\'s secret\\n police, or the French Sûreté, or\\n Interpol. This world is so deep\\n in police, counter-espionage outfits\\n and security agents that an\\n alien would slip up in time, no\\n matter how much he\\'d been\\n trained. Sooner or later, he\\'d slip\\n up, and they\\'d nab him.\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Not necessarily.\\n The first time I ever considered\\n this possibility, it seemed\\n to me that such an alien would\\n base himself in London or New\\n York. Somewhere where he could\\n use the libraries for research,\\n get the daily newspapers and\\n the magazines. Be right in the\\n center of things. But now I don\\'t\\n think so. I think he\\'d be right\\n here in Tangier.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why Tangier?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s the one town in the world\\n where anything goes. Nobody\\n gives a damn about you or your\\n affairs. For instance, I\\'ve known\\n you a year or more now, and I\\n haven\\'t the slightest idea of how\\n you make your living.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Paul admitted.\\n \"In this town you seldom even\\n ask a man where\\'s he\\'s from. He\\n can be British, a White Russian,\\n a Basque or a Sikh and nobody\\n could care less. Where are\\nyou\\nfrom, Rupert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"California,\" I told him.\\n\\n\\n \"No, you\\'re not,\" he grinned.\\n\\n\\n I was taken aback. \"What do\\n you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I felt your mind probe back\\n a few minutes ago when I was\\n talking about Scotland Yard or\\n the F.B.I. possibly flushing an\\n alien. Telepathy is a sense not\\n trained by the humanoids. If\\n they had it, your job—and mine—would\\n be considerably more\\n difficult. Let\\'s face it, in spite of\\n these human bodies we\\'re disguised\\n in, neither of us is\\n humanoid. Where are you really\\n from, Rupert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Aldebaran,\" I said. \"How\\n about you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Deneb,\" he told me, shaking.\\n\\n\\n We had a laugh and ordered\\n another beer.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'re you doing here on\\n Earth?\" I asked him.\\n\\n\\n \"Researching for one of our\\n meat trusts. We\\'re protein\\n eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered\\n quite a delicacy. How\\n about you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Scouting the place for thrill\\n tourists. My job is to go around\\n to these backward cultures and\\n help stir up inter-tribal, or international,\\n conflicts—all according\\n to how advanced they\\n are. Then our tourists come in—well\\n shielded, of course—and get\\n their kicks watching it.\"\\n\\n\\n Paul frowned. \"That sort of\\n practice could spoil an awful\\n lot of good meat.\"\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Stories\\nDecember 1960.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

GALLUN\\nA scream of brakes, the splash\\n into icy waters, a long descent\\n into alkaline depths ... it was\\n death. But Ned Vince lived\\n again—a million years later!\\n\"See\\n you in half an hour,\\n Betty,\" said Ned Vince\\n over the party telephone. \"We\\'ll\\n be out at the Silver Basket before\\n ten-thirty....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was eager for the\\n company of the girl he loved.\\n That was why he was in a hurry\\n to get to the neighboring town\\n of Hurley, where she lived. His\\n old car rattled and roared as he\\n swung it recklessly around Pit\\n Bend.\\n\\n\\n There was where Death tapped\\n him on the shoulder. Another car\\n leaped suddenly into view, its\\n lights glaring blindingly past a\\n high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic\\n rock at the turn of the road.\\n\\n\\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his\\n own rash speed, Ned Vince had\\n only swift young reflexes to rely\\n on to avoid a fearful, telescoping\\n collision. He flicked his wheel\\n smoothly to the right; but the\\n County Highway Commission\\n hadn\\'t yet tarred the traffic-loosened\\n gravel at the Bend.\\nAn incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures.\\nNed could scarcely have chosen\\n a worse place to start sliding and\\n spinning. His car hit the white-painted\\n wooden rail sideways,\\n crashed through, tumbled down\\n a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,\\n bounced up a little, and\\n arced outward, falling as gracefully\\n as a swan-diver toward the\\n inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet\\n beneath....\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious\\n when that black, quiet\\n pool geysered around him in a\\n mighty splash. He had only a\\n dazing welt on his forehead, and\\n a gag of terror in his throat.\\n\\n\\n Movement was slower now, as\\n he began to sink, trapped inside\\n his wrecked car. Nothing that he\\n could imagine could mean doom\\n more certainly than this. The Pit\\n was a tremendously deep pocket\\n in the ground, spring-fed. The\\n edges of that almost bottomless\\n pool were caked with a rim of\\n white—for the water, on which\\n dead birds so often floated, was\\n surcharged with alkali. As that\\n heavy, natronous liquid rushed\\n up through the openings and\\n cracks beneath his feet, Ned\\n Vince knew that his friends and\\n his family would never see his\\n body again, lost beyond recovery\\n in this abyss.\\n\\n\\n The car was deeply submerged.\\n The light had blinked out on the\\n dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute\\n darkness. A flood rushed\\n in at the shattered window. He\\n clawed at the door, trying to\\n open it, but it was jammed in\\n the crash-bent frame, and he\\n couldn\\'t fight against the force\\n of that incoming water. The\\n welt, left by the blow he had received\\n on his forehead, put a\\n thickening mist over his brain,\\n so that he could not think clearly.\\n Presently, when he could no\\n longer hold his breath, bitter\\n liquid was sucked into his lungs.\\n\\n\\n His last thoughts were those\\n of a drowning man. The machine-shop\\n he and his dad had\\n had in Harwich. Betty Moore,\\n with the smiling Irish eyes—like\\n in the song. Betty and he\\n had planned to go to the State\\n University this Fall. They\\'d\\n planned to be married sometime....\\n Goodbye, Betty ...\\n\\n\\n The ripples that had ruffled\\n the surface waters in the Pit,\\n quieted again to glassy smoothness.\\n The eternal stars shone\\n calmly. The geologic Dakota\\n hills, which might have seen the\\n dinosaurs, still bulked along the\\n highway. Time, the Brother of\\n Death, and the Father of\\n Change, seemed to wait....\\n\"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\\n\\n\\n The excited cry, which no human\\n throat could quite have duplicated\\n accurately, arose thinly\\n from the depths of a powder-dry\\n gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable\\n antiquity. The noon-day\\n Sun was red and huge. The\\n air was tenuous, dehydrated,\\n chill.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!...\"\\n\\n\\n At first there was only one\\n voice uttering those weird, triumphant\\n sounds. Then other\\n vocal organs took up that trilling\\n wail, and those short, sharp\\n chuckles of eagerness. Other\\n questioning, wondering notes\\n mixed with the cadence. Lacking\\n qualities identifiable as human,\\n the disturbance was still like the\\n babble of a group of workmen\\n who have discovered something\\n remarkable.\\n\\n\\n The desolate expanse around\\n the gulch, was all but without\\n motion. The icy breeze tore tiny\\n puffs of dust from grotesque,\\n angling drifts of soil, nearly\\n waterless for eons. Patches of\\n drab lichen grew here and there\\n on the up-jutting rocks, but in\\n the desert itself, no other life\\n was visible. Even the hills had\\n sagged away, flattened by incalculable\\n ages of erosion.\\nAt a mile distance, a crumbling\\n heap of rubble arose. Once\\n it had been a building. A gigantic,\\n jagged mass of detritus\\n slanted upward from its crest—red\\n debris that had once been\\n steel. A launching catapult for\\n the last space ships built by the\\n gods in exodus, perhaps it was—half\\n a million years ago. Man\\n was gone from the Earth. Glacial\\n ages, war, decadence, disease,\\n and a final scattering of those\\n ultimate superhumans to newer\\n worlds in other solar systems,\\n had done that.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n The sounds were not human.\\n They were more like the chatter\\n and wail of small desert animals.\\n\\n\\n But there was a seeming paradox\\n here in the depths of that\\n gulch, too. The glint of metal,\\n sharp and burnished. The flat,\\n streamlined bulk of a flying machine,\\n shiny and new. The bell-like\\n muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,\\n which seemed to\\n depend on a blast of atoms to\\n clear away rock and soil. Thus\\n the gulch had been cleared of the\\n accumulated rubbish of antiquity.\\n Man, it seemed, had a successor,\\n as ruler of the Earth.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological\\n expedition out from the\\n far lowlands to the east, out\\n from the city of Kar-Rah. And\\n he was very happy now—flushed\\n with a vast and unlooked-for\\n success.\\n\\n\\n He crouched there on his\\n haunches, at the dry bottom of\\n the Pit. The breeze rumpled his\\n long, brown fur. He wasn\\'t very\\n different in appearance from his\\n ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,\\n as he squatted there in that antique\\n stance of his kind. His tail\\n was short and furred, his undersides\\n creamy. White whiskers\\n spread around his inquisitive,\\n pink-tipped snout.\\n\\n\\n But his cranium bulged up and\\n forward between shrewd, beady\\n eyes, betraying the slow heritage\\n of time, of survival of the fittest,\\n of evolution. He could think and\\n dream and invent, and the civilization\\n of his kind was already\\n far beyond that of the ancient\\n Twentieth Century.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers\\n were gathered, tense and\\n gleeful, around the things their\\n digging had exposed to the daylight.\\n There was a gob of junk—scarcely\\n more than an irregular\\n formation of flaky rust. But imbedded\\n in it was a huddled form,\\n brown and hard as old wood. The\\n dry mud that had encased it\\n like an airtight coffin, had by\\n now been chipped away by the\\n tiny investigators; but soiled\\n clothing still clung to it, after\\n perhaps a million years. Metal\\n had gone into decay—yes. But\\n not this body. The answer to this\\n was simple—alkali. A mineral\\n saturation that had held time\\n and change in stasis. A perfect\\n preservative for organic tissue,\\n aided probably during most of\\n those passing eras by desert dryness.\\n The Dakotas had turned\\n arid very swiftly. This body was\\n not a mere fossil. It was a\\n mummy.\\n\"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.\\n Not the star-conquering demi-gods,\\n but the ancestral stock\\n that had built the first\\n machines on Earth, and in the\\n early Twenty-first Century, the\\n first interplanetary rockets. No\\n wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers\\n were happy in their\\n paleontological enthusiasm! A\\n strange accident, happening in a\\n legendary antiquity, had aided\\n them in their quest for knowledge.\\n\\n\\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,\\n chirping signal. The chant of\\n triumph ended, while instruments\\n flicked in his tiny hands.\\n The final instrument he used to\\n test the mummy, looked like a\\n miniature stereoscope, with complicated\\n details. He held it over\\n his eyes. On the tiny screen\\n within, through the agency of\\n focused X-rays, he saw magnified\\n images of the internal organs\\n of this ancient human\\n corpse.\\n\\n\\n What his probing gaze revealed\\n to him, made his pleasure\\n even greater than before. In\\n twittering, chattering sounds, he\\n communicated his further knowledge\\n to his henchmen. Though\\n devoid of moisture, the mummy\\n was perfectly preserved, even to\\n its brain cells! Medical and biological\\n sciences were far advanced\\n among Loy Chuk\\'s kind.\\n Perhaps, by the application of\\n principles long known to them,\\n this long-dead body could be\\n made to live again! It might\\n move, speak, remember its past!\\n What a marvelous subject for\\n study it would make, back there\\n in the museums of Kar-Rah!\\n\\n\\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n\\n\\n But Loy silenced this fresh,\\n eager chattering with a command.\\n Work was always more\\n substantial than cheering.\\nWith infinite care—small,\\n sharp hand-tools were used, now—the\\n mummy of Ned Vince was\\n disengaged from the worthless\\n rust of his primitive automobile.\\n With infinite care it was crated\\n in a metal case, and hauled into\\n the flying machine.\\n\\n\\n Flashing flame, the latter\\n arose, bearing the entire hundred\\n members of the expedition.\\n The craft shot eastward at bullet-like\\n speed. The spreading\\n continental plateau of North\\n America seemed to crawl backward,\\n beneath. A tremendous\\n sand desert, marked with low,\\n washed-down mountains, and the\\n vague, angular, geometric\\n mounds of human cities that\\n were gone forever.\\n\\n\\n Beyond the eastern rim of the\\n continent, the plain dipped downward\\n steeply. The white of dried\\n salt was on the hills, but there\\n was a little green growth here,\\n too. The dead sea-bottom of the\\n vanished Atlantic was not as\\n dead as the highlands.\\n\\n\\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,\\n the city of the rodents,\\n came into view—a crystalline\\n maze of low, bubble-like structures,\\n glinting in the red sunshine.\\n But this was only its surface\\n aspect. Loy Chuk\\'s people\\n had built their homes mostly underground,\\n since the beginning\\n of their foggy evolution. Besides,\\n in this latter day, the\\n nights were very cold, the shelter\\n of subterranean passages and\\n rooms was welcome.\\n\\n\\n The mummy was taken to Loy\\n Chuk\\'s laboratory, a short distance\\n below the surface. Here at\\n once, the scientist began his\\n work. The body of the ancient\\n man was put in a large vat.\\n Fluids submerged it, slowly\\n soaking from that hardened flesh\\n the alkali that had preserved it\\n for so long. The fluid was\\n changed often, until woody muscles\\n and other tissues became\\n pliable once more.\\n\\n\\n Then the more delicate processes\\n began. Still submerged in\\n liquid, the corpse was submitted\\n to a flow of restorative energy,\\n passing between complicated\\n electrodes. The cells of antique\\n flesh and brain gradually took on\\n a chemical composition nearer to\\n that of the life that they had\\n once known.\\nAt last the final liquid was\\n drained away, and the mummy\\n lay there, a mummy no more, but\\n a pale, silent figure in its tatters\\n of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,\\n metal-fabric helmet on its head,\\n and a second, much smaller helmet\\n on his own. Connected with\\n this arrangement, was a black\\n box of many uses. For hours he\\n worked with his apparatus,\\n studying, and guiding the recording\\n instruments. The time\\n passed swiftly.\\n\\n\\n At last, eager and ready for\\n whatever might happen now,\\n Loy Chuk pushed another switch.\\n With a cold, rosy flare, energy\\n blazed around that moveless\\n form.\\n\\n\\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity\\n ended like a gradual fading\\n mist. When he could see clearly\\n again, he experienced that inevitable\\n shock of vast change\\n around him. Though it had been\\n dehydrated, his brain had been\\n kept perfectly intact through the\\n ages, and now it was restored.\\n So his memories were as vivid as\\n yesterday.\\n\\n\\n Yet, through that crystalline\\n vat in which he lay, he could see\\n a broad, low room, in which he\\n could barely have stood erect. He\\n saw instruments and equipment\\n whose weird shapes suggested\\n alienness, and knowledge beyond\\n the era he had known! The walls\\n were lavender and phosphorescent.\\n Fossil bone-fragments were\\n mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur\\n bones, some of them\\n seemed, from their size. But\\n there was a complete skeleton of\\n a dog, too, and the skeleton of a\\n man, and a second man-skeleton\\n that was not quite human. Its\\n neck-vertebrae were very thick\\n and solid, its shoulders were\\n wide, and its skull was gigantic.\\n\\n\\n All this weirdness had a violent\\n effect on Ned Vince—a sudden,\\n nostalgic panic. Something\\n was fearfully wrong!\\n\\n\\n The nervous terror of the unknown\\n was on him. Feeble and\\n dizzy after his weird resurrection,\\n which he could not understand,\\n remembering as he did\\n that moment of sinking to certain\\n death in the pool at Pit\\n Bend, he caught the edge of the\\n transparent vat, and pulled himself\\n to a sitting posture. There\\n was a muffled murmur around\\n him, as of some vast, un-Earthly\\n metropolis.\\n\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\\n\\n\\n The words themselves, and the\\n way they were assembled, were\\n old, familiar friends. But the\\n tone was wrong. It was high,\\n shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.\\n Ned\\'s gaze searched for the\\n source of the voice—located the\\n black box just outside of his\\n crystal vat. From that box the\\n voice seemed to have originated.\\n Before it crouched a small,\\n brownish animal with a bulging\\n head. The animal\\'s tiny-fingered\\n paws—hands they were, really—were\\n touching rows of keys.\\n\\n\\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly\\n insane and incomprehensible.\\n A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,\\n a little; but plainly possessing\\n a high order of intelligence.\\n And a voice whose soothingly\\n familiar words were more repugnant\\n somehow, simply because\\n they could never belong in a\\n place as eerie as this.\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince did not know how\\n Loy Chuk had probed his brain,\\n with the aid of a pair of helmets,\\n and the black box apparatus. He\\n did not know that in the latter,\\n his language, taken from his\\n own revitalized mind, was recorded,\\n and that Loy Chuk had\\n only to press certain buttons to\\n make the instrument express his\\n thoughts in common, long-dead\\n English. Loy, whose vocal organs\\n were not human, would have had\\n great difficulty speaking English\\n words, anyway.\\n\\n\\n Ned\\'s dark hair was wildly\\n awry. His gaunt, young face\\n held befuddled terror. He gasped\\n in the thin atmosphere. \"I\\'ve\\n gone nuts,\" he pronounced with\\n a curious calm. \"Stark—starin\\'—nuts....\"\\nLoy\\'s box, with its recorded\\n English words and its sonic detectors,\\n could translate for its\\n master, too. As the man spoke,\\n Loy read the illuminated symbols\\n in his own language, flashed\\n on a frosted crystal plate before\\n him. Thus he knew what Ned\\n Vince was saying.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,\\n and the box reproduced his answer:\\n \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a\\n bit of it! There are just a lot of\\n things that you\\'ve got to get\\n used to, that\\'s all. You drowned\\n about a million years ago. I discovered\\n your body. I brought you\\n back to life. We have science\\n that can do that. I\\'m Loy\\n Chuk....\"\\nIt took only a moment for the\\n box to tell the full story in clear,\\n bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy\\n sought, with calm, human logic,\\n to make his charge feel at home.\\n Probably, though, he was a fool,\\n to suppose that he could succeed,\\n thus.\\n\\n\\n Vince started to mutter,\\n struggling desperately to reason\\n it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.\\n \"Speaking to me. One million\\n years. Evolution. The scientists\\n say that people grew up from\\n fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs\\n are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs\\n could come from\\n them. A lot easier than men\\n from fish....\"\\n\\n\\n It was all sound logic. Even\\n Ned Vince knew that. Still, his\\n mind, tuned to ordinary, simple\\n things, couldn\\'t quite realize all\\n the vast things that had happened\\n to himself, and to the\\n world. The scope of it all was too\\n staggeringly big. One million\\n years. God!...\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince made a last effort\\n to control himself. His knuckles\\n tightened on the edge of the vat.\\n \"I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been\\n talking about,\" he grated wildly.\\n \"But I want to get out of here!\\n I want to go back where I came\\n from! Do you understand—whoever,\\n or whatever you are?\"\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.\\n \"But you can\\'t go back to the\\n Twentieth Century,\" said the\\n box. \"Nor is there any better\\n place for you to be now, than\\n Kar-Rah. You are the only man\\n left on Earth. Those men that\\n exist in other star systems are\\n not really your kind anymore,\\n though their forefathers originated\\n on this planet. They have\\n gone far beyond you in evolution.\\n To them you would be only a\\n senseless curiosity. You are\\n much better off with my people—our\\n minds are much more like\\n yours. We will take care of you,\\n and make you comfortable....\"\\n\\n\\n But Ned Vince wasn\\'t listening,\\n now. \"You are the only\\n man left on Earth.\" That had\\n been enough for him to hear. He\\n didn\\'t more than half believe it.\\n His mind was too confused for\\n conviction about anything. Everything\\n he saw and felt and\\n heard might be some kind of\\n nightmare. But then it might all\\n be real instead, and that was\\n abysmal horror. Ned was no\\n coward—death and danger of\\n any ordinary Earthly kind, he\\n could have faced bravely. But the\\n loneliness here, and the utter\\n strangeness, were hideous like\\n being stranded alone on another\\n world!\\n\\n\\n His heart was pounding heavily,\\n and his eyes were wide. He\\n looked across this eerie room.\\n There was a ramp there at the\\n other side, leading upward instead\\n of a stairway. Fierce impulse\\n to escape this nameless\\n lair, to try to learn the facts for\\n himself, possessed him. He\\n bounded out of the vat, and\\n with head down, dashed for the\\n ramp.\\nHe had to go most of the way\\n on his hands and knees, for the\\n up-slanting passage was low. Excited\\n animal chucklings around\\n him, and the occasional touch of\\n a furry body, hurried his feverish\\n scrambling. But he emerged\\n at last at the surface.\\n\\n\\n He stood there panting in that\\n frigid, rarefied air. It was night.\\n The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked\\n bulk. The constellations\\n were unrecognizable. The rodent\\n city was a glowing expanse of\\n shallow, crystalline domes, set\\n among odd, scrub trees and\\n bushes. The crags loomed on all\\n sides, all their jaggedness lost\\n after a million years of erosion\\n under an ocean that was gone.\\n In that ghastly moonlight, the\\n ground glistened with dry salt.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess it\\'s all true,\\n huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a\\n flat tone.\\n\\n\\n Behind him he heard an excited,\\n squeaky chattering. Rodents\\n in pursuit. Looking back,\\n he saw the pinpoint gleams of\\n countless little eyes. Yes, he\\n might as well be an exile on another\\n planet—so changed had the\\n Earth become.\\n\\n\\n A wave of intolerable homesickness\\n came over him as he\\n sensed the distances of time that\\n had passed—those inconceivable\\n eons, separating himself from\\n his friends, from Betty, from almost\\n everything that was familiar.\\n He started to run, away\\n from those glittering rodent\\n eyes. He sensed death in that\\n cold sea-bottom, but what of it?\\n What reason did he have left to\\n live? He\\'d be only a museum\\n piece here, a thing to be caged\\n and studied....\\n\\n\\n Prison or a madhouse would\\n be far better. He tried to get\\n hold of his courage. But what\\n was there to inspire it? Nothing!\\n He laughed harshly as he\\n ran, welcoming that bitter, killing\\n cold. Nostalgia had him in\\n its clutch, and there was no answer\\n in his hell-world, lost beyond\\n the barrier of the years....\\nLoy Chuk and his followers\\n presently came upon Ned Vince\\'s\\n unconscious form, a mile from\\n the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying\\n machine they took him back, and\\n applied stimulants. He came to,\\n in the same laboratory room as\\n before. But he was firmly\\n strapped to a low platform this\\n time, so that he could not escape\\n again. There he lay, helpless,\\n until presently an idea occurred\\n to him. It gave him a few crumbs\\n of hope.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better get some rest,\\n Ned Vince,\" came the answer\\n from the black box. It was Loy\\n Chuk speaking again.\\n\\n\\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.\\n \"You know a lot more than we\\n did in the Twentieth Century.\\n And—well—there\\'s that thing\\n called time-travel, that I used to\\n read about. Maybe you know how\\n to make it work! Maybe you\\n could send me back to my own\\n time after all!\"\\n\\n\\n Little Loy Chuk was in a\\n black, discouraged mood, himself.\\n He could understand the\\n utter, sick dejection of this\\n giant from the past, lost from\\n his own kind. Probably insanity\\n looming. In far less extreme circumstances\\n than this, death from\\n homesickness had come.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In\\n common with all real scientists,\\n regardless of the species from\\n which they spring, he loved the\\n subjects of his researches. He\\n wanted this ancient man to live\\n and to be happy. Or this creature\\n would be of scant value for\\n study.\\n\\n\\n So Loy considered carefully\\n what Ned Vince had suggested.\\n Time-travel. Almost a legend. An\\n assault upon an intangible wall\\n that had baffled far keener wits\\n than Loy\\'s. But he was bent,\\n now, on the well-being of this\\n anachronism he had so miraculously\\n resurrected—this human,\\n this Kaalleee....\\n\\n\\n Loy jabbed buttons on the\\n black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"\\n said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.\\n Perhaps that is the only\\n thing to do—to send you back\\n to your own period of history.\\n For I see that you will never be\\n yourself, here. It will be hard to\\n accomplish, but we\\'ll try. Now\\n I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned felt better immediately,\\n for there was real hope now,\\n where there had been none before.\\n Maybe he\\'d be back in his\\n home-town of Harwich again.\\n Maybe he\\'d see the old machine-shop,\\n there. And the trees greening\\n out in Spring. Maybe he\\'d\\n be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,\\n soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny\\n hypo-needle bit into his arm....\\n\\n\\n As soon as Ned Vince passed\\n into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk\\n went to work once more, using\\n that pair of brain-helmets again,\\n exploring carefully the man\\'s\\n mind. After hours of research,\\n he proceeded to prepare his\\n plans. The government of Kar-Rah\\n was a scientific oligarchy,\\n of which Loy was a prime member.\\n It would be easy to get the\\n help he needed.\\n\\n\\n A horde of small, grey-furred\\n beings and their machines, toiled\\n for many days.\\nNed Vince\\'s mind swam\\n gradually out of the blur that\\n had enveloped it. He was wandering\\n aimlessly about in a familiar\\n room. The girders of the\\n roof above were of red-painted\\n steel. His tool-benches were\\n there, greasy and littered with\\n metal filings, just as they had\\n always been. He had a tractor to\\n repair, and a seed-drill. Outside\\n of the machine-shop, the old,\\n familiar yellow sun was shining.\\n Across the street was the small\\n brown house, where he lived.\\n\\n\\n With a sudden startlement, he\\n saw Betty Moore in the doorway.\\n She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous\\n smile curved her lips.\\n As though she had succeeded in\\n creeping up on him, for a surprise.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.\\n \"You look as though you\\'ve been\\n dreaming, and just woke up!\"\\n\\n\\n He grimaced ruefully as she\\n approached. With a kind of fierce\\n gratitude, he took her in his\\n arms. Yes, she was just like\\n always.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I\\nwas\\ndreaming,\\n Betty,\" he whispered, feeling\\n that mighty sense of relief. \"I\\n must have fallen asleep at the\\n bench, here, and had a nightmare.\\n I thought I had an accident\\n at Pit Bend—and that a\\n lot of worse things happened....\\n But it wasn\\'t true ...\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince\\'s mind, over which\\n there was still an elusive fog that\\n he did not try to shake off, accepted\\n apparent facts simply.\\n\\n\\n He did not know anything\\n about the invisible radiations\\n beating down upon him, soothing\\n and dimming his brain, so that\\n it would never question or doubt,\\n or observe too closely the incongruous\\n circumstances that must\\n often appear. The lack of traffic\\n in the street without, for instance—and\\n the lack of people\\n besides himself and Betty.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t know that this machine-shop\\n was built from his\\n own memories of the original.\\n He didn\\'t know that this Betty\\n was of the same origin—a miraculous\\n fabrication of metal\\n and energy-units and soft plastic.\\n The trees outside were only\\n lantern-slide illusions.\\n\\n\\n It was all built inside a great,\\n opaque dome. But there were\\n hidden television systems, too.\\n Thus Loy Chuk\\'s kind could\\n study this ancient man—this\\n Kaalleee. Thus, their motives\\n were mostly selfish.\\n\\n\\n Loy, though, was not observing,\\n now. He had wandered far\\n out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to\\n ponder. He squeaked and chatted\\n to himself, contemplating the\\n magnificent, inexorable march of\\n the ages. He remembered the ancient\\n ruins, left by the final supermen.\\n\\n\\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself\\n home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He\\n will survive and be happy. But\\n there was no other way. Time is\\n an Eternal Wall. Our archeological\\n researches among the cities\\n of the supermen show the truth.\\n Even they, who once ruled Earth,\\n never escaped from the present\\n by so much as an instant....\"\\nTHE END\\nPRINTED IN U.

They\\n need adult guidance of course, and\\n one of the group suggested my name.\"\\n\\n\\n I should explain, perhaps, that I\\n teach a course in general science in\\n our Ridgeville Junior High School,\\n and another in general physics in the\\n Senior High School. It\\'s a privilege\\n which I\\'m sure many educators must\\n envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our\\n new school is a fine one, and our\\n academic standards are high. On the\\n other hand, the fathers of most of\\n my students work for the Commission\\n and a constant awareness of the Commission\\n and its work pervades the\\n town. It is an uneasy privilege then,\\n at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned\\n brand of science to these\\n children of a new age.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s very nice,\" said Marjorie.\\n \"What does a junior achievement\\n group do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,\\n \"of teaching the members something\\n about commerce and industry. They\\n manufacture simple compositions\\n like polishing waxes and sell them\\n from door-to-door. Some groups have\\n built up tidy little bank accounts\\n which are available for later educational\\n expenses.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gracious, you wouldn\\'t have to\\n sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not. I\\'d just tell the\\n kids how to do it.\"\\n\\n\\n Marjorie put back her head and\\n laughed, and I was forced to join her,\\n for we both recognize that my understanding\\n and \"feel\" for commercial\\n matters—if I may use that expression—is\\n almost nonexistent.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at\\n my commercial aspirations. But don\\'t\\n worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack\\n said we could get Mr. Wells from\\n Commercial Department to help out\\n if he was needed. There is one problem,\\n though. Mr. McCormack is going\\n to put up fifty dollars to buy any\\n raw materials wanted and he rather\\n suggested that I might advance another\\n fifty. The question is, could we\\n do it?\"\\n\\n\\n Marjorie did mental arithmetic.\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it\\'s something\\n you\\'d like to do.\"\\n\\n\\n We\\'ve had to watch such things\\n rather closely for the last ten—no,\\n eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,\\n fifty-odd miles to the south, we\\n had our home almost paid for, when\\n the accident occurred. It was in the\\n path of the heaviest fallout, and we\\n couldn\\'t have kept on living there\\n even if the town had stayed. When\\n Ridgeville moved to its present site,\\n so, of course, did we, which meant\\n starting mortgage payments all over\\n again.\\nThus it was that on a Wednesday\\n morning about three weeks later, I\\n was sitting at one end of a plank picnic\\n table with five boys and girls\\n lined up along the sides. This was to\\n be our headquarters and factory for\\n the summer—a roomy unused barn\\n belonging to the parents of one of\\n the group members, Tommy Miller.\\n\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let\\'s relax. You\\n don\\'t need to treat me as a teacher,\\n you know. I stopped being a school\\n teacher when the final grades went in\\n last Friday. I\\'m on vacation now. My\\n job here is only to advise, and I\\'m\\n going to do that as little as possible.\\n You\\'re going to decide what to do,\\n and if it\\'s safe and legal and possible\\n to do with the starting capital we\\n have, I\\'ll go along with it and help\\n in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\\n\\n\\n Mr. McCormack had told me, and\\n in some detail, about the youngsters\\n I\\'d be dealing with. The three who\\n were sitting to my left were the ones\\n who had proposed the group in the\\n first place.\\n\\n\\n Doris Enright was a grave young\\n lady of ten years, who might, I\\n thought, be quite a beauty in a few\\n more years, but was at the moment\\n rather angular—all shoulders and elbows.\\n Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack\\n were skinny kids, too. The three\\n were of an age and were all tall for\\n ten-year-olds.\\n\\n\\n I had the impression during that\\n first meeting that they looked rather\\n alike, but this wasn\\'t so. Their features\\n were quite different. Perhaps\\n from association, for they were close\\n friends, they had just come to have\\n a certain similarity of restrained gesture\\n and of modulated voice. And\\n they were all tanned by sun and wind\\n to a degree that made their eyes seem\\n light and their teeth startlingly white.\\n\\n\\n The two on my right were cast in\\n a different mold. Mary McCready\\n was a big husky redhead of twelve,\\n with a face full of freckles and an\\n infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,\\n a few months younger, was just an\\n average, extroverted, well adjusted\\n youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted\\n and butch-barbered.\\n\\n\\n The group exchanged looks to see\\n who would lead off, and Peter Cope\\n seemed to be elected.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior\\n achievement group is a bunch of kids\\n who get together to manufacture and\\n sell things, and maybe make some\\n money.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is that what you want to do,\" I\\n asked, \"make money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.\\n \"There\\'s something wrong with making\\n money?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"\\n said Hilary. \"We\\'ll need some money\\n to do the things we want to do later.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And what sort of things would\\n you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n The usual products, of course, with\\n these junior achievement efforts, are\\n chemical specialties that can be made\\n safely and that people will buy and\\n use without misgivings—solvent to\\n free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove\\n road tar, mechanic\\'s hand soap—that\\n sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had\\n told me, though, that I might find\\n these youngsters a bit more ambitious.\\n \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"\\n he had said, \"have exceptionally\\n high IQ\\'s—around one forty\\n or one fifty. The other three are hard\\n to classify. They have some of the\\n attributes of exceptional pupils, but\\n much of the time they seem to have\\n little interest in their studies. The\\n junior achievement idea has sparked\\n their imaginations. Maybe it\\'ll be just\\n what they need.\"\\n\\n\\n Mary said, \"Why don\\'t we make a\\n freckle remover? I\\'d be our first customer.\"\\n\"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,\\n \"is to figure out what people in\\n Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it\\n to them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d like to make something by\\n powder metallurgy techniques,\" said\\n Pete. He fixed me with a challenging\\n eye. \"You should be able to make\\n ball bearings by molding, then densify\\n them by electroplating.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And all we\\'d need is a hydraulic\\n press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,\\n might cost ten thousand dollars. Let\\'s\\n think of something easier.\"\\n\\n\\n Pete mulled it over and nodded\\n reluctantly. \"Then maybe something\\n in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly\\n of some kind.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary\\n put in.\\n\\n\\n \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"\\n I asked.\\n\\n\\n He was scornful. \"No, they\\'re formulations—you\\n know, mixtures.\\n That\\'s cookbook chemistry. I mean a\\n brand new synthetic detergent. I\\'ve\\n got an idea for one that ought to be\\n good even in the hard water we\\'ve\\n got around here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis\\n sounds like another operation\\n calling for capital investment. If we\\n should keep the achievement group\\n going for several summers, it might\\n be possible later on to carry out a\\n safe synthesis of some sort. You\\'re\\n Dr. Matlack\\'s son, aren\\'t you? Been\\n dipping into your father\\'s library?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I\\'ve got\\n a home laboratory.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about you, Doris?\" I prompted.\\n \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No.\" She shook her head in mock\\n despondency. \"I\\'m not very technical.\\n Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the\\n group wanted to raise some mice, I\\'d\\n be willing to turn over a project I\\'ve\\n had going at home.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded\\n incredulously.\\n\\n\\n \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and\\n thought about it. \"Are they a pure\\n strain? One of the recognized laboratory\\n strains? Healthy mice of the\\n right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,\\n \"might be sold to laboratories. I have\\n an idea the Commission buys a supply\\n every month.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren\\'t laboratory\\n mice. They\\'re fancy ones. I\\n got the first four pairs from a pet\\n shop in Denver, but they\\'re red—sort\\n of chipmunk color, you know. I\\'ve\\n carried them through seventeen generations\\n of careful selection.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market\\n for red mice might be rather limited.\\n Why don\\'t you consider making\\n an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,\\n glycerine, water, a little color\\n and perfume. You could buy some\\n bottles and have some labels printed.\\n You\\'d be in business before you\\n knew it.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a pause, then Tommy\\n inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Door-to-door.\"\\n\\n\\n He made a face. \"Never build up\\n any volume. Unless it did something\\n extra. You say we\\'d put color in it.\\n How about enough color to leave\\n your face looking tanned. Men won\\'t\\n use cosmetics and junk, but if they\\n didn\\'t have to admit it, they might\\n like the shave lotion.\"\\n\\n\\n Hilary had been deep in thought.\\n He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I\\n know how to make a—what do you\\n want to call it—a before-shave lotion.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would that be?\" I asked.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d use it before you shaved.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose there might be people\\n who\\'d prefer to use it beforehand,\"\\n I conceded.\\n\\n\\n \"There will be people,\" he said\\n darkly, and subsided.\\n\\n\\n Mrs. Miller came out to the barn\\n after a while, bringing a bucket of\\n soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves\\n of bread and ingredients for a variety\\n of sandwiches. The parents had\\n agreed to underwrite lunches at the\\n barn and Betty Miller philosophically\\n assumed the role of commissary\\n officer. She paused only to say hello\\n and to ask how we were progressing\\n with our organization meeting.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d forgotten all about organization,\\n and that, according to all the\\n articles I had perused, is most important\\n to such groups. It\\'s standard practice\\n for every member of the group\\n to be a company officer. Of course a\\n young boy who doesn\\'t know any better,\\n may wind up a sales manager.\\n\\n\\n Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested\\n nominating company officers,\\n but they seemed not to be interested.\\n Peter Cope waved it off by remarking\\n that they\\'d each do what came\\n naturally. On the other hand, they\\n pondered at some length about a\\n name for the organization, without\\n reaching any conclusions, so we returned\\n to the problem of what to\\n make.\\n\\n\\n It was Mary, finally, who advanced\\n the thought of kites. At first there\\n was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,\\n \"You know, we could work up something\\n new. Has anybody ever seen a\\n kite made like a wind sock?\"\\n\\n\\n Nobody had. Pete drew figures in\\n the air with his hands. \"How about\\n the hole at the small end?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll make one tonight,\" said Doris,\\n \"and think about the small end.\\n It\\'ll work out all right.\"\\n\\n\\n I wished that the youngsters weren\\'t\\n starting out by inventing a new\\n article to manufacture, and risking an\\n almost certain disappointment, but to\\n hold my guidance to the minimum, I\\n said nothing, knowing that later I\\n could help them redesign it along\\n standard lines.\\nAt supper I reviewed the day\\'s\\n happenings with Marjorie and tried\\n to recall all of the ideas which had\\n been propounded. Most of them were\\n impractical, of course, for a group of\\n children to attempt, but several of\\n them appeared quite attractive.\\n\\n\\n Tommy, for example, wanted to\\n put tooth powder into tablets that\\n one would chew before brushing the\\n teeth. He thought there should be\\n two colors in the same bottle—orange\\n for morning and blue for night,\\n the blue ones designed to leave the\\n mouth alkaline at bed time.\\n\\n\\n Pete wanted to make a combination\\n nail and wood screw. You\\'d\\n drive it in with a hammer up to the\\n threaded part, then send it home with\\n a few turns of a screwdriver.\\n\\n\\n Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his\\n ideas on detergents, suggested we\\n make black plastic discs, like poker\\n chips but thinner and as cheap as\\n possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk\\n where they would pick up extra\\n heat from the sun and melt the\\n snow more rapidly. Afterward one\\n would sweep up and collect the discs.\\n\\n\\n Doris added to this that if you\\n could make the discs light enough to\\n float, they might be colored white\\n and spread on the surface of a reservoir\\n to reduce evaporation.\\n\\n\\n These latter ideas had made unknowing\\n use of some basic physics,\\n and I\\'m afraid I relapsed for a few\\n minutes into the role of teacher and\\n told them a little bit about the laws\\n of radiation and absorption of heat.\\n\\n\\n \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they\\'re really\\n smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller\\n does sound like a born salesman.\\n Somehow I don\\'t think you\\'re going\\n to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\\n\\n\\n I do feel just a little embarrassed\\n about the kite, even now. The fact\\n that it flew surprised me. That it flew\\n so confoundedly well was humiliating.\\n Four of them were at the barn\\n when I arrived next morning; or\\n rather on the rise of ground just beyond\\n it, and the kite hung motionless\\n and almost out of sight in the pale\\n sky. I stood and watched for a moment,\\n then they saw me.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,\\n and proffered the cord which was\\n wound on a fishing reel. I played the\\n kite up and down for a few minutes,\\n then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,\\n a wind sock, but the hole at the\\n small end was shaped—by wire—into\\n the general form of a kidney bean.\\n It was beautifully made, and had a\\n sort of professional look about it.\\n\\n\\n \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.\\n \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree\\n sometimes.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let\\'s\\n see it.\" She gave the wire at the small\\n end the slightest of twists. \"There, it\\n ought to swoop.\"\\n\\n\\n Sure enough, in the moderate\\n breeze of that morning, the kite\\n swooped and yawed to Mary\\'s entire\\n satisfaction. As we trailed back to the\\n barn I asked Doris, \"How did you\\n know that flattening the lower edge\\n of the hole would create instability?\"\\n She looked doubtful.\\n\\n\\n \"Why it would have to, wouldn\\'t\\n it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"\\n She glanced at me quickly.\\n \"Of course, I tried a lot of different\\n shapes while I was making it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at\\n that. \"Where\\'s Tommy?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete\\n Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.\\n We\\'ll want to buy materials to\\n make some of these kites.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack\\n and I were going to advance\\n some cash to get started.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, but don\\'t you think it\\n would be better to borrow from a\\n bank? More businesslike?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally\\n want some security.\" I would\\n have gone on and explained matters\\n further, except that Tommy walked\\n in and handed me a pocket check\\n book.\\n\\n\\n \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he\\n volunteered—not without a hint of\\n complacency in his voice. \"It didn\\'t\\n take long, but they sure made it out\\n a big deal. Half the guys in the bank\\n had to be called in to listen to the\\n proposition. The account\\'s in your\\n name, Mr. Henderson, and you\\'ll have\\n to make out the checks. And they\\n want you to stop in at the bank and\\n give them a specimen signature. Oh,\\n yes, and cosign the note.\"\\n\\n\\n My heart sank. I\\'d never had any\\n dealings with banks except in the\\n matter of mortgages, and bank people\\n make me most uneasy. To say\\n nothing of finding myself responsible\\n for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar\\n note—over two weeks salary. I made\\n a mental vow to sign very few checks.\\n\\n\\n \"So then I stopped by at Apex\\n Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered\\n some paper and envelopes. We\\n hadn\\'t picked a name yesterday, but I\\n figured what\\'s to lose, and picked one.\\n Ridge Industries, how\\'s that?\" Everybody\\n nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"\\n he explained. \"Ridge Industries—Ridgeville—Montana.\"\\n\\n\\n I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,\\n I trust.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can\\'t\\n afford to look chintzy.\"\\nMy appetite was not at its best\\n that evening, and Marjorie recognized\\n that something was concerning\\n me, but she asked no questions, and\\n I only told her about the success of\\n the kite, and the youngsters embarking\\n on a shopping trip for paper, glue\\n and wood splints. There was no use\\n in both of us worrying.\\n\\n\\n On Friday we all got down to work,\\n and presently had a regular production\\n line under way; stapling the\\n wood splints, then wetting them with\\n a resin solution and shaping them\\n over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the\\n plastic film around a pattern, assembling\\n and hanging the finished kites\\n from an overhead beam until the cement\\n had set. Pete Cope had located\\n a big roll of red plastic film from\\n somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking\\n kite. Happily, I didn\\'t know\\n what the film cost until the first kites\\n were sold.\\n\\n\\n By Wednesday of the following\\n week we had almost three hundred\\n kites finished and packed into flat\\n cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn\\'t\\n care if I never saw another. Tommy,\\n who by mutual consent, was our\\n authority on sales, didn\\'t want to sell\\n any until we had, as he put it, enough\\n to meet the demand, but this quantity\\n seemed to satisfy him. He said he\\n would sell them the next week and\\n Mary McCready, with a fine burst of\\n confidence, asked him in all seriousness\\n to be sure to hold out a dozen.\\n\\n\\n Three other things occurred that\\n day, two of which I knew about immediately.\\n Mary brought a portable\\n typewriter from home and spent part\\n of the afternoon banging away at\\n what seemed to me, since I use two\\n fingers only, a very creditable speed.\\n\\n\\n And Hilary brought in a bottle of\\n his new detergent. It was a syrupy\\n yellow liquid with a nice collar of\\n suds. He\\'d been busy in his home\\n laboratory after all, it seemed.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never\\n told us.\"\\n\\n\\n Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl\\n phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in\\n 20% solution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it\\'s been\\n twenty-five years since my last course\\n in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the\\n formula—.\"\\n\\n\\n He gave me a singularly adult\\n smile and jotted down a scrawl of\\n symbols and lines. It meant little to\\n me.\\n\\n\\n \"Is it good?\"\\n\\n\\n For answer he seized the ice bucket,\\n now empty of its soda bottles,\\n trickled in a few drops from the bottle\\n and swished the contents. Foam\\n mounted to the rim and spilled over.\\n \"And that\\'s our best grade of Ridgeville\\n water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest\\n in the country.\"\\n\\n\\n The third event of Wednesday\\n came to my ears on Thursday morning.\\n\\n\\n I was a little late arriving at the\\n barn, and was taken a bit aback to\\n find the roadway leading to it rather\\n full of parked automobiles, and the\\n barn itself rather full of people, including\\n two policemen. Our Ridgeville\\n police are quite young men, but\\n in uniform they still look ominous\\n and I was relieved to see that they\\n were laughing and evidently enjoying\\n themselves.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my\\n best classroom voice. \"What is all\\n this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger\\n policeman asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash\\n bulb went off. A young lady grasped\\n my arm.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come\\n outside where it\\'s quieter and tell me\\n all about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody\\n should tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean you don\\'t know, honestly?\\n Oh, it\\'s fabulous. Best story I\\'ve\\n had for ages. It\\'ll make the city papers.\"\\n She led me around the corner\\n of the barn to a spot of comparative\\n quiet.\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t know that one of your\\n junior whatsisnames poured detergent\\n in the Memorial Fountain basin\\n last night?\"\\n\\n\\n I shook my head numbly.\\n\\n\\n \"It was priceless. Just before rush\\n hour. Suds built up in the basin and\\n overflowed, and down the library\\n steps and covered the whole street.\\n And the funniest part was they kept\\n right on coming. You couldn\\'t imagine\\n so much suds coming from that\\n little pool of water. There was a\\n three-block traffic jam and Harry got\\n us some marvelous pictures—men\\n rolling up their trousers to wade\\n across the street. And this morning,\"\\n she chortled, \"somebody phoned in\\n an anonymous tip to the police—of\\n course it was the same boy that did\\n it—Tommy—Miller?—and so here\\n we are. And we just saw a demonstration\\n of that fabulous kite and saw\\n all those simply captivating mice.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Mice?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. Who would ever\\n have thought you could breed mice\\n with those cute furry tails?\"\\nWell, after a while things quieted\\n down. They had to. The police left\\n after sobering up long enough to\\n give me a serious warning against\\n letting such a thing happen again.\\n Mr. Miller, who had come home to\\n see what all the excitement was, went\\n back to work and Mrs. Miller went\\n back to the house and the reporter\\n and photographer drifted off to file\\n their story, or whatever it is they do.\\n Tommy was jubilant.\\n\\n\\n \"Did you hear what she said? It\\'ll\\n make the city papers. I wish we had\\n a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh\\n boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can\\n you make some more of that stuff?\\n And Doris, how many mice do you\\n have?\"\\n\\n\\n Those mice! I have always kept\\n my enthusiasm for rodents within\\n bounds, but I must admit they were\\n charming little beasts, with tails as\\n bushy as miniature squirrels.\\n\\n\\n \"How many generations?\" I asked\\n Doris.\\n\\n\\n \"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.\\n Want to see the genetic charts?\"\\n\\n\\n I won\\'t try to explain it as she did\\n to me, but it was quite evident that\\n the new mice were breeding true.\\n Presently we asked Betty Miller to\\n come back down to the barn for a\\n conference. She listened and asked\\n questions. At last she said, \"Well, all\\n right, if you promise me they can\\'t\\n get out of their cages. But heaven\\n knows what you\\'ll do when fall\\n comes. They won\\'t live in an unheated\\n barn and you can\\'t bring them\\n into the house.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll be out of the mouse business\\n by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet\\n shop in the country will have\\n them and they\\'ll be down to nothing\\n apiece.\"\\n\\n\\n Doris was right, of course, in spite\\n of our efforts to protect the market.\\n Anyhow that ushered in our cage\\n building phase, and for the next\\n week—with a few interruptions—we\\n built cages, hundreds of them, a good\\n many for breeding, but mostly for\\n shipping.\\n\\n\\n It was rather regrettable that, after\\n the\\nCourier\\ngave us most of the third\\n page, including photographs, we rarely\\n had a day without a few visitors.\\n Many of them wanted to buy mice or\\n kites, but Tommy refused to sell any\\n mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint\\n those who wanted kites. The\\n Supermarket took all we had—except\\n a dozen—and at a dollar fifty\\n each. Tommy\\'s ideas of pricing rather\\n frightened me, but he set the value\\n of the mice at ten dollars a pair\\n and got it without any arguments.\\n\\n\\n Our beautiful stationery arrived,\\n and we had some invoice forms printed\\n up in a hurry—not engraved, for\\n a wonder.\\n\\n\\n It was on Tuesday—following the\\n Thursday—that a lanky young man\\n disentangled himself from his car\\n and strolled into the barn. I looked\\n up from the floor where I was tacking\\n squares of screening onto wooden\\n frames.\\n\\n\\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"You\\'re Donald\\n Henderson, right? My name is McCord—Jeff\\n McCord—and I work in\\n the Patent Section at the Commission\\'s\\n downtown office. My boss sent\\n me over here, but if he hadn\\'t, I\\n think I\\'d have come anyway. What\\n are you doing to get patent protection\\n on Ridge Industries\\' new developments?\"\\n\\n\\n I got my back unkinked and dusted\\n off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,\\n \"I\\'ve been wondering whether something\\n shouldn\\'t be done, but I know\\n very little about such matters—.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed\\n that might be the case, and there are\\n three patent men in our office who\\'d\\n like to chip in and contribute some\\n time. Partly for the kicks and partly\\n because we think you may have some\\n things worth protecting. How about\\n it? You worry about the filing and\\n final fees. That\\'s sixty bucks per\\n brainstorm. We\\'ll worry about everything\\n else.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\\n\\n\\n And so we acquired a patent attorney,\\n several of them, in fact.\\n\\n\\n The day that our application on\\n the kite design went to Washington,\\n Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers\\n scattered from New York to Los\\n Angeles, sent a kite to each one and\\n offered to license the design. Result,\\n one licensee with a thousand dollar\\n advance against next season\\'s royalties.\\nIt was a rainy morning about three\\n weeks later that I arrived at the barn.\\n Jeff McCord was there, and the whole\\n team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his\\n feet from the picnic table and said,\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You\\n look pleased.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious\\n legal sense, of course. Hilary and I\\n were just going over the situation on\\n his phosphonate detergent. I\\'ve spent\\n the last three nights studying the patent\\n literature and a few standard\\n texts touching on phosphonates.\\n There are a zillion patents on synthetic\\n detergents and a good round\\n fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"—he\\n held up a long admonitory hand—\"it\\n just looks as though we had a clear\\n spot. If we do get protection, you\\'ve\\n got a real salable property.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary\\n said, \"but it\\'s not very important.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow\\n at me, and I handed him a small\\n bottle. He opened and sniffed at it\\n gingerly. \"What gives?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told\\n him. \"You\\'ve shaved this morning,\\n but try some anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n Jeff looked momentarily dubious,\\n then puddled some in his palm and\\n moistened his jaw line. \"Smells\\n good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and\\n cool. Now what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a\\n handkerchief and wiped, looked at\\n the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\\n\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each\\n hair brittle enough to break off right\\n at the surface of your skin.\"\\n\\n\\n \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook\\n chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone\\n and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And\\n do your whiskers grow back the next\\n day?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n McCord unfolded his length and\\n stood staring out into the rain. Presently\\n he said, \"Henderson, Hilary\\n and I are heading for my office. We\\n can work there better than here, and\\n if we\\'re going to break the hearts of\\n the razor industry, there\\'s no better\\n time to start than now.\"\\n\\n\\n When they had driven off I turned\\n and said, \"Let\\'s talk a while. We can\\n always clean mouse cages later.\\n Where\\'s Tommy?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get\\n a loan.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What on earth for? We have over\\n six thousand in the account.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little\\n embarrassed, \"we were planning to\\n buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris\\n put some embroidery on that scheme\\n of mine for making ball bearings.\"\\n He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,\\n we make a roller bearing, this shape\\n only it\\'s a permanent magnet. Then\\n you see—.\" And he was off.\\n\\n\\n \"What did they do today, dear?\"\\n Marge asked as she refilled my coffee\\n cup.\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let\\'s see, it was\\n a big day. We picked out a hydraulic\\n press, Doris read us the first chapter\\n of the book she\\'s starting, and we\\n found a place over a garage on\\n Fourth Street that we can rent for\\n winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is\\n starting action to get the company\\n incorporated.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.\\n \"You mean you\\'re going to try to\\n keep the group going after school\\n starts?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why not? The kids can sail\\n through their courses without thinking\\n about them, and actually they\\n won\\'t put in more than a few hours\\n a week during the school year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Even so, it\\'s child labor, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Child labor nothing. They\\'re the\\n employers. Jeff McCord and I will\\n be the only employees—just at first,\\n anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n Marge choked on something. \"Did\\n you say you\\'d be an employee?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They\\'ve offered\\n me a small share of the company,\\n and I\\'d be crazy to turn it down. After\\n all, what\\'s to lose?\"\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAnalog Science Fact &amp; Fiction\\nJuly 1962.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You\\n know how it is. Snead\\'s dead, don\\'t you remember?\"\\n\\n\\n Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What\\n were they trying to pull on him? \"The man who isn\\'t Snead is leaving,\"\\n Linton said, describing the scene over Howell\\'s shoulder. \"If that\\'s\\n Snead\\'s brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Howell said, \"I wouldn\\'t do that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Snead came to Greta\\'s funeral. It\\'s the least I could do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks\\n like him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s practically running,\" Linton said. \"He almost ran out of the\\n restaurant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back\\n intimately against Linton\\'s own chair.\\n\\n\\n \"That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?\" the\\n thick man said.\\n\\n\\n \"Couldn\\'t have been him, though,\" Linton answered automatically. \"My\\n friend\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\\n The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw\\n paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded\\n out of the place quickly.\\n\\n\\n Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton\\'s attention. \"Now\\n you\\'ve probably got old Snead into trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Snead\\'s dead,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, well, \\'dead,\\'\" Howell replied.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you say it like that for?\" Linton demanded angrily. \"The\\n man\\'s dead. Plain dead. He\\'s not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein\\n Monster—there\\'s no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know how it is,\" Howell said.\\n\\n\\n Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,\\n or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on\\n the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he\\n sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had\\n let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had\\n known a genuine affection for her. But it didn\\'t seem he knew about\\n death at all.\\n\\n\\n Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know, mind you,\" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, \"but\\n I suppose he might have been resurrected.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who by?\" Linton asked, thinking:\\nGod?\\n\"The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to\\n life?\" Linton said.\\nHe knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that\\n some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died\\n in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so\\n patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to\\n the surface immediately.\\n\\n\\n \"An invention? I guess that\\'s how it is,\" Howell agreed. \"I don\\'t know\\n much about people like that. I\\'m an honest businessman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s wonderful,\" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.\\n \"Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don\\'t I know\\n about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sh-h,\" Howell said uneasily. \"This is a public place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t understand,\" Linton said helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Frank, you can\\'t legalize a thing like resurrection,\" Howell\\n said with feigned patience. \"There are strong religious convictions to\\n consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I\\'ve heard they got spies right\\n in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is\\n their whole life. You got to realize that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not enough. Not nearly enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.\\n Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They\\'d have to take\\n it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But what do they do about it? Against it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When\\n the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment\\n and arrest everybody in sight. That\\'s about all they can do. The\\n charges, if any, come under general vice classification.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t understand,\" Linton complained. \"Why haven\\'t I heard about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They didn\\'t talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read\\n an article in\\nTime\\nthe other day that said \\'death\\' was our dirty\\n word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, \\'You\\'re going\\n to be dead someday,\\' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The\\n opposite of \\'live\\' these days is \\'video-taped.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been\\n out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be\\n trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.\\n But the temptation was too strong.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?\"\\n\\n\\n Howell looked away. \"Frank, I don\\'t have anything to do with that kind\\n of people and if you\\'re smart, you\\'ll not either.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton\\'s fingers imprinted the linen. \"Damn you, Howell, you tell me!\"\\n\\n\\n Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. \"I take you out to dinner to\\n console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make\\n you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the\\n hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you\\n yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!\"\\n\\n\\n Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as\\n the thick-set man and stalked out.\\n\\n\\n I\\'ve got to hurry too, Linton thought. It\\'s Resurrection Day!\\nThe doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. \"Well,\\n well, Mr. Linton, we understand you\\'ve been causing disturbances.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not really,\" Linton said modestly.\\n\\n\\n \"Come, come,\" the doctor chided. \"You started riots in two places,\\n attempted to bribe an officer. That\\'s disturbing, Mr. Linton, very\\n disturbing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was only trying to find out something,\" Linton maintained. \"They\\n could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor clucked his tongue. \"Let\\'s not think any such thing. People\\n don\\'t know more than you do.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton rubbed his shoulder. \"That cop knew more about Judo holds than I\\n did.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A few specific people know a few specific things you don\\'t. But let me\\n ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein\\'s time asking him a\\n thing like that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You\\n can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person\\n at the right time.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton stared suspiciously. \"Do you know where I can find a\\n resurrectionist?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am a resurrectionist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the policeman brought me to you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, that\\'s what you paid him to do, wasn\\'t it? Did you think a\\n policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are\\n cynics.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really\\n looked at the doctor for the first time.\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, can you\\nreally\\nresurrect the dead?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, I\\'m beginning to believe in you,\" Linton said, \"but tell me,\\n can you resurrect the\\nlong\\ndead?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Size has nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Months?\" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. \"It\\n could be years. Centuries. It\\'s all mathematics, my boy. I need only\\n one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest\\n of it was like and recreate it. It\\'s infallible. Naturally there is a\\n degree of risk involved.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Infallible risk, yes,\" Linton murmured. \"Could you go to work right\\n away?\"\\n\\n\\n \"First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton grasped the situation immediately. \"You mean you want money. You\\n realize I\\'ve just got out of an institution....\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics\\n addiction and more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What a wonderful professional career,\" Linton said, when he couldn\\'t\\n care less.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn\\'t come out broke.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Neither did I,\" Linton said hastily. \"I invested in shifty stocks,\\n faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then—\"\\n\\n\\n \"When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn\\'t found you, I\\n would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All that\\'s ended now,\" the doctor assured him. \"Now we must go dig up\\n the corpse. The female corpse, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n Resurrection Day!\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Linton whispered, \"my mind is singing with battalions of\\n choirs. I hope that doesn\\'t sound irreverent to you.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor stroked his oily palms together. \"Oh, but it does.\\n Beautifully.\"\\nThe certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn\\'t been impossible\\n to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton\\'s fortune and fed\\n them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,\\n smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.\\n\\n\\n Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the\\n olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor\\'s inner-inner\\n sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to\\n prepare himself.\\n\\n\\n Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her\\n body. \"Darling!\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Greta!\" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No\\n doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same\\n way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing\\n her ears the way she enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.\\n She kissed his cheek. \"It\\'s so wonderful to be back. This calls for a\\n celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. \"But tell\\n me—how was it being\\naway\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his\\n Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t remember,\" she said. \"I can\\'t really remember anything. Not\\n really. My memories are ghosts....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, now,\" Linton said, \"we mustn\\'t get excited. You\\'ve been through a\\n trial.\"\\n\\n\\n She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It\\n was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of\\n course it would be; it hadn\\'t changed even in the grave. He remembered\\n the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.\\n\\n\\n \"I must see all our old friends,\" Greta persisted. \"Helen and\\n Johnny....\"\\n\\n\\n \"My darling,\" he said gently, \"about Johnny—\"\\n\\n\\n Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. \"Yes? What about Johnny?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months\\n ago. He was killed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Killed?\" Greta repeated blankly. \"Johnny Gorman was killed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Traffic accident. Killed instantly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn\\'t you have him\\n resurrected the same way you did me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You\\n have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer\\n have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.\"\\n\\n\\n Greta turned her back to him. \"It\\'s just as well. You shouldn\\'t bring\\n back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the\\n photograph of a soul. It\\'s monstrous. No one should do that. No one.\\n But you\\'re\\nsure\\nyou haven\\'t the money to do it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Linton said. \"I\\'m sold out. I\\'ve borrowed on my insurance to the\\n hilt. It won\\'t pay any more until I\\'m buried, and then, of course, you\\n can resurrect me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Greta said. She sighed. \"Poor Johnny. He was such a good\\n friend of yours. You must miss him. I\\'m so sorry for you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have you,\" he said with great simplicity.\\n\\n\\n \"Frank,\" she said, \"you should see that place in there. There are\\n foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals\\n to quench death and smother decay. It\\'s\\nperfect\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It sounds carnal,\" he said uneasily.\\n\\n\\n \"No, dear, it\\'s perfect for some things that have to be done.\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes flashed around the doctor\\'s office and settled somewhere, on\\n something.\\n\\n\\n Linton followed the direction of Greta\\'s gaze and found only an ashtray\\n stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic\\'s idol to a heathen religion on a\\n pedestal.\\n\\n\\n Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him\\n with it over her head.\\n\\n\\n Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.\\n\\n\\n Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.\\nGreta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She\\n writhed against him provocatively. \"Frank, I\\'m sorry, dear, but I have\\n to have that insurance money. It\\'s hell!\"\\n\\n\\n Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that\\n money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles\\n green. No one must ever know.\\n\\n\\n Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face\\n in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and\\n acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.\\n\\n\\n He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.\\n\\n\\n Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and\\n those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in\\n institutional advertising.\\n\\n\\n He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering\\n wreckage.\\n\\n\\n Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat\\n in resurrection. They couldn\\'t chemically revive the old corpse like\\n pouring water on a wilted geranium.\\n\\n\\n Or—\\n\\n\\n Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for\\n if the bodies were used? Didn\\'t the resurrectionists just destroy the\\n old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?\\n\\n\\n But it didn\\'t matter. Not a bit.\\n\\n\\n She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the\\n finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.\\n\\n\\n It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way\\n around.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve killed my wife!\" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching\\n his hands out to something.\\n\\n\\n The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left\\n a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to\\n follow the camel in his turn.\\nHe opened his eyes to the doctor\\'s spotless, well-ordered office. The\\n doctor looked down at him consolingly. \"You\\'ll have to go back, Mr.\\n Linton. But they\\'ll cure you. You\\'ll be cured of ever thinking your\\n wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you\\nreally\\nthink so, Doctor?\" Linton asked hopefully.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But they had to run head-on against a mad\\n genius who had a motto:\\nDeath to all Terrans!\\n\"Let\\'s\\n keep moving,\" I told\\n Val. \"The surest way to\\n die out here on Mars is to\\n give up.\" I reached over and\\n turned up the pressure on her\\n oxymask to make things a\\n little easier for her. Through\\n the glassite of the mask, I\\n could see her face contorted\\n in an agony of fatigue.\\n\\n\\n And she probably thought\\n the failure of the sandcat was\\n all my fault, too. Val\\'s usually\\n about the best wife a guy\\n could ask for, but when she\\n wants to be she can be a real\\n flying bother.\\n\\n\\n It was beyond her to see\\n that some grease monkey back\\n at the Dome was at fault—whoever\\n it was who had failed\\n to fasten down the engine\\n hood. Nothing but what had\\n stopped us\\ncould\\nstop a sandcat:\\n sand in the delicate\\n mechanism of the atomic engine.\\n\\n\\n But no; she blamed it all on\\n me somehow: So we were out\\n walking on the spongy sand\\n of the Martian desert. We\\'d\\n been walking a good eight\\n hours.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t we turn back now,\\n Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe\\n there isn\\'t any uranium in\\n this sector at all. I think\\n we\\'re crazy to keep on searching\\n out here!\"\\n\\n\\n I started to tell her that the\\n UranCo chief had assured me\\n we\\'d hit something out this\\n way, but changed my mind.\\n When Val\\'s tired and overwrought\\n there\\'s no sense in\\n arguing with her.\\n\\n\\n I stared ahead at the bleak,\\n desolate wastes of the Martian\\n landscape. Behind us\\n somewhere was the comfort\\n of the Dome, ahead nothing\\n but the mazes and gullies of\\n this dead world.\\nHe was a cripple in a wheelchair—helpless as a rattlesnake.\\n\"Try to keep going, Val.\"\\n My gloved hand reached out\\n and clumsily enfolded hers.\\n \"Come on, kid. Remember—we\\'re\\n doing this for Earth.\\n We\\'re heroes.\"\\n\\n\\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,\\n hell!\" she muttered. \"That\\'s\\n the way it looked back home,\\n but, out there it doesn\\'t seem\\n so glorious. And UranCo\\'s\\n pay is stinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We didn\\'t come out here\\n for the pay, Val.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, I know, but just\\n the same—\"\\n\\n\\n It must have been hell for\\n her. We had wandered fruitlessly\\n over the red sands all\\n day, both of us listening for\\n the clicks of the counter. And\\n the geigers had been obstinately\\n hushed all day, except\\n for their constant undercurrent\\n of meaningless noises.\\n\\n\\n Even though the Martian\\n gravity was only a fraction of\\n Earth\\'s, I was starting to\\n tire, and I knew it must have\\n been really rough on Val with\\n her lovely but unrugged legs.\\n\\n\\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.\\n \"We\\'re not heroes—we\\'re\\n suckers! Why did I ever let\\n you volunteer for the Geig\\n Corps and drag me along?\"\\n\\n\\n Which wasn\\'t anywhere\\n close to the truth. Now I\\n knew she was at the breaking\\n point, because Val didn\\'t lie\\n unless she was so exhausted\\n she didn\\'t know what she was\\n doing. She had been just as\\n much inflamed by the idea of\\n coming to Mars to help in the\\n search for uranium as I was.\\n We knew the pay was poor,\\n but we had felt it a sort of\\n obligation, something we\\n could do as individuals to\\n keep the industries of radioactives-starved\\n Earth going.\\n And we\\'d always had a roving\\n foot, both of us.\\n\\n\\n No, we had decided together\\n to come to Mars—the\\n way we decided together on\\n everything. Now she was\\n turning against me.\\nI tried to jolly her. \"Buck\\n up, kid,\" I said. I didn\\'t dare\\n turn up her oxy pressure any\\n higher, but it was obvious she\\n couldn\\'t keep going. She was\\n almost sleep-walking now.\\n\\n\\n We pressed on over the\\n barren terrain. The geiger\\n kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,\\n but never broke into\\n that sudden explosive tumult\\n that meant we had found pay-dirt.\\n I started to feel tired\\n myself, terribly tired. I longed\\n to lie down on the soft,\\n spongy Martian sand and\\n bury myself.\\n\\n\\n I looked at Val. She was\\n dragging along with her eyes\\n half-shut. I felt almost guilty\\n for having dragged her out to\\n Mars, until I recalled that I\\n hadn\\'t. In fact, she had come\\n up with the idea before I did.\\n I wished there was some way\\n of turning the weary, bedraggled\\n girl at my side back into\\n the Val who had so enthusiastically\\n suggested we join\\n the Geigs.\\n\\n\\n Twelve steps later, I decided\\n this was about as far as\\n we could go.\\n\\n\\n I stopped, slipped out of\\n the geiger harness, and lowered\\n myself ponderously to\\n the ground. \"What\\'samatter,\\n Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.\\n \"Something wrong?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting\\n out a hand and taking hers.\\n \"I think we ought to rest a\\n little before we go any further.\\n It\\'s been a long, hard\\n day.\"\\n\\n\\n It didn\\'t take much to persuade\\n her. She slid down beside\\n me, curled up, and in a\\n moment she was fast asleep,\\n sprawled out on the sands.\\nPoor kid\\n, I thought. Maybe\\n we shouldn\\'t have come to\\n Mars after all. But, I reminded\\n myself,\\nsomeone\\nhad to do\\n the job.\\n\\n\\n A second thought appeared,\\n but I squelched it:\\n\\n\\n Why the hell me?\\n\\n\\n I looked down at Valerie\\'s\\n sleeping form, and thought of\\n our warm, comfortable little\\n home on Earth. It wasn\\'t\\n much, but people in love don\\'t\\n need very fancy surroundings.\\n\\n\\n I watched her, sleeping\\n peacefully, a wayward lock of\\n her soft blonde hair trailing\\n down over one eyebrow, and\\n it seemed hard to believe that\\n we\\'d exchanged Earth and all\\n it held for us for the raw, untamed\\n struggle that was Mars.\\n But I knew I\\'d do it again, if\\n I had the chance. It\\'s because\\n we wanted to keep what we\\n had. Heroes? Hell, no. We\\n just liked our comforts, and\\n wanted to keep them. Which\\n took a little work.\\nTime to get moving.\\nBut\\n then Val stirred and rolled\\n over in her sleep, and I didn\\'t\\n have the heart to wake her. I\\n sat there, holding her, staring\\n out over the desert, watching\\n the wind whip the sand up\\n into weird shapes.\\n\\n\\n The Geig Corps preferred\\n married couples, working in\\n teams. That\\'s what had finally\\n decided it for us—we were a\\n good team. We had no ties on\\n Earth that couldn\\'t be broken\\n without much difficulty. So\\n we volunteered.\\nAnd here we are.\\nHeroes.\\n The wind blasted a mass of\\n sand into my face, and I felt\\n it tinkle against the oxymask.\\n\\n\\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.\\n Getting late. I decided\\n once again to wake Val.\\n But she was tired. And I was\\n tired too, tired from our\\n wearying journey across the\\n empty desert.\\n\\n\\n I started to shake Val. But\\n I never finished. It would be\\nso\\nnice just to lean back and\\n nuzzle up to her, down in the\\n sand. So nice. I yawned, and\\n stretched back.\\nI awoke with a sudden startled\\n shiver, and realized angrily\\n I had let myself doze off.\\n \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,\\n and started to rise to\\n my feet.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n I looked down. I was neatly\\n bound in thin, tough, plastic\\n tangle-cord, swathed from\\n chin to boot-bottoms, my\\n arms imprisoned, my feet\\n caught. And tangle-cord is\\n about as easy to get out of as\\n a spider\\'s web is for a trapped\\n fly.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t Martians that\\n had done it. There weren\\'t\\n any Martians, hadn\\'t been for\\n a million years. It was some\\n Earthman who had bound us.\\n\\n\\n I rolled my eyes toward\\n Val, and saw that she was\\n similarly trussed in the sticky\\n stuff. The tangle-cord was still\\n fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant\\n odor like that of drying\\n fish. It had been spun on\\n us only a short time ago, I\\n realized.\\n\\n\\n \"Ron—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t try to move, baby.\\n This stuff can break your\\n neck if you twist it wrong.\"\\n She continued for a moment\\n to struggle futilely, and I had\\n to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\\n\\n\\n \"A very wise statement,\"\\n said a brittle, harsh voice\\n from above me. I looked up\\n and saw a helmeted figure\\n above us. He wasn\\'t wearing\\n the customary skin-tight pliable\\n oxysuits we had. He\\n wore an outmoded, bulky\\n spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,\\n all but the face area\\n opaque. The oxygen cannisters\\n weren\\'t attached to his\\n back as expected, though.\\n They were strapped to the\\n back of the wheelchair in\\n which he sat.\\n\\n\\n Through the fishbowl I\\n could see hard little eyes, a\\n yellowed, parchment-like face,\\n a grim-set jaw. I didn\\'t recognize\\n him, and this struck me\\n odd. I thought I knew everyone\\n on sparsely-settled Mars.\\n Somehow I\\'d missed him.\\n\\n\\n What shocked me most was\\n that he had no legs. The\\n spacesuit ended neatly at the\\n thighs.\\n\\n\\n He was holding in his left\\n hand the tanglegun with\\n which he had entrapped us,\\n and a very efficient-looking\\n blaster was in his right.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t want to disturb\\n your sleep,\" he said coldly.\\n \"So I\\'ve been waiting here\\n for you to wake up.\"\\n\\n\\n I could just see it. He might\\n have been sitting there for\\n hours, complacently waiting\\n to see how we\\'d wake up.\\n That was when I realized he\\n must be totally insane. I could\\n feel my stomach-muscles\\n tighten, my throat constrict\\n painfully.\\n\\n\\n Then anger ripped through\\n me, washing away the terror.\\n \"What\\'s going on?\" I demanded,\\n staring at the half\\n of a man who confronted us\\n from the wheelchair. \"Who\\n are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll find out soon\\n enough,\" he said. \"Suppose\\n now you come with me.\" He\\n reached for the tanglegun,\\n flipped the little switch on its\\n side to MELT, and shot a\\n stream of watery fluid over\\n our legs, keeping the blaster\\n trained on us all the while.\\n Our legs were free.\\n\\n\\n \"You may get up now,\" he\\n said. \"Slowly, without trying\\n to make trouble.\" Val and I\\n helped each other to our feet\\n as best we could, considering\\n our arms were still tightly\\n bound against the sides of our\\n oxysuits.\\n\\n\\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,\\n waving the tanglegun to indicate\\n the direction. \"I\\'ll be\\n right behind you.\" He holstered\\n the tanglegun.\\n\\n\\n I glimpsed the bulk of an\\n outboard atomic rigging behind\\n him, strapped to the\\n back of the wheelchair. He\\n fingered a knob on the arm of\\n the chair and the two exhaust\\n ducts behind the wheel-housings\\n flamed for a moment,\\n and the chair began to roll.\\n\\n\\n Obediently, we started\\n walking. You don\\'t argue\\n with a blaster, even if the\\n man pointing it is in a wheelchair.\\n\"What\\'s going on, Ron?\"\\n Val asked in a low voice as we\\n walked. Behind us the wheelchair\\n hissed steadily.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t quite know, Val.\\n I\\'ve never seen this guy before,\\n and I thought I knew\\n everyone at the Dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor\\n called, and we stopped\\n talking. We trudged along together,\\n with him following\\n behind; I could hear the\\ncrunch-crunch\\nof the wheelchair\\n as its wheels chewed\\n into the sand. I wondered\\n where we were going, and\\n why. I wondered why we had\\n ever left Earth.\\n\\n\\n The answer to that came to\\n me quick enough: we had to.\\n Earth needed radioactives,\\n and the only way to get them\\n was to get out and look. The\\n great atomic wars of the late\\n 20th Century had used up\\n much of the supply, but the\\n amount used to blow up half\\n the great cities of the world\\n hardly compared with the\\n amount we needed to put\\n them back together again.\\n\\n\\n In three centuries the shattered\\n world had been completely\\n rebuilt. The wreckage\\n of New York and Shanghai\\n and London and all the other\\n ruined cities had been hidden\\n by a shining new world of\\n gleaming towers and flying\\n roadways. We had profited by\\n our grandparents\\' mistakes.\\n They had used their atomics\\n to make bombs. We used ours\\n for fuel.\\n\\n\\n It was an atomic world.\\n Everything: power drills,\\n printing presses, typewriters,\\n can openers, ocean liners,\\n powered by the inexhaustible\\n energy of the dividing atom.\\n\\n\\n But though the energy is\\n inexhaustible, the supply of\\n nuclei isn\\'t. After three centuries\\n of heavy consumption,\\n the supply failed. The mighty\\n machine that was Earth\\'s industry\\n had started to slow\\n down.\\n\\n\\n And that started the chain\\n of events that led Val and me\\n to end up as a madman\\'s prisoners,\\n on Mars. With every\\n source of uranium mined dry\\n on Earth, we had tried other\\n possibilities. All sorts of\\n schemes came forth. Project\\n Sea-Dredge was trying to get\\n uranium from the oceans. In\\n forty or fifty years, they\\'d\\n get some results, we hoped.\\n But there wasn\\'t forty or\\n fifty years\\' worth of raw stuff\\n to tide us over until then. In a\\n decade or so, our power would\\n be just about gone. I could\\n picture the sort of dog-eat-dog\\n world we\\'d revert back\\n to. Millions of starving, freezing\\n humans tooth-and-clawing\\n in it in the useless shell of\\n a great atomic civilization.\\n\\n\\n So, Mars. There\\'s not much\\n uranium on Mars, and it\\'s not\\n easy to find or any cinch to\\n mine. But what little is there,\\n helps. It\\'s a stopgap effort,\\n just to keep things moving\\n until Project Sea-Dredge\\n starts functioning.\\n\\n\\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers\\n out on the face of\\n Mars, combing for its uranium\\n deposits.\\n\\n\\n And here we are, I thought.\\nAfter we walked on a\\n while, a Dome became visible\\n up ahead. It slid up over the\\n crest of a hill, set back between\\n two hummocks on the\\n desert. Just out of the way\\n enough to escape observation.\\n\\n\\n For a puzzled moment I\\n thought it was our Dome, the\\n settlement where all of UranCo\\'s\\n Geig Corps were located,\\n but another look told me that\\n this was actually quite near\\n us and fairly small. A one-man\\n Dome, of all things!\\n\\n\\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he\\n said. \"The name is Gregory\\n Ledman.\" He herded us off to\\n one side of the airlock, uttered\\n a few words keyed to his\\n voice, and motioned us inside\\n when the door slid up. When\\n we were inside he reached up,\\n clumsily holding the blaster,\\n and unscrewed the ancient\\n spacesuit fishbowl.\\n\\n\\n His face was a bitter,\\n dried-up mask. He was a man\\n who hated.\\n\\n\\n The place was spartanly\\n furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,\\n no decoration of any\\n sort. Hard bulkhead walls,\\n rivet-studded, glared back\\n at us. He had an automatic\\n chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,\\n and no other furniture.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun\\n and sprayed our legs\\n again. We toppled heavily to\\n the floor. I looked up angrily.\\n\"I imagine you want to\\n know the whole story,\" he\\n said. \"The others did, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.\\n Her pretty face was a\\n dead white behind her oxymask.\\n \"What others?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I never bothered to find\\n out their names,\" Ledman\\n said casually. \"They were\\n other Geigs I caught unawares,\\n like you, out on the\\n desert. That\\'s the only sport I\\n have left—Geig-hunting. Look\\n out there.\"\\n\\n\\n He gestured through the\\n translucent skin of the Dome,\\n and I felt sick. There was a\\n little heap of bones lying\\n there, looking oddly bright\\n against the redness of the\\n sands. They were the dried,\\n parched skeletons of Earthmen.\\n Bits of cloth and plastic,\\n once oxymasks and suits, still\\n clung to them.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly I remembered.\\n There had been a pattern\\n there all the time. We didn\\'t\\n much talk about it; we chalked\\n it off as occupational hazards.\\n There had been a pattern\\n of disappearances on the desert.\\n I could think of six, eight\\n names now. None of them\\n had been particularly close\\n friends. You don\\'t get time to\\n make close friends out here.\\n But we\\'d vowed it wouldn\\'t\\n happen to us.\\n\\n\\n It had.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been hunting\\n Geigs?\" I asked. \"\\nWhy?\\nWhat\\'ve they ever done to\\n you?\"\\n\\n\\n He smiled, as calmly as if\\n I\\'d just praised his house-keeping.\\n \"Because I hate\\n you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend\\n to wipe every last one of\\n you out, one by one.\"\\n\\n\\n I stared at him. I\\'d never\\n seen a man like this before; I\\n thought all his kind had died\\n at the time of the atomic\\n wars.\\n\\n\\n I heard Val sob, \"He\\'s a\\n madman!\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.\\n \"I\\'m quite sane, believe me.\\n But I\\'m determined to drive\\n the Geigs—and UranCo—off\\n Mars. Eventually I\\'ll scare\\n you all away.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.\\n \"And I have no fears of an\\n armed attack. This place is\\n well fortified. I\\'ve devoted\\n years to building it. And I\\'m\\n back against those hills. They\\n couldn\\'t pry me out.\" He let\\n his pale hand run up into his\\n gnarled hair. \"I\\'ve devoted\\n years to this. Ever since—ever\\n since I landed here on\\n Mars.\"\\n\"What are you going to do\\n with us?\" Val finally asked,\\n after a long silence.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t smile this time.\\n \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not\\n your husband. I want him as\\n an envoy, to go back and tell\\n the others to clear off.\" He\\n rocked back and forth in his\\n wheelchair, toying with the\\n gleaming, deadly blaster in\\n his hand.\\n\\n\\n We stared in horror. It was\\n a nightmare—sitting there,\\n placidly rocking back and\\n forth, a nightmare.\\n\\n\\n I found myself fervently\\n wishing I was back out there\\n on the infinitely safer desert.\\n\\n\\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.\\n \"I shouldn\\'t—not when\\n you see my motives.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We don\\'t see them,\" I\\n snapped.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, let me show you.\\n You\\'re on Mars hunting uranium,\\n right? To mine and\\n ship the radioactives back to\\n Earth to keep the atomic engines\\n going. Right?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded over at our geiger\\n counters.\\n\\n\\n \"We volunteered to come to\\n Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\\n\\n\\n \"Ah—two young heroes,\"\\n Ledman said acidly. \"How\\n sad. I could almost feel sorry\\n for you. Almost.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just what is it you\\'re\\n after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\\n\\n\\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"\\n he said. \"You remember the\\n Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.\\n I\\'d never forget it. No one\\n would. How could I forget\\n that great accident—killing\\n hundreds, injuring thousands\\n more, sterilizing forty miles\\n of Mississippi land—when\\n the Sadlerville pile went up?\\n\\n\\n \"I was there on business at\\n the time,\" Ledman said. \"I\\n represented Ledman Atomics.\\n I was there to sign a new\\n contract for my company.\\n You know who I am, now?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"I was fairly well shielded\\n when it happened. I never got\\n the contract, but I got a good\\n dose of radiation instead. Not\\n enough to kill me,\" he said.\\n \"Just enough to necessitate\\n the removal of—\" he indicated\\n the empty space at his\\n thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"\\n He gestured at the wheelchair\\n blanket.\\n\\n\\n I still didn\\'t understand.\\n \"But why kill us Geigs?\\nWe\\nhad nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re just in this by accident,\"\\n he said. \"You see, after\\n the explosion and the amputation,\\n my fellow-members on\\n the board of Ledman Atomics\\n decided that a semi-basket\\n case like myself was a poor\\n risk as Head of the Board,\\n and they took my company\\n away. All quite legal, I assure\\n you. They left me almost a\\n pauper!\" Then he snapped\\n the punchline at me.\\n\\n\\n \"They renamed Ledman\\n Atomics. Who did you say you\\n worked for?\"\\n\\n\\n I began, \"Uran—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bother. A more inventive\\n title than Ledman\\n Atomics, but not quite as\\n much heart, wouldn\\'t you\\n say?\" He grinned. \"I saved\\n for years; then I came to\\n Mars, lost myself, built this\\n Dome, and swore to get even.\\n There\\'s not a great deal of\\n uranium on this planet, but\\n enough to keep me in a style\\n to which, unfortunately, I\\'m\\n no longer accustomed.\"\\nHe consulted his wrist\\n watch. \"Time for my injection.\"\\n He pulled out the tanglegun\\n and sprayed us again,\\n just to make doubly certain.\\n \"That\\'s another little souvenir\\n of Sadlerville. I\\'m short\\n on red blood corpuscles.\"\\n\\n\\n He rolled over to a wall\\n table and fumbled in a container\\n among a pile of hypodermics.\\n \"There are other injections,\\n too. Adrenalin, insulin.\\n Others. The Blast turned\\n me into a walking pin-cushion.\\n But I\\'ll pay it all\\n back,\" he said. He plunged\\n the needle into his arm.\\n\\n\\n My eyes widened. It was\\n too nightmarish to be real. I\\n wasn\\'t seriously worried\\n about his threat to wipe out\\n the entire Geig Corps, since\\n it was unlikely that one man\\n in a wheelchair could pick us\\n all off. No, it wasn\\'t the\\n threat that disturbed me, so\\n much as the whole concept, so\\n strange to me, that the human\\n mind could be as warped\\n and twisted as Ledman\\'s.\\n\\n\\n I saw the horror on Val\\'s\\n face, and I knew she felt the\\n same way I did.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you really think you\\n can succeed?\" I taunted him.\\n \"Really think you can kill\\n every Earthman on Mars? Of\\n all the insane, cockeyed—\"\\n\\n\\n Val\\'s quick, worried head-shake\\n cut me off. But Ledman\\n had felt my words, all right.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes! I\\'ll get even with\\n every one of you for taking\\n away my legs! If we hadn\\'t\\n meddled with the atom in the\\n first place, I\\'d be as tall and\\n powerful as you, today—instead\\n of a useless cripple in a\\n wheelchair.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re sick, Gregory Ledman,\"\\n Val said quietly.\\n \"You\\'ve conceived an impossible\\n scheme of revenge and\\n now you\\'re taking it out on\\n innocent people who\\'ve done\\n nothing, nothing at all to you.\\n That\\'s not sane!\"\\n\\n\\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are\\n you to talk of sanity?\"\\nUneasily I caught Val\\'s\\n glance from a corner of my\\n eye. Sweat was rolling down\\n her smooth forehead faster\\n than the auto-wiper could\\n swab it away.\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you do something?\\n What are you waiting\\n for, Ron?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I\\n knew what our ace in the hole\\n was. But I had to get Ledman\\n within reach of me first.\\n\\n\\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I\\'m going\\n to turn you loose outside,\\n right after—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nGet sick!\\n\" I hissed to Val,\\n low. She began immediately\\n to cough violently, emitting\\n harsh, choking sobs. \"Can\\'t\\n breathe!\" She began to yell,\\n writhing in her bonds.\\n\\n\\n That did it. Ledman hadn\\'t\\n much humanity left in him,\\n but there was a little. He lowered\\n the blaster a bit and\\n wheeled one-hand over to see\\n what was wrong with Val.\\n She continued to retch and\\n moan most horribly. It almost\\n convinced me. I saw Val\\'s\\n pale, frightened face turn to\\n me.\\n\\n\\n He approached and peered\\n down at her. He opened his\\n mouth to say something, and\\n at that moment I snapped my\\n leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord\\n with a snicking rasp,\\n and kicked his wheelchair\\n over.\\n\\n\\n The blaster went off, burning\\n a hole through the Dome\\n roof. The automatic sealers\\n glued-in instantly. Ledman\\n went sprawling helplessly out\\n into the middle of the floor,\\n the wheelchair upended next\\n to him, its wheels slowly revolving\\n in the air. The blaster\\n flew from his hands at the\\n impact of landing and spun\\n out near me. In one quick motion\\n I rolled over and covered\\n it with my body.\\nLedman clawed his way to\\n me with tremendous effort\\n and tried wildly to pry the\\n blaster out from under me,\\n but without success. I twisted\\n a bit, reached out with my\\n free leg, and booted him\\n across the floor. He fetched\\n up against the wall of the\\n Dome and lay there.\\n\\n\\n Val rolled over to me.\\n\\n\\n \"Now if I could get free of\\n this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get\\n him covered before he comes\\n to. But how?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She\\n swivelled around on the floor\\n until her head was near my\\n boot. \"Push my oxymask off\\n with your foot, if you can.\"\\n\\n\\n I searched for the clamp\\n and tried to flip it. No luck,\\n with my heavy, clumsy boot.\\n I tried again, and this time it\\n snapped open. I got the tip\\n of my boot in and pried upward.\\n The oxymask came off,\\n slowly, scraping a jagged red\\n scratch up the side of Val\\'s\\n neck as it came.\\n\\n\\n \"There,\" she breathed.\\n \"That\\'s that.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.\\n He was groaning and\\n beginning to stir.\\n\\n\\n Val rolled on the floor and\\n her face lay near my right\\n arm. I saw what she had in\\n mind. She began to nibble the\\n vile-tasting tangle-cord, running\\n her teeth up and down\\n it until it started to give. She\\n continued unfailingly.\\n\\n\\n Finally one strand snapped.\\n Then another. At last I\\n had enough use of my hand\\n to reach out and grasp the\\n blaster. Then I pulled myself\\n across the floor to Ledman,\\n removed the tanglegun, and\\n melted the remaining tangle-cord\\n off.\\n\\n\\n My muscles were stiff and\\n bunched, and rising made me\\n wince. I turned and freed Val.\\n Then I turned and faced Ledman.\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose you\\'ll kill me\\n now,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"No. That\\'s the difference\\n between sane people and insane,\"\\n I told him. \"I\\'m not\\n going to kill you at all. I\\'m\\n going to see to it that you\\'re\\n sent back to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nNo!\\n\" he shouted. \"No!\\n Anything but back there. I\\n don\\'t want to face them again—not\\n after what they did to\\n me—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.\\n \"They\\'ll help you on Earth.\\n They\\'ll take all the hatred and\\n sickness out of you, and turn\\n you into a useful member of\\n society again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat\\n out. \"I hate all of them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.\\n \"You\\'re just all full of\\n hate. You hated us so much\\n that you couldn\\'t bear to hang\\n around on Earth for as much\\n as a year after the Sadlerville\\n Blast. You had to take right\\n off for Mars without a moment\\'s\\n delay, didn\\'t you? You\\n hated Earth so much you\\nhad\\nto leave.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why are you telling all\\n this to me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because if you\\'d stayed\\n long enough, you\\'d have used\\n some of your pension money\\n to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic\\n legs, and then you\\n wouldn\\'t need this wheelchair.\"\\n\\n\\n Ledman scowled, and then\\n his face went belligerent\\n again. \"They told me I was\\n paralyzed below the waist.\\n That I\\'d never walk again,\\n even with prosthetic legs, because\\n I had no muscles to fit\\n them to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"\\n Val said.\\n\\n\\n \"It was the only way,\" he\\n protested. \"I had to get off—\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s right,\" I told him.\\n \"The atom can take away, but\\n it can give as well. Soon after\\n you left they developed\\natomic-powered\\nprosthetics—amazing\\n things, virtually robot\\n legs. All the survivors of\\n the Sadlerville Blast were\\n given the necessary replacement\\n limbs free of charge. All\\n except you. You were so sick\\n you had to get away from the\\n world you despised and come\\n here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re lying,\" he said.\\n \"It\\'s not true!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\\n\\n\\n I saw him wilt visibly, and\\n for a moment I almost felt\\n sorry for him, a pathetic legless\\n figure propped up against\\n the wall of the Dome at\\n blaster-point. But then I remembered\\n he\\'d killed twelve\\n Geigs—or more—and would\\n have added Val to the number\\n had he had the chance.\\n\"You\\'re a very sick man,\\n Ledman,\" I said. \"All this\\n time you could have been\\n happy, useful on Earth, instead\\n of being holed up here\\n nursing your hatred. You\\n might have been useful, on\\n Earth. But you decided to\\n channel everything out as revenge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I still don\\'t believe it—those\\n legs. I might have walked\\n again. No—no, it\\'s all a lie.\\n They told me I\\'d never walk,\"\\n he said, weakly but stubbornly\\n still.\\n\\n\\n I could see his whole structure\\n of hate starting to topple,\\n and I decided to give it\\n the final push.\\n\\n\\n \"Haven\\'t you wondered\\n how I managed to break the\\n tangle-cord when I kicked you\\n over?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes—human legs aren\\'t\\n strong enough to break tangle-cord\\n that way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I\\n gave Val the blaster and slipped\\n out of my oxysuit.\\n \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to\\n my smooth, gleaming metal\\n legs. The almost soundless\\n purr of their motors was the\\n only noise in the room. \"I was\\n in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"\\n I said. \"But I didn\\'t go crazy\\n with hate when I lost\\nmy\\nlegs.\"\\n\\n\\n Ledman was sobbing.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.\\n Val got him into his suit, and\\n brought him the fishbowl helmet.\\n \"Get your helmet on and\\n let\\'s go. Between the psychs\\n and the prosthetics men,\\n you\\'ll be a new man inside of\\n a year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I\\'m a murderer!\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right. And you\\'ll be\\n sentenced to psych adjustment.\\n When they\\'re finished,\\n Gregory Ledman the killer\\n will be as dead as if they\\'d\\n electrocuted you, but there\\'ll\\n be a new—and sane—Gregory\\n Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\\n\\n\\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\\n\\n\\n For the first time since\\n Ledman had caught us, I remembered\\n how tired Val had\\n been out on the desert. I realized\\n now that I had been driving\\n her mercilessly—me, with\\n my chromium legs and atomic-powered\\n muscles. No wonder\\n she was ready to fold!\\n And I\\'d been too dense to see\\n how unfair I had been.\\n\\n\\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,\\n and I put Ledman\\n back in his wheelchair.\\n\\n\\n Val slipped her oxymask\\n back on and fastened it shut.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get back to the Dome\\n in a hurry,\" I said. \"We\\'ll\\n turn Ledman over to the authorities.\\n Then we can catch\\n the next ship for Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go back?\\nGo back?\\nIf you\\n think I\\'m backing down now\\n and quitting you can find\\n yourself another wife! After\\n we dump this guy I\\'m sacking\\n in for twenty hours, and then\\n we\\'re going back out there to\\n finish that search-pattern.\\n Earth needs uranium, honey,\\n and I know you\\'d never be\\n happy quitting in the middle\\n like that.\" She smiled. \"I\\n can\\'t wait to get out there\\n and start listening for those\\n tell-tale clicks.\"\\n\\n\\n I gave a joyful whoop and\\n swung her around. When I\\n put her down, she squeezed\\n my hand, hard.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get moving, fellow\\n hero,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the stud for the\\n airlock, smiling.\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Stories\\nSeptember 1956.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\\nTO EACH HIS STAR\\nby\\nBRYCE WALTON\\n\"Nothing around those other suns but ashes and dried\\n blood,\" old Dunbar told the space-wrecked, desperate men.\\n \"Only one way to go, where we can float down through the\\n clouds to Paradise. That\\'s straight ahead to the sun with\\n the red rim around it.\"\\nBut Dunbar\\'s eyes were old and uncertain. How could they\\n believe in his choice when every star in this forsaken\\n section of space was surrounded by a beckoning red rim?\\nThere was just blackness, frosty glimmering terrible blackness, going\\n out and out forever in all directions. Russell didn\\'t think they could\\n remain sane in all this blackness much longer. Bitterly he thought of\\n how they would die—not knowing within maybe thousands of light years\\n where they were, or where they were going.\\n\\n\\n After the wreck, the four of them had floated a while, floated and\\n drifted together, four men in bulbous pressure suits like small\\n individual rockets, held together by an awful pressing need for each\\n other and by the \"gravity-rope\" beam.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar, the oldest of the four, an old space-buster with a face\\n wrinkled like a dried prune, burned by cosmic rays and the suns of\\n worlds so far away they were scarcely credible, had taken command.\\n Suddenly, Old Dunbar had known where they were. Suddenly, Dunbar knew\\n where they were going.\\n\\n\\n They could talk to one another through the etheric transmitters inside\\n their helmets. They could live ... if this was living ... a long time,\\n if only a man\\'s brain would hold up, Russell thought. The suits were\\n complete units. 700 pounds each, all enclosing shelters, with\\n atmosphere pressure, temperature control, mobility in space, and\\n electric power. Each suit had its own power-plant, reprocessing\\n continuously the precious air breathed by the occupants, putting it\\n back into circulation again after enriching it. Packed with food\\n concentrates. Each suit a rocket, each human being part of a rocket,\\n and the special \"life-gun\" that went with each suit each blast of\\n which sent a man a few hundred thousand miles further on toward\\n wherever he was going.\\n\\n\\n Four men, thought Russell, held together by an invisible string of\\n gravity, plunging through a lost pocket of hell\\'s dark where there had\\n never been any sound or life, with old Dunbar the first in line,\\n taking the lead because he was older and knew where he was and where\\n he was going. Maybe Johnson, second in line, and Alvar who was third,\\n knew too, but were afraid to admit it.\\n\\n\\n But Russell knew it and he\\'d admitted it from the first—that old\\n Dunbar was as crazy as a Jovian juke-bird.\\n\\n\\n A lot of time had rushed past into darkness. Russell had no idea now\\n how long the four of them had been plunging toward the red-rimmed sun\\n that never seemed to get any nearer. When the ultra-drive had gone\\n crazy the four of them had blanked out and nobody could say now how\\n long an interim that had been. Nobody knew what happened to a man who\\n suffered a space-time warping like that. When they had regained\\n consciousness, the ship was pretty banged up, and the meteor-repeller\\n shields cracked. A meteor ripped the ship down the center like an old\\n breakfast cannister.\\n\\n\\n How long ago that had been, Russell didn\\'t know. All Russell knew was\\n that they were millions of light years from any place he had ever\\n heard about, where the galactic space lanterns had absolutely no\\n recognizable pattern. But Dunbar knew. And Russell was looking at\\n Dunbar\\'s suit up ahead, watching it more and more intently, thinking\\n about how Dunbar looked inside that suit—and hating Dunbar more and\\n more for claiming he knew when he didn\\'t, for his drooling\\n optimism—because he was taking them on into deeper darkness and\\n calling their destination Paradise.\\n\\n\\n Russell wanted to laugh, but the last time he\\'d given way to this\\n impulse, the results inside his helmet had been too unpleasant to\\n repeat.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes Russell thought of other things besides his growing hatred\\n of the old man. Sometimes he thought about the ship, lost back there\\n in the void, and he wondered if wrecked space ships were ever found.\\n Compared with the universe in which one of them drifted, a wrecked\\n ship was a lot smaller than a grain of sand on a nice warm beach back\\n on Earth, or one of those specks of silver dust that floated like\\n strange seeds down the night winds of Venus.\\n\\n\\n And a human was smaller still, thought Russell when he was not hating\\n Dunbar. Out here, a human being is the smallest thing of all. He\\n thought then of what Dunbar would say to such a thought, how Dunbar\\n would laugh that high piping squawking laugh of his and say that the\\n human being was bigger than the Universe itself.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar had a big answer for every little thing.\\n\\n\\n When the four of them had escaped from that prison colony on a\\n sizzling hot asteroid rock in the Ronlwhyn system, that wasn\\'t enough\\n for Dunbar. Hell no—Dunbar had to start talking about a place they\\n could go where they\\'d never be apprehended, in a system no one else\\n had ever heard of, where they could live like gods on a green soft\\n world like the Earth had been a long time back.\\n\\n\\n And Dunbar had spouted endlessly about a world of treasure they would\\n find, if they would just follow old Dunbar. That\\'s what all four of\\n them had been trying to find all their lives in the big cold grabbag\\n of eternity—a rich star, a rich far fertile star where no one else\\n had ever been, loaded with treasure that had no name, that no one had\\n ever heard of before. And was, because of that, the richest treasure\\n of all.\\n\\n\\n We all look alike out here in these big rocket pressure suits, Russell\\n thought. No one for God only knew how many of millions of light years\\n away could see or care. Still—we might have a chance to live, even\\n now, Russell thought—if it weren\\'t for old crazy Dunbar.\\n\\n\\n They might have a chance if Alvar and Johnson weren\\'t so damn lacking\\n in self-confidence as to put all their trust in that crazed old\\n rum-dum. Russell had known now for some time that they were going in\\n the wrong direction. No reason for knowing. Just a hunch. And Russell\\n was sure his hunch was right.\\nRussell said. \"Look—look to your left and to your right and behind\\n us. Four suns. You guys see those other three suns all around you,\\n don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" someone said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if you\\'ll notice,\" Russell said, \"the one on the left also now\\n has a red rim around it. Can\\'t you guys see that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, I see it,\" Alvar said.\\n\\n\\n \"So now,\" Johnson said, \"there\\'s two suns with red rims around them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re about in the middle of those four suns aren\\'t we, Dunbar?\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, boys!\" yelled old Dunbar in that sickeningly optimistic\\n voice. Like a hysterical old woman\\'s. \"Just about in the sweet dark\\n old middle.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re still sure it\\'s the sun up ahead ... that\\'s the only one with\\n life on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?\" Russell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right! That\\'s right,\" Dunbar yelled. \"That\\'s the only one—and\\n it\\'s a paradise. Not just a place to live, boys—but a place you\\'ll\\n have trouble believing in because it\\'s like a dream!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And none of these other three suns have worlds we could live on,\\n Dunbar?\" Russell asked. Keep the old duck talking like this and maybe\\n Alvar and Johnson would see that he was cracked.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"You still say that, Dunbar?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No life, boys, nothing,\" Dunbar laughed. \"Nothing on these other\\n worlds but ashes ... just ashes and iron and dried blood, dried a\\n million years or more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When in hell were you ever here?\" Johnson said. \"You say you were\\n here before. You never said when, or why or anything!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was a long time back boys. Don\\'t remember too well, but it was\\n when we had an old ship called the DOG STAR that I was here. A pirate\\n ship and I was second in command, and we came through this sector.\\n That was—hell, it musta\\' been fifty years ago. I been too many places\\n nobody\\'s ever bothered to name or chart, to remember where it is, but\\n I been here. I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect\\n circle from this point, with us squarely in the middle. We explored\\n all these suns and the worlds that go round \\'em. Trust me, boys, and\\n we\\'ll reach the right one. And that one\\'s just like Paradise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Paradise is it,\" Russell whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n \"Paradise and there we\\'ll be like gods, like Mercuries with wings\\n flying on nights of sweet song. These other suns, don\\'t let them\\n bother you. They\\'re Jezebels of stars. All painted up in the darkness\\n and pretty and waiting and calling and lying! They make you think of\\n nice green worlds all running waters and dews and forests thick as\\n fleas on a wet dog. But it ain\\'t there, boys. I know this place. I\\n been here, long time back.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell said tightly. \"It\\'ll take us a long time won\\'t it? If it\\'s got\\n air we can breath, and water we can drink and shade we can rest\\n in—that\\'ll be paradise enough for us. But it\\'ll take a long time\\n won\\'t it? And what if it isn\\'t there—what if after all the time we\\n spend hoping and getting there—there won\\'t be nothing but ashes and\\n cracked clay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know we\\'re going right,\" Dunbar said cheerfully. \"I can tell. Like\\n I said—you can tell it because of the red rim around it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the sun on our left, you can see—it\\'s got a red rim too now,\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Alvar. \"Sometimes I see a red rim around\\n the one we\\'re going for, sometimes a red rim around that one on the\\n left. Now, sometimes I\\'m not sure either of them\\'s got a red rim. You\\n said that one had a red rim, Dunbar, and I wanted to believe it. So\\n now maybe we\\'re all seeing a red rim that was never there.\"\\n\\n\\n Old Dunbar laughed. The sound brought blood hotly to Russell\\'s face.\\n \"We\\'re heading to the right one, boys. Don\\'t doubt me ... I been here.\\n We explored all these sun systems. And I remember it all. The second\\n planet from that red-rimmed sun. You come down through a soft\\n atmosphere, floating like in a dream. You see the green lakes coming\\n up through the clouds and the women dancing and the music playing. I\\n remember seeing a ship there that brought those women there, a long\\n long time before ever I got there. A land like heaven and women like\\n angels singing and dancing and laughing with red lips and arms white\\n as milk, and soft silky hair floating in the winds.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell was very sick of the old man\\'s voice. He was at least glad he\\n didn\\'t have to look at the old man now. His bald head, his skinny\\n bobbing neck, his simpering watery blue eyes. But he still had to\\n suffer that immutable babbling, that idiotic cheerfulness ... and\\n knowing all the time the old man was crazy, that he was leading them\\n wrong.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d break away, go it alone to the right sun, Russell thought—but I\\'d\\n never make it alone. A little while out here alone and I\\'d be nuttier\\n than old Dunbar will ever be, even if he keeps on getting nuttier all\\n the time.\\n\\n\\n Somewhere, sometime then ... Russell got the idea that the only way\\n was to get rid of Dunbar.\\nYou mean to tell us there are people living by that red-rimmed sun,\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"Lost people ... lost ... who knows how long,\" Dunbar said, as the\\n four of them hurtled along. \"You never know where you\\'ll find people\\n on a world somewhere nobody\\'s ever named or knows about. Places where\\n a lost ship\\'s landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far\\n off the lanes they\\'ll never be found except by accident for millions\\n of years. That\\'s what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load\\n of beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled\\n to some outpost to entertain. They\\'re like angels now, living in a\\n land all free from care. Every place you see green forests and fields\\n and blue lakes, and at nights there\\'s three moons that come around the\\n sky in a thousand different colors. And it never gets cold ... it\\'s\\n always spring, always spring, boys, and the music plays all night,\\n every night of a long long year....\"\\n\\n\\n Russell suddenly shouted. \"Keep quiet, Dunbar. Shut up will you?\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson said. \"Dunbar—how long\\'ll it take us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Six months to a year, I\\'d say,\" Dunbar yelled happily. \"That is—of\\n our hereditary time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" croaked Alvar.\\n\\n\\n Johnson didn\\'t say anything at all.\\n\\n\\n Russell screamed at Dunbar, then quieted down. He whispered. \"Six\\n months to a year—out here—cooped up in these damn suits. You\\'re\\n crazy as hell, Dunbar. Crazy ... crazy! Nobody could stand it. We\\'ll\\n all be crazier than you are—\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll make it, boys. Trust ole\\' Dunbar. What\\'s a year when we know\\n we\\'re getting to Paradise at the end of it? What\\'s a year out here ...\\n it\\'s paradise ain\\'t it, compared with that prison hole we were rotting\\n in? We can make it. We have the food concentrates, and all the rest.\\n All we need\\'s the will, boys, and we got that. The whole damn Universe\\n isn\\'t big enough to kill the will of a human being, boys. I been over\\n a whole lot of it, and I know. In the old days—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The hell with the old days,\" screamed Russell.\\n\\n\\n \"Now quiet down, Russ,\" Dunbar said in a kind of dreadful crooning\\n whisper. \"You calm down now. You younger fellows—you don\\'t look at\\n things the way we used to. Thing is, we got to go straight. People\\n trapped like this liable to start meandering. Liable to start losing\\n the old will-power.\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"Someone says maybe we ought to go left, and\\n someone says to go right, and someone else says to go in another\\n direction. And then someone says maybe they\\'d better go back the old\\n way. An\\' pretty soon something breaks, or the food runs out, and\\n you\\'re a million million miles from someplace you don\\'t care about any\\n more because you\\'re dead. All frozen up in space ... preserved like a\\n piece of meat in a cold storage locker. And then maybe in a million\\n years or so some lousy insect man from Jupiter comes along and finds\\n you and takes you away to a museum....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up!\" Johnson yelled.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar laughed. \"Boys, boys, don\\'t get panicky. Keep your heads. Just\\n stick to old Dunbar and he\\'ll see you through. I\\'m always lucky. Only\\n one way to go ... an\\' that\\'s straight ahead to the sun with the\\n red-rim around it ... and then we tune in the gravity repellers, and\\n coast down, floating and singing down through the clouds to\\n paradise.\"\\n\\n\\n After that they traveled on for what seemed months to Russell, but it\\n couldn\\'t have been over a day or two of the kind of time-sense he had\\n inherited from Earth.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw how the other two stars also were beginning to develop red\\n rims. He yelled this fact out to the others. And Alvar said. \"Russ\\'s\\n right. That sun to the right, and the one behind us ... now they ALL\\n have red rims around them. Dunbar—\" A pause and no awareness of\\n motion.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar laughed. \"Sure, they all maybe have a touch of red, but it\\n isn\\'t the same, boys. I can tell the difference. Trust me—\"\\n\\n\\n Russell half choked on his words. \"You old goat! With those old eyes\\n of yours, you couldn\\'t see your way into a fire!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t get panicky now. Keep your heads. In another year, we\\'ll be\\n there—\"\\n\\n\\n \"God, you gotta\\' be sure,\" Alvar said. \"I don\\'t mind dyin\\' out here.\\n But after a year of this, and then to get to a world that was only\\n ashes, and not able to go any further—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always come through, boys. I\\'m lucky. Angel women will take us to\\n their houses on the edges of cool lakes, little houses that sit there\\n in the sun like fancy jewels. And we\\'ll walk under colored fountains,\\n pretty colored fountains just splashing and splashing like pretty rain\\n on our hungry hides. That\\'s worth waiting for.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell did it before he hardly realized he was killing the old man.\\n It was something he had had to do for a long time and that made it\\n easy. There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of\\n Dunbar. If he\\'d aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have\\n pierced Dunbar\\'s back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished\\n automatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated,\\n self-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them\\n hurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front\\n of the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead.\\n\\n\\n He was dead and his mouth was shut for good.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar\\'s last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell\\'s\\n ears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and\\n Johnson both called Dunbar\\'s name a few times. There was no answer.\\n\\n\\n \"Russ—you shouldn\\'t have done that,\" Johnson whispered. \"You\\n shouldn\\'t have done that to the old man!\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Alvar said, so low he could barely be heard. \"You shouldn\\'t have\\n done it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I did it for the three of us,\" Russell said. \"It was either him or us.\\n Lies ... lies that was all he had left in his crazy head. Paradise ...\\n don\\'t tell me you guys don\\'t see the red rims around all four suns, all\\n four suns all around us. Don\\'t tell me you guys didn\\'t know he was batty,\\n that you really believed all that stuff he was spouting all the time!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was lying, maybe not,\" Johnson said. \"Now he\\'s dead anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was wrong, crazy, full of lies,\" Alvar said. \"But now he\\'s\\n dead.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How could he see any difference in those four stars?\" Russell said,\\n louder.\\n\\n\\n \"He thought he was right,\" Alvar said. \"He wanted to take us to\\n paradise. He was happy, nothing could stop the old man—but he\\'s dead\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n He sighed.\\n\\n\\n \"He was taking us wrong ... wrong!\" Russell screamed. \"Angels—music\\n all night—houses like jewels—and women like angels—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nShhhh\\n,\" said Alvar. It was quiet. How could it be so quiet, Russell\\n thought? And up ahead the old man\\'s pressure suit with a corpse inside\\n went on ahead, leading the other three at the front of the\\n gravity-rope.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was wrong,\" Alvar said. \"But now do we know which way is\\n right?\"\\nSometime later, Johnson said, \"We got to decide now. Let\\'s forget the\\n old man. Let\\'s forget him and all that\\'s gone and let\\'s start now and\\n decide what to do.\"\\n\\n\\n And Alvar said, \"Guess he was crazy all right, and I guess we trusted\\n him because we didn\\'t have the strength to make up our own minds. Why\\n does a crazy man\\'s laugh sound so good when you\\'re desperate and don\\'t\\n know what to do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always had a feeling we were going wrong,\" Johnson said. \"Anyway,\\n it\\'s forgotten, Russ. It\\'s swallowed up in the darkness all around.\\n It\\'s never been.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell said, \"I\\'ve had a hunch all along that maybe the old man was\\n here before, and that he was right about there being a star here with\\n a world we can live on. But I\\'ve known we was heading wrong. I\\'ve had\\n a hunch all along that the right star was the one to the left.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know,\" Johnson sighed. \"I been feeling partial toward that\\n one on the right. What about you, Alvar?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always thought we were going straight in the opposite direction\\n from what we should, I guess. I always wanted to turn around and go\\n back. It won\\'t make over maybe a month\\'s difference. And what does a\\n month matter anyway out here—hell there never was any time out here\\n until we came along. We make our own time here, and a month don\\'t\\n matter to me.\"\\n\\n\\n Sweat ran down Russell\\'s face. His voice trembled. \"No—that\\'s wrong.\\n You\\'re both wrong.\" He could see himself going it alone. Going crazy\\n because he was alone. He\\'d have broken away, gone his own direction,\\n long ago but for that fear.\\n\\n\\n \"How can we tell which of us is right?\" Alvar said. \"It\\'s like\\n everything was changing all the time out here. Sometimes I\\'d swear\\n none of those suns had red rims, and at other times—like the old man\\n said, they\\'re all pretty and lying and saying nothing, just changing\\n all the time. Jezebel stars, the old man said.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know I\\'m right,\" Russell pleaded. \"My hunches always been right.\\n My hunch got us out of that prison didn\\'t it? Listen—I tell you it\\'s\\n that star to the left—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The one to the right,\" said Johnson.\\n\\n\\n \"We been going away from the right one all the time,\" said Alvar.\\n\\n\\n \"We got to stay together,\" said Russell. \"Nobody could spend a year\\n out here ... alone....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah ... in another month or so we\\'d be lousy company anyway,\" Alvar\\n said. \"Maybe a guy could get to the point where he\\'d sleep most of the\\n time ... just wake up enough times to give himself another boost with\\n the old life-gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We got to face it,\" Johnson said finally. \"We three don\\'t go on\\n together any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s it,\" said Alvar. \"There\\'s three suns that look like they might\\n be right seeing as how we all agree the old man was wrong. But we\\n believe there is one we can live by, because we all seem to agree that\\n the old man might have been right about that. If we stick together,\\n the chance is three to one against us. But if each of us makes for one\\n star, one of us has a chance to live. Maybe not in paradise like the\\n old man said, but a place where we can live. And maybe there\\'ll be\\n intelligent life, maybe even a ship, and whoever gets the right star\\n can come and help the other two....\"\\n\\n\\n \"No ... God no....\" Russell whispered over and over. \"None of us can\\n ever make it alone....\"\\n\\n\\n Alvar said, \"We each take the star he likes best. I\\'ll go back the\\n other way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the\\n right.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and\\n above his own yelling he could hear Johnson\\'s rising laughter. \"Every\\n guy\\'s got a star of his own,\" Johnson said when he stopped laughing.\\n \"And we got ours. A nice red-rimmed sun for each of us to call his\\n very own.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Alvar said. \"We cut off the gravity rope, and each to his own\\n sun.\"\\n\\n\\n Now Russell wasn\\'t saying anything.\\n\\n\\n \"And the old man,\" Alvar said, \"can keep right on going toward what he\\n thought was right. And he\\'ll keep on going. Course he won\\'t be able to\\n give himself another boost with the life-gun, but he\\'ll keep going.\\n Someday he\\'ll get to that red-rimmed star of his. Out here in space,\\n once you\\'re going, you never stop ... and I guess there isn\\'t any\\n other body to pull him off his course. And what will time matter to\\n old Dunbar? Even less than to us, I guess. He\\'s dead and he won\\'t\\n care.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready,\" Johnson said. \"I\\'ll cut off the gravity rope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m ready,\" Alvar said. \"To go back toward whatever it was I started\\n from.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready, Russ?\"\\n\\n\\n Russell couldn\\'t say anything. He stared at the endless void which now\\n he would share with no one. Not even crazy old Dunbar.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Johnson said. \"Good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell felt the release, felt the sudden inexplicable isolation and\\n aloneness even before Alvar and Johnson used their life-guns and shot\\n out of sight, Johnson toward the left and Alvar back toward that other\\n red-rimmed sun behind them.\\n\\n\\n And old Dunbar shooting right on ahead. And all three of them\\n dwindling and dwindling and blinking out like little lights.\\n\\n\\n Fading, he could hear their voices. \"Each to his own star,\" Johnson\\n said. \"On a bee line.\"\\n\\n\\n \"On a bee line,\" Alvar said.\\n\\n\\n Russell used his own life-gun and in a little while he didn\\'t hear\\n Alvar or Johnson\\'s voices, nor could he see them. They were thousands\\n of miles away, and going further all the time.\\n\\n\\n Russell\\'s head fell forward against the front of his helmet, and he\\n closed his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"I shouldn\\'t have killed the old\\n man. Maybe one sun\\'s as good as another....\"\\n\\n\\n Then he raised his body and looked out into the year of blackness that\\n waited for him, stretching away to the red-rimmed sun. Even if he were\\n right—he was sure now he\\'d never make it alone.\\nThe body inside the pressure suit drifted into a low-level orbit\\n around the second planet from the sun of its choice, and drifted there\\n a long time. A strato-cruiser detected it by chance because of the\\n strong concentration of radio-activity that came from it.\\n\\n\\n They took the body down to one of the small, quiet towns on the edge\\n of one of the many blue lakes where the domed houses were like bright\\n joyful jewels. They got the leathery, well-preserved body from the\\n pressure suit.\\n\\n\\n \"An old man,\" one of them mused. \"A very old man. From one of the lost\\n sectors. I wonder how and why he came so very far from his home?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wrecked a ship out there, probably,\" one of the others said. \"But he\\n managed to get this far. It looks as though a small meteor fragment\\n pierced his body. Here. You see?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" another of them said. \"But what amazes me is that this old man\\n picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire\\n sector that would sustain life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains\\n such an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about\\n the lost sectors.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he knew the way here. Maybe he was here before—sometime.\"\\n\\n\\n The other shook his head. \"I don\\'t think so. They say some humans from\\n that far sector did land here—but that\\'s probably only a myth. And if\\n they did, it was well over a thousand years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n Another said. \"He has a fine face, this old man. A noble face. Whoever\\n he is ... wherever he came from, he died bravely and he knew the way,\\n though he never reached this haven of the lost alive.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nor is it irony that he reached here dead,\" said the Lake Chieftain.\\n He had been listening and he stepped forward and raised his arm. \"He\\n was old. It is obvious that he fought bravely, that he had great\\n courage, and that he knew the way. He will be given a burial suitable\\n to his stature, and he will rest here among the brave.\\n\\n\\n \"Let the women dance and the music play for this old man. Let the\\n trumpets speak, and the rockets fly up. And let flowers be strewn over\\n the path above which the women will carry him to rest.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Interstellar was new and they wanted him on the ship\\n because he was a trained observer. They wanted facts, not gibberish.\\n But to ask a man to give up two years of his life—well, that was\\n asking a lot. Two years in a sardine can. Still, it had an appeal Keith\\n Ellason knew he couldn\\'t deny, a newsman\\'s joy of the clean beat, a\\n planetary system far afield, a closeup view of the universe, history in\\n the making.\\n\\n\\n Interstellar Chief Rexroad knocked the dottle from his pipe in a tray,\\n saying, \"Transworld Press is willing to let you have a leave of\\n abscence, if you\\'re interested.\"\\n\\n\\n He knew Secretary Phipps from years of contacting, and now Phipps said,\\n \"Personally, I don\\'t want to see anybody else on the job. You\\'ve got a\\n fine record in this sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Keith Ellason smiled, but just barely. \"You should have called me for\\n the first trip.\"\\n\\n\\n Phipps nodded. \"I wish we had had you on the\\nWeblor I\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Crewmen,\" Rexroad said, \"make poor reporters.\"\\n\\n\\n The\\nWeblor I\\nhad taken off on the first trip to Antheon five years\\n before with a thousand families, reached the planet with less than five\\n hundred surviving colonists. Upon the return to Earth a year later, the\\n crew\\'s report of suffering and chaos during the year\\'s outgoing voyage\\n was twisted, distorted and fragmentary. Ellason remembered it well. The\\n decision of Interstellar was that the colonists started a revolution\\n far out in space, that it was fanned by the ignorance of Captain\\n Sessions in dealing with such matters.\\n\\n\\n \"Space affects men in a peculiar way,\" Phipps said. \"We have conquered\\n the problem of small groups in space—witness the discovery of\\n Antheon, for example—but when there are large groups, control is more\\n difficult.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sessions,\" Rexroad said, \"was a bully. The trouble started at about\\n the halfway point. It ended with passengers engaging in open warfare\\n with each other and the crew. Sessions was lucky to escape with his\\n life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As I recall,\" Ellason said, \"there was something about stunners.\"\\n\\n\\n Phipps rubbed his chin. \"No weapons were allowed on the ship, but you\\n must remember the colonists were selected for their intelligence and\\n resourcefulness. They utilized these attributes to set up weapon shops\\n to arm themselves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The second trip is history,\" Rexroad said. \"And a puzzle.\"\\nEllason nodded. \"The ship disappeared.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. We gave control to the colonists.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Assuming no accident in space,\" Phipps said, \"it was a wrong decision.\\n They probably took over the ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And now,\" Ellason said, \"you\\'re going to try again.\"\\n\\n\\n Rexroad said very gravely, \"We\\'ve got the finest captain in\\n Interplanetary. Harvey Branson. No doubt you\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s\\n spent his life in our own system, and he\\'s handpicking his own crew. We\\n have also raised prerequisites for applicants. We don\\'t think anything\\n is going to happen, but if it does, we want to get an impersonal,\\n unprejudiced view. That\\'s where you come in. You do the observing, the\\n reporting. We\\'ll evaluate it on your return.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I return,\" said Ellason.\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose that\\'s problematical,\" Phipps said, \"but I think you will.\\n Captain Branson and his fifty crewmen want to return as badly as you\\n do.\" He grinned. \"You can write that novel you\\'re always talking about\\n on your return trip on the\\nWeblor II\\n.\"\\nBeing a Nilly is important, probably as important as running the ship,\\n and I think it is this thought that keeps us satisfied, willing to be\\n what we are.\\nThe\\nWeblor II\\nhad been built in space, as had its predecessor, the\\nWeblor I\\n, at a tremendous cost. Basically, it was an instrument\\n which would open distant vistas to colonization, reducing the\\n shoulder-to-shoulder pressure of a crowded solar system. A gigantic,\\n hollow spike, the ship would never land anywhere, but would circle\\n Antheon as it circled Earth, shuttling its cargo and passengers to the\\n promised land, the new frontier. A space-borne metropolis, it would\\n be the home for three thousand persons outward bound, only the crew\\n on the return trip. It was equipped with every conceivable facility\\n and comfort—dining rooms, assembly hall, individual and family\\n compartments, recreation areas, swimming pool, library, theater.\\n Nothing had been overlooked.\\n\\n\\n The captain\\'s briefing room was crowded, the air was heavy with the\\n breathing of so many men, and the ventilators could not quite clear the\\n air of tobacco smoke that drifted aimlessly here and there before it\\n was caught and whisked away.\\n\\n\\n In the tradition of newspaperman and observer, Keith Ellason tried\\n to be as inconspicuous as possible, pressing against a bulkhead, but\\n Captain Branson\\'s eyes sought his several times as Branson listened\\n to final reports from his engineers, record keepers, fuel men,\\n computermen, and all the rest. He grunted his approval or disapproval,\\n made a suggestion here, a restriction there. There was no doubt that\\n Branson was in charge, yet there was a human quality about him that\\n Ellason liked. The captain\\'s was a lean face, well tanned, and his eyes\\n were chunks of blue.\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" Branson said at last, as Ellason knew he would, \"I want\\n to introduce Keith Ellason, whose presence Interstellar has impressed\\n upon us. On loan from Transworld, he will have an observer status.\" He\\n introduced him to the others. All of them seemed friendly; Ellason\\n thought it was a good staff.\\n\\n\\n Branson detained him after the others had gone. \"One thing, Mr.\\n Ellason. To make it easier for you, I suggest you think of this journey\\n strictly from the observer viewpoint. There will be no story for\\n Transworld at the end.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason was startled. While he had considered the possibility, he had\\n not dwelt on it. Now it loomed large in his mind. \"I don\\'t understand,\\n Captain Branson. It seems to me—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me put it differently. Let me say that you will not understand why\\n I say that until the journey ends.\" He smiled. \"Perhaps I shouldn\\'t\\n have mentioned it.\"\\nEllason left the captain\\'s quarters with an odd taste in his mouth. Now\\n why had Branson said that? Why hadn\\'t Rexroad or Phipps said something,\\n if it was important?\\n\\n\\n He made himself comfortable in his seven-foot-by-seven-foot cubicle,\\n which is to say he dropped on his bed, found it more comfortable than\\n he thought it would be, put his arms behind his head, stared at the\\n ceiling. Metal walls, no windows, one floor vent, one ceiling vent,\\n and a solitary ceiling molding tube-light. This would be his home for\\n a year, just as there were homes like it for three thousand others,\\n except that the family rooms would be larger. His quarters were near\\n the front of the spike near the officers\\' quarters.\\n\\n\\n He felt rather than heard the dull rumble. It was a sound he knew would\\n be with him for two years—one year going and one year returning.\\n\\n\\n He looked at his watch, picked up his notebook and made an entry. The\\n ship right now would be slipping ever so slowly away from Earth. He got\\n up. He\\'d have to go forward to the observation dome to see that. Last\\n view of Earth for two years.\\nThe penetration of space by large groups is the coming out from under\\n the traditions of thousands of years, and as these planet-orginated\\n rules fall away, the floundering group seeks a new control, for they\\n are humanity adrift, rudderless, for whom the stars are no longer\\n bearings but nonexistent things, and values are altered if they are not\\n shown the way.\\nThe theft of Carver Janssen\\'s attache case occurred on the thirty-first\\n day out. In Ellason\\'s mind the incident, though insignificant from the\\n standpoint of the ship as a whole, could very well be the cause of\\n dissension later on. His notes covering it were therefore very thorough.\\n\\n\\n Janssen\\'s case contained vegetable and flower seeds—thousands of\\n them, according to the Captain\\'s Bulletin, the ship\\'s daily newsletter\\n which went to all hands and passengers. In the Bulletin the captain\\n appealed to the thief to return the case to Mr. Janssen. He said it\\n was significant that all en route had passed stability tests, and that\\n it was to the ship\\'s discredit that someone with criminal tendencies\\n should have been permitted aboard.\\n\\n\\n Ellason had to smile at that. What did Captain Branson think of those\\n colonists who killed each other on the\\nWeblor I\\n? They had passed\\n stability tests too. This, then, was what happened when you took three\\n thousand strangers and stuck them in a can for a year.\\nWhen Ellason saw Branson about it, the captain said, \"Of course I\\n realize it takes only a little thing like this to set things off. I\\n know people get tired of seeing each other, playing the same tapes,\\n looking at the stars from the observation dome, walking down the same\\n corridors, reading the same books, eating the same meals, though God\\n knows we try to vary it as much as we can. Space creates rough edges.\\n But the point is, we know all this, and knowing it, we shouldn\\'t let it\\n happen. We\\'ve got to find that thief.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would he want seeds for? Have you thought of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. They\\'d have real value on Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason sought out Carver Janssen. He was a middle-aged man with a\\n tired face and sad eyes. He said, \"Now what am I going to Antheon\\n for? I could only take along so much baggage and I threw out some\\n comfort items to make room for the seeds. I\\'m a horticulturist, and\\n Interstellar asked me to go along. But what use am I now? Where am\\n I going to get seeds like those? Do you know how long it took me to\\n collect them? They\\'re not ordinary seeds, Mr. Ellason.\"\\n\\n\\n There was an appeal from Janssen in the next day\\'s newsletter\\n describing the seeds, telling of their value, and requesting their\\n return in the interests of the Antheon colony and of humanity.\\n\\n\\n On the thirty-fourth day a witness turned up who said he had seen a\\n man emerging from Janssen\\'s compartment with the black case. \"I didn\\'t\\n think anything of it at the time,\" Jamieson Dievers said.\\n\\n\\n Branson asked him to describe the man.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, he was about six feet tall, stocky build, and he wore a red rubber\\n mask that covered his head completely.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t you think that was important?\" Branson asked in an outraged\\n voice. \"A man wearing a red mask?\"\\n\\n\\n Dievers shrugged. \"This is a spaceship. How would I know whether a red\\n mask—or a blue or green one—does or doesn\\'t belong on a spaceship?\"\\n\\n\\n Although Dievers\\' account appeared in the newsletter, it was largely\\n discounted.\\n\\n\\n \"If it is true,\" Branson told Ellason, \"the theft must be the work of\\n a psychotic. But I don\\'t believe Jamieson Dievers. It may well be he\\'s\\n the psychotic.\" He snorted. \"Red rubber mask! I think I\\'ll have Dievers\\n put through psychiatry.\"\\n\\n\\n Attendant to taking notes on this incident, Ellason noted a strange\\n thing. Janssen lived in that part of the ship known as the First\\n Quadrant, and those who lived in that quadrant—more than seven hundred\\n men, women and children—felt that the thief must surely live in\\n Quadrant Two or Four. Elias Cromley, who had the compartment next to\\n Janssen\\'s, sounded the consensus when he said, \"Surely a man wouldn\\'t\\n steal from his own quadrant, now would he, Mr. Ellason?\"\\n\\n\\n And so, Ellason observed in his notebook, are wars created.\\nSeen in space, stars are unmoving, silent, sterile bright eyes ever\\n watchful and accusing. To men unused to it, such a sight numbs,\\n compresses, stultifies. He introduces a countermeasure, proof he\\n exists, which is any overt act, sometimes violent.\\nOn the forty-fifth day June Failright, the young wife of one of the\\n passenger meteorologists, ran screaming down one of the long corridors\\n of the Third Quadrant. She told the captain she had been attacked in\\n her compartment while her husband was in the ship\\'s library. She was\\n taken to one of the ship\\'s doctors, who confirmed it.\\n\\n\\n She said the culprit was a husky man wearing a red rubber mask, and\\n though her description of what he had done did not appear in the story\\n in the newsletter, it lost no time in penetrating every compartment of\\n the ship.\\n\\n\\n Ellason was present when a delegation from the Third Quadrant called on\\n Captain Branson, demanding action.\\n\\n\\n Branson remained seated behind his desk, unperturbed, saying, \"I have\\n no crewmen to spare for police duty.\"\\n\\n\\n The delegation commenced speaking vehemently, to be quieted by\\n Branson\\'s raised hand.\\n\\n\\n \"I sympathize,\" Branson said, \"but it is up to each quadrant to deal\\n with its problems, whatever they may be. My job is to get us to\\n Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n The group left in a surly mood.\\n\\n\\n \"You wonder at my reluctance, Mr. Ellason,\" Captain Branson said. \"But\\n suppose I assign the crew to patrol duties, the culprit isn\\'t caught,\\n and further incidents occur. What then? It soon becomes the crew\\'s\\n fault. And soon the colonists will begin thinking these things might be\\n the crew\\'s doing in the first place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Ellason said, \"but what if the intruder is a crewman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know my men,\" Branson said flatly.\\n\\n\\n \"You could have a shake-down for the mask and the seed case.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you think it is a member of the crew?\" Branson\\'s eyes were bright.\\n \"No, I trust my men. I won\\'t violate that trust.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason left, feeling uneasy. If he were Branson, he\\'d initiate an\\n investigation, if nothing else than to prove the crew guiltless. Why\\n couldn\\'t Branson see the wisdom of setting an example for the colonists?\\nAs a Nilly, I knew that space breeds hate. There is a seed of\\n malevolence in every man. It sometimes blossoms out among the stars. On\\n the\\nWeblor II\\nit was ready for ripening.\\nRaymond Palugger was killed in the ship\\'s hospital on the sixty-first\\n day. Palugger, a Fourth Quadrant passenger, had complained of feeling\\n ill, had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of ileus. He had put his\\n money belt in the drawer of the small stand beside his bed. A man\\n in a red mask was seen hurrying from the hospital area, and a staff\\n investigation revealed that Palugger had died trying to prevent the\\n theft of the belt.\\n\\n\\n Captain Branson did not wait for the newsletter. Through the ship\\'s\\n speaker system, he reported that Palugger had a fortune in credits\\n in the belt and had died of a severe beating. He said that since the\\n incident occurred in the staff section of the ship, his crew would be\\n forced to submit to a thorough inspection in an effort to find the\\n mask, the seed case, the money and the man.\\n\\n\\n \"I will not countenance such an act by a crewman,\" Branson said. \"If\\n and when he is found, he will be severely dealt with. But he might not\\n be a member of the crew. I am ordering an assembly of all passengers at\\n nine tomorrow morning in the auditorium. I will speak to you all then.\"\\nFaces were angry, tongues were sharp at the meeting, eyes suspicious\\n and tempers short. Above it all was the overpowering presence of\\n Captain Branson speaking to them.\\n\\n\\n \"It is not my desire to interfere in passenger affairs,\" he said.\\n \"Insofar as the ship is concerned, it is my duty to make certain no\\n crewman is guilty. This I am doing. But my crew is not and cannot be\\n a police force for you. It is up to you people to police and protect\\n yourselves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How can we protect ourselves without stunners?\" one colonist called\\n out.\\n\\n\\n \"Has Red Mask a gun?\" Branson retorted. \"It seems to me you have a\\n better weapon than any gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This ship is only so wide, so long and so deep. If every inch is\\n searched, you\\'ll find your man. He has to be somewhere aboard.\"\\n\\n\\n The colonists quieted. Benjamin Simpson, one of the older men, was\\n elected president of the newly formed Quadrant Council. One man from\\n each of the quadrants was named to serve under him. Each of these men\\n in turn selected five others from his own group.\\n\\n\\n Those assembled waited in the hall while each team of six inspected\\n the compartments of the others. These compartments were then locked,\\n everyone returned to his compartment, and the larger search was\\n conducted. It took twenty hours.\\n\\n\\n No mask was found. No mask, no case, no money, no man.\\n\\n\\n The captain reported that his search had been equally fruitless.\\n At another assembly the following day it was decided to make the\\n inspection teams permanent, to await further moves on the part of Red\\n Mask. The Quadrant Council held periodic meetings to set up a method of\\n trial for him when he was caught. It was all recorded in the newsletter\\n and by Keith Ellason.\\nWe Nillys know about hate and about violence. We know too that where\\n there is hate there is violence, and where there is violence there is\\n death.\\nDuring sleep time on the seventy-ninth day Barbara Stoneman, awakened\\n by a strange sound, sat up in the bed of her compartment to find a\\n man in a red mask in her room. Her cries brought neighbors into the\\n corridor. The flight of the man was witnessed by many, and several men\\n tried to stop him. But the intruder was light on his feet and fast. He\\n escaped.\\n\\n\\n The Quadrant Council confronted the captain, demanding weapons.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you out of your minds?\" Branson exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n Tom Tilbury, Fourth Quadrant leader, said, \"We want to set up a police\\n force, Captain. We want stunners.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s no law against it,\" Branson said, \"but it\\'s a rule of mine\\n that no weapons are to be issued en route.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If we had had a gun, we\\'d have got Red Mask,\" Tilbury said.\\n\\n\\n \"And I might have a murder on my conscience.\"\\n\\n\\n Tilbury said, \"We\\'ve also thought of that. Suppose you supply us with\\n half-power stunners? That way we can stun but not kill.\"\\n\\n\\n They got their guns. Now there were twenty-four policemen on duty in\\n the corridors—eight on at a time. Ellason observed that for the first\\n time the passengers seemed relaxed.\\n\\n\\n Let Red Mask move against armed men, they said.\\n\\n\\n Yeah, let him see what happens now.\\n\\n\\n Red Mask did.\\nOn the 101st day he was seen in a corridor in Quadrant Four. Emil\\n Pierce, policeman on duty, managed to squeeze off several shots at his\\n retreating figure.\\n\\n\\n Red Mask was seen again on the 120th day, on the 135th day, and the\\n 157th day. He was seen, shot at, but not hit. He was also unable to\\n commit any crime.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ve got him on the run, the colonists said.\\n\\n\\n He\\'s afraid to do anything, now that we\\'ve got police protection, they\\n said smugly.\\n\\n\\n The Quadrant Council congratulated itself. The passengers were proud\\n of themselves. A special congratulatory message from Captain Branson\\n appeared one day in the Bulletin newsletter.\\n\\n\\n The colonists settled down to living out the rest of the voyage until\\n the landing on Antheon.\\n\\n\\n But on the 170th day calamity struck. Red Mask appropriated one of the\\n stunners, made his way down one whole corridor section in Quadrant Two,\\n put occupants to sleep as he went, taking many articles of value and\\n leaving disorder behind.\\n\\n\\n Ellason interviewed as many victims as he could, noted it all in\\n his book. The things taken were keepsakes, photographs and items of\\n personal value. It seemed to be the work of a madman. If Red Mask\\n wanted to make everyone furious, he certainly succeeded.\\n\\n\\n \"What does he want that stuff for?\" Casey Stromberg, a passenger\\n doctor, asked. \"I can see him taking my narcotics, my doctor\\'s kit—but\\n my dead wife\\'s picture? That I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\\n It was the same with others. \"The man\\'s insane, Mr. Ellason. Positively\\n insane.\" Many people said it.\\n\\n\\n The council issued orders that all passengers from now on would be\\n required to lock their compartments at all times. More guns were\\n obtained from the captain. More policemen were appointed.\\n\\n\\n Ellason was busy noting it all in his book. It became filled with\\n jottings about innocent people being accidentally stunned when\\n trigger-happy policemen thought their movements suspicious, about one\\n man\\'s suspicion of another and the ensuing search of compartments,\\n people who saw Red Mask here, saw him there. Hardly a day went by\\n without some new development.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, Mr. Ellason, we\\'re going to get him,\" said Tilbury, now chief\\n of police, cracking his knuckles, his eyes glowing at the thought.\\n \"We\\'re bound to get him. We\\'ve got things worked out to the finest\\n detail. He won\\'t be able to get through our fingers now. Just let him\\n make so much as a move.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And what will you do when you get him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kill him,\" Tilbury said, licking his lips, his eyes glowing more\\n fiercely than ever.\\n\\n\\n \"Without a trial?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, there\\'ll be a trial, Mr. Ellason, but you don\\'t think any jury\\'d\\n let him live after all the things he\\'s done, do you?\"\\nRed Mask was stunned in Quadrant Four in a corridor by a policeman\\n named Terryl Placer on the 201st day. The criminal was carried to the\\n assembly room surrounded by guards, for he surely would have been\\n mauled, if not killed, by angry colonists who crowded around. In the\\n assembly hall his mask was whipped off. The crowd gasped. Nobody knew\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Ellason\\'s first thought was that he must be a stowaway, but then he\\n remembered the face, and Captain Branson, who came to have a look at\\n him, unhappily admitted the man was a member of the crew. His name was\\n Harrel Critten and he was a record keeper third class.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Critten,\" Branson roared at him, \"what have you got to say for\\n yourself?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go to hell,\" Critten said quietly. As if it were an afterthought, he\\n spat at the captain.\\n\\n\\n Branson looked as if he were going to kill the man himself right there\\n and then.\\n\\n\\n It was a long trial—from the 220th to the 241st day—and there didn\\'t\\n seem to be much doubt about the outcome, for Critten didn\\'t help his\\n own cause during any of it.\\n\\n\\n Lemuel Tarper, who was appointed prosecutor, asked him, \"What did you\\n do with the loot, Critten?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten looked him square in the eye and said, \"I threw it out one of\\n the escape chutes. Does that answer your question?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Threw it away?\" Tarper and the crowd were incredulous.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Critten said. \"You colonists got the easy life as passengers,\\n just sitting around. I had to work my head off keeping records for you\\n lazy bastards.\"\\n\\n\\n The verdict was, of course, death.\\n\\n\\n They executed Harrel Critten on the morning of the 270th day with\\n blasts from six stunners supplied with full power. It was witnessed\\n by a great crowd in the assembly hall. A detail from the ship\\'s crew\\n disposed of his body through a chute.\\n\\n\\n It was all duly recorded in Keith Ellason\\'s notebooks.\\nDying is easy for a Nilly. Especially if it\\'s arranged for beforehand,\\n which it always is.\\nThe\\nWeblor II\\nwas only one day out of orbit when Captain Branson sent\\n for Ellason and introduced him to the executed man.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello,\" Critten said, grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\\n \"I figured as much,\" Ellason said. \"I\\'ve been doing a lot of thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re perhaps a little too good as an observer,\" Branson said. \"Or\\n maybe it was because you really weren\\'t one of the colonists. But no\\n matter, Critten did a good job. He was trained by an old friend of mine\\n for this job, Gelthorpe Nill. Nill used to be in counter-espionage when\\n there were wars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were excellent,\" Ellason said.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t say I enjoyed the role,\" said Critten, \"but I think it saved\\n lives.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me get this straight. Interstellar thought that it was idleness\\n and boredom that caused the killings on the\\nWeblor I\\n, so they had you\\n trained to be a scapegoat. Is that right?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten nodded. \"When great numbers are being transported, they are apt\\n to magnify each little event because so little happens. It was my job\\n to see that they directed none of their venom against each other or the\\n crew, only toward me.\"\\n\\n\\n Branson smiled. \"It made the time pass quickly and interestingly for\\n the passengers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To say nothing of me,\" Critten said.\\n\\n\\n \"And you, Mr. Ellason, were along to observe it all,\" Captain Branson\\n put in. \"Interstellar wanted an accurate picture of this. If it worked,\\n they told me they\\'d use it on other trips to Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason nodded. \"No time for brooding, for differences of opinion on\\n small matters. Just time to hate Mr. Critten. Unanimously.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Probably,\" Critten said, \"you are wondering about the execution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We removed the charges before the guns were used.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Carver Janssen\\'s case?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll get it back when he\\'s shuttled to Antheon. And all the other\\n items will be returned. They\\'re all tagged with their owner\\'s names.\\n Captain Branson will say they were found somewhere on the ship. You\\n see, I was a liar.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about that assault on June Failright?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten grinned again. \"She played right into our hands. She ran out\\n into the hall claiming I\\'d attacked her, which I did not. She was\\n certainly amazed when the ship\\'s physicians agreed with her. Of course\\n Captain Branson told them to do that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the murder?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Raymond Palugger died in the hospital all right, but he died from\\n his illness on the operating table. We turned it into an advantage by\\n making it look suspicious.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason brightened. \"And by that time everybody was seeing Red Mask\\n everywhere and the colonists organized against him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gave them something to do,\" Branson said.\\n\\n\\n \"Every time things got dull, I livened them up. I got a stunner and\\n robbed along the corridor. That really stirred them. Lucky nobody got\\n hurt during any of it, including that Stoneman woman. I was trying to\\n rob her when she woke up.\"\\nBranson cleared his throat. \"Ah, Ellason about that story.

SHEA\\nFor every weapon there was a defense, but not against\\n the deadliest weapon—man himself!\\nRaging\\n , Trooper Lane\\n hovered three thousand\\n feet above Tammany Square.\\n\\n\\n The cool cybrain surgically\\n implanted in him was working\\n on the problem. But Lane\\n had no more patience. They\\'d\\n sweat, he thought, hating the\\n chill air-currents that threw\\n his hovering body this way\\n and that. He glared down at\\n the three towers bordering on\\n the Square. He spat, and\\n watched the little white speck\\n fall, fall.\\nLock me up in barracks.\\n All I wanted was a\\n little time off. Did I fight in\\n Chi for them? Damn right I\\n did. Just a little time off, so\\n I shouldn\\'t blow my top. Now\\n the lid\\'s gone.\\nHe was going over all their\\n heads. He\\'d bowled those city\\n cops over like paper dolls,\\n back at the Armory. The\\n black dog was on Lane\\'s back.\\n Old Mayor himself was going\\n to hear about it.\\nWhy not? Ain\\'t old Mayor\\n the CinC of the Newyork\\n Troopers?\\nThe humming paragrav-paks\\n embedded beneath his\\n shoulder blades held him\\n motionless above Newyork\\'s\\n three administrative towers.\\n Tammany Hall. Mayor\\'s Palace.\\n Court House. Lane cursed\\n his stupidity. He hadn\\'t found\\n out which one was which\\n ahead of time.\\nThey keep\\n Troopers in the Armory and\\n teach them how to fight. They\\n don\\'t teach them about their\\n own city, that they\\'ll be fighting\\n for. There\\'s no time. From\\n seven years old up, Troopers\\n have too much to learn about\\n fighting.\\nThe Mayor was behind one\\n of those thousands of windows.\\n\\n\\n Old cybrain, a gift from the\\n Trooper surgeons, compliments\\n of the city, would have\\n to figure out which one. Blood\\n churned in his veins, nerves\\n shrieked with impatience.\\n Lane waited for the electronic\\n brain to come up with the answer.\\n\\n\\n Then his head jerked up, to\\n a distant buzz. There were\\n cops coming. Two black paragrav-boats\\n whirred along the\\n translucent underside of Newyork\\'s\\n anti-missile force-shield,\\n the Shell.\\nOld cybrain better be fast.\\n Damn fast!\\nThe cybrain jolted an impulse\\n through his spine. Lane\\n somersaulted. Cybrain had\\n taken charge of his motor\\n nerves. Lane\\'s own mind was\\n just along for the ride.\\nHis\\n body snapped into a\\n stiff dive position. He began\\n to plummet down, picking\\n up speed. His mailed hands\\n glittered like arrowheads out\\n in front. They pointed to a\\n particular window in one of\\n the towers. A predatory excitement\\n rippled through him\\n as he sailed down through the\\n air. It was like going into\\n battle again. A little red-white-and-green\\n flag fluttered\\n on a staff below the window.\\n Whose flag? The city flag was\\n orange and blue. He shrugged\\n away the problem. Cybrain\\n knew what it was doing.\\n\\n\\n The little finger of his right\\n hand vibrated in its metal\\n sheath. A pale vibray leaped\\n from the lensed fingertip.\\n Breakthrough! The glasstic\\n pane dissolved. Lane streamed\\n through the window.\\n\\n\\n The paragrav-paks cut off.\\n Lane dropped lightly to the\\n floor, inside the room, in battle-crouch.\\n A 3V set was yammering.\\n A girl screamed. Lane\\'s\\n hand shot out automatically.\\n A finger vibrated. Out of the\\n corner of his eye, Lane saw\\n the girl fold to the floor. There\\n was no one else in the room.\\n Lane, still in a crouch, chewed\\n his lip.\\nThe Mayor?\\nHis head swung around and\\n he peered at the 3V set. He\\n saw his own face.\\n\\n\\n \"Lashing police with his\\n vibray,\" said the announcer,\\n \"Lane broke through the cordon\\n surrounding Manhattan\\n Armory. Two policemen were\\n killed, four others seriously\\n injured. Tammany Hall has\\n warned that this man is extremely\\n dangerous. Citizens\\n are cautioned to keep clear of\\n him. Lane is an insane killer.\\n He is armed with the latest\\n military weapons. A built-in\\n electronic brain controls his\\n reflexes—\"\\n\\n\\n \"At ease with that jazz,\"\\n said Lane, and a sheathed finger\\n snapped out. There was a\\n loud bang. The 3V screen dissolved\\n into a puddle of glasstic.\\nThe Mayor.\\nLane strode to the window.\\n The two police boats were\\n hovering above the towers.\\n Lane\\'s mailed hand snapped\\n open a pouch at his belt. He\\n flipped a fist-sized cube to the\\n floor.\\n\\n\\n The force-bomb \"exploded\"—swelled\\n or inflated, really,\\n but with the speed of a blast.\\n Lane glanced out the window.\\n A section of the energy globe\\n bellied out from above. It\\n shaded the view from his window\\n and re-entered the tower\\n wall just below.\\n\\n\\n Now the girl.\\n\\n\\n He turned back to the room.\\n \"Wake up, outa-towner.\" He\\n gave the blonde girl a light\\n dose of the vibray to slap her\\n awake.\\n\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" she said,\\n shakily.\\n\\n\\n Lane grinned. \"Trooper\\n Lane, of the Newyork Special\\n Troops, is all.\" He threw her\\n a mock salute. \"You from\\n outa-town, girlie. I ain\\'t seen\\n a Newyork girl with yellow\\n hair in years. Orange or\\n green is the action. Whatcha\\n doing in the Mayor\\'s room?\"\\nThe\\n girl pushed herself to\\n her feet. Built, Lane saw.\\n She was pretty and clean-looking,\\n very out-of-town. She\\n held herself straight and her\\n blue-violet eyes snapped at\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"What the devil do you\\n think you\\'re doing, soldier? I\\n am a diplomat of the Grassroots\\n Republic of Mars. This\\n is an embassy, if you know\\n what that means.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t,\" said Lane, unconcerned.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, you should have had\\n brains enough to honor the\\n flag outside this window.\\n That\\'s the Martian flag, soldier.\\n If you\\'ve never heard of\\n diplomatic immunity, you\\'ll\\n suffer for your ignorance.\"\\n Her large, dark eyes narrowed.\\n \"Who sent you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"My cybrain sent me.\"\\n\\n\\n She went openmouthed.\\n \"You\\'re\\nLane\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m the guy they told you\\n about on the 3V. Where\\'s the\\n Mayor? Ain\\'t this his place?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No. No, you\\'re in the\\n wrong room. The wrong building.\\n That\\'s the Mayor\\'s suite\\n over there.\" She pointed. \"See\\n where the balcony is? This is\\n the Embassy suite. If you\\n want the Mayor you\\'ll have to\\n go over there.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Whaddaya know,\" said\\n Lane. \"Cybrain didn\\'t know,\\n no more than me.\"\\n\\n\\n The girl noticed the dark\\n swell of the force-globe.\\n \"What\\'s that out there?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Force-screen. Nothing gets\\n past, except maybe a full-size\\n blaster-beam. Keeps cops out.\\n Keeps you in. You anybody\\n important?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I told you, I\\'m an ambassador.\\n From Mars. I\\'m on a\\n diplomatic mission.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah? Mars a big city?\"\\n\\n\\n She stared at him, violet\\n eyes wide. \"The\\nplanet\\nMars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Planet? Oh,\\nthat\\nMars.\\n Sure, I\\'ve heard of it—you\\n gotta go by spaceship. What\\'s\\n your name?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gerri Kin. Look, Lane,\\n holding me is no good.

They got a\\n new Mayor out there in Chi.\\n He takes orders from Newyork.\"\\n\\n\\n Gerri Kin said, \"That\\'s\\n what the force-domes did. The\\n perfect defense. But also the\\n road to the return to city-states.\\n Anarchy.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane said, \"Yeah? Well, we\\n done what they wanted us to\\n do. We did the fighting for\\n them. So we come back home\\n to Newyork and they lock us\\n up in the Armory. Won\\'t pay\\n us. Won\\'t let us go nowhere.\\n They had cops guarding us.\\n City cops.\" Lane sneered. \"I\\n busted out. I wanna see the\\n Mayor and find out why we\\n can\\'t have time off. I don\\'t\\n play games, Gerri. I go right\\n to the top.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane broke off. There was\\n a hum outside the window. He\\n whirled and stared out. The\\n rounded black hulls of the two\\n police paragrav-boats were\\n nosing toward the force-screen.\\n Lane could read the\\n white numbers painted on\\n their bows.\\n\\n\\n A loudspeaker shouted into\\n the room: \"Come out of there,\\n Lane, or we\\'ll blast you out.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You can\\'t,\" Lane called.\\n \"This girl from Mars is here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I repeat, Lane—come out\\n or we\\'ll blast you out.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane turned to the girl. \"I\\n thought you were important.\"\\nShe\\n stood there with her\\n hands together, calmly\\n looking at him. \"I am. But\\n you are too, to them. Mars is\\n millions of miles away, and\\n you\\'re right across the Square\\n from the Mayor\\'s suite.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, but—\" Lane shook\\n his head and turned back to\\n the window. \"All right, look!\\n Move them boats away and\\n I\\'ll let this girl out!\"\\n\\n\\n \"No deal, Lane. We\\'re coming\\n in.\" The police boats\\n backed away slowly, then shot\\n straight up, out of the line of\\n vision.\\n\\n\\n Lane looked down at the\\n Square. Far below, the long,\\n gleaming barrel of a blaster\\n cannon caught the dim light\\n filtering down through Newyork\\'s\\n Shell. The cannon trundled\\n into the Square on its\\n olive-drab, box-shaped caterpillar\\n mounting and took up a\\n position equidistant from the\\n bases of the three towers.\\n\\n\\n Now a rumble of many\\n voices rose from below. Lane\\n stared down to see a large\\n crowd gathering in Tammany\\n Square. Sound trucks were\\n rolling to a stop around the\\n edges of the crowd. The people\\n were all looking up.\\n\\n\\n Lane looked across the\\n Square. The windows of the\\n tower opposite, the ones he\\n could see clearly, were crowded\\n with faces. There were\\n white dot faces on the balcony\\n that Gerri Kin had pointed\\n out as the Mayor\\'s suite.\\n\\n\\n The voice of a 3V newscaster\\n rolled up from the Square,\\n reechoing against the tower\\n walls.\\n\\n\\n \"Lane is holding the Martian\\n Ambassador, Gerri Kin,\\n hostage. You can see the Martian\\n tricolor behind his force-globe.\\n Police are bringing up\\n blaster cannon. Lane\\'s defense\\n is a globe of energy\\n similar to the one which protects\\n Newyork from aerial attack.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane grinned back at Gerri\\n Kin. \"Whole town\\'s down\\n there.\" Then his grin faded.\\n Nice-looking, nice-talking girl\\n like this probably cared a lot\\n more about dying than he did.\\n Why the hell didn\\'t they give\\n him a chance to let her out?\\n Maybe he could do it now.\\n\\n\\n Cybrain said no. It said the\\n second he dropped his force-screen,\\n they\\'d blast this room\\n to hell. Poor girl from Mars,\\n she didn\\'t have a chance.\\n\\n\\n Gerri Kin put her hand to\\n her forehead. \"Why did you\\n have to pick my room? Why\\n did they send me to this crazy\\n city? Private soldiers. Twenty\\n million people living under\\n a Shell like worms in a corpse.\\n Earth is sick and it\\'s going to\\n kill me. What\\'s going to happen?\"\\n\\n\\n Lane looked sadly at her.\\n Only two kinds of girls ever\\n went near a Trooper—the\\n crazy ones and the ones the\\n city paid. Why did he have to\\n be so near getting killed when\\n he met one he liked? Now that\\n she was showing a little less\\n fear and anger, she was talking\\n straight to him. She was\\n good, but she wasn\\'t acting as\\n if she was too good for him.\\n\\n\\n \"They\\'ll start shooting pretty\\n quick,\" said Lane. \"I\\'m\\n sorry about you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish I could write a letter\\n to my parents,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t you understand\\n what I said?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s a letter?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You don\\'t know where\\n Mars is. You don\\'t know what\\n a letter is. You probably can\\'t\\n even read and write!\"\\nLane\\n shrugged. He carried\\n on the conversation disinterestedly,\\n professionally relaxed\\n before battle. \"What\\'s\\n these things I can\\'t do? They\\n important?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. The more I see of this\\n city and its people, the more\\n important I realize they are.\\n You know how to fight, don\\'t\\n you? I\\'ll bet you\\'re perfect\\n with those weapons.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Listen. They been training\\n me to fight since I was a little\\n kid. Why shouldn\\'t I be a\\n great little fighter?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Specialization,\" said the\\n girl from Mars.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Specialization. Everyone\\n I\\'ve met in this city is a specialist.\\n SocioSpecs run the\\n government. TechnoSpecs run\\n the machinery. Troopers fight\\n the wars. And ninety per cent\\n of the people don\\'t work at all\\n because they\\'re not trained to\\n do anything.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The Fans,\" said Lane.\\n \"They got it soft. That\\'s them\\n down there, come to watch the\\n fight.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know why you were\\n kept in the Armory, Lane? I\\n heard them talking about it,\\n at the dinner I went to last\\n night.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because they\\'re afraid of\\n the Troopers. You men did too\\n good a job out in Chi. You are\\n the deadliest weapon that has\\n ever been made. You. Single\\n airborne infantrymen!\"\\n\\n\\n Lane said, \"They told us in\\n Trooper Academy that it\\'s the\\n men that win the wars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, but people had forgotten\\n it until the SocioSpecs of\\n Newyork came up with the\\n Troopers. Before the Troopers,\\n governments concentrated\\n on the big weapons, the\\n missiles, the bombs. And the\\n cities, with the Shells, were\\n safe from bombs. They learned\\n to be self-sufficient under\\n the Shells. They were so safe,\\n so isolated, that national governments\\n collapsed. But you\\n Troopers wiped out that feeling\\n of security, when you infiltrated\\n Chi and conquered\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We scared them, huh?\"\\n\\n\\n Gerri said, \"You scared\\n them so much that they were\\n afraid to let you have a furlough\\n in the city when you\\n came back. Afraid you Troopers\\n would realize that you\\n could easily take over the city\\n if you wanted to. You scared\\n them so much that they\\'ll let\\n me be killed. They\\'ll actually\\n risk trouble with Mars just to\\n kill you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry about you. I\\n mean it, I like—\"\\n\\n\\n At that moment a titanic,\\n ear-splitting explosion hurled\\n him to the carpet, deafened\\n and blinded him.\\n\\n\\n He recovered and saw Gerri\\n a few feet away, dazed, groping\\n on hands and knees.\\n\\n\\n Lane jumped to the window,\\n looked quickly, sprang\\n back. Cybrain pumped orders\\n to his nervous system.\\n\\n\\n \"Blaster cannon,\" he said.\\n \"But just one. Gotcha, cybrain.\\n I can beat that.\"\\n\\n\\n He picked up the black box\\n that generated his protective\\n screen. Snapping it open with\\n thumb-pressure, he turned a\\n small dial. Then he waited.\\n\\n\\n Again an enormous, brain-shattering\\n concussion.\\n\\n\\n Again Lane and Gerri were\\n thrown to the floor. But this\\n time there was a second explosion\\n and a blinding flash\\n from below.\\n\\n\\n Lane laughed boyishly and\\n ran to the window.\\n\\n\\n \"Look!\" he called to Gerri.\\nThere\\n was a huge gap in\\n the crowd below. The\\n pavement was blackened and\\n shattered to rubble. In and\\n around the open space\\n sprawled dozens of tiny black\\n figures, not moving.\\n\\n\\n \"Backfire,\" said Lane. \"I set\\n the screen to throw their\\n blaster beam right back at\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And they knew you might—and\\n yet they let a crowd\\n congregate!\"\\n\\n\\n Gerri reeled away from the\\n window, sick.\\n\\n\\n Lane said, \"I can do that a\\n couple times more, but it\\n burns out the force-globe.\\n Then I\\'m dead.\"\\n\\n\\n He heard the 3V newscaster\\'s\\n amplified voice: \"—approximately\\n fifty killed. But\\n Lane is through now. He has\\n been able to outthink police\\n with the help of his cybrain.\\n Now police are feeding the\\n problem to their giant analogue\\n computer in the sub-basement\\n of the Court House.\\n The police analogue computer\\n will be able to outthink Lane\\'s\\n cybrain, will predict Lane\\'s\\n moves in advance. Four more\\n blaster cannon are coming\\n down Broadway—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t they clear those\\n people out of the Square?\"\\n Gerri cried.\\n\\n\\n \"What? Oh, the Fans—nobody\\n clears them out.\" He\\n paused. \"I got one more\\n chance to try.\" He raised a\\n mailed glove to his mouth and\\n pressed a small stud in the\\n wrist. He said, \"Trooper HQ,\\n this is Lane.\"\\n\\n\\n A voice spoke in his helmet.\\n \"Lane, this is Trooper\\n HQ. We figured you\\'d call.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Get me Colonel Klett.\"\\n\\n\\n Thirty seconds passed. Lane\\n could hear the clank of caterpillar\\n treads as the mobile\\n blaster cannon rolled into\\n Tammany Square.\\n\\n\\n The voice of the commanding\\n officer of the Troopers\\n rasped into Lane\\'s ear:\\n \"Meat-head! You broke out\\n against my orders!\\nNow\\nlook\\n at you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I knew you didn\\'t mean\\n them orders, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If you get out of there\\n alive, I\\'ll hang you for disobeying\\n them!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Sir, there\\'s a girl\\n here—somebody important—from\\n Mars. You know, the\\n planet. Sir, she told me we\\n could take over the city if we\\n got loose. That right, sir?\"\\n\\n\\n There was a pause. \"Your\\n girl from Mars is right, Lane.\\n But it\\'s too late now. If we\\n had moved first, captured the\\n city government, we might\\n have done it. But they\\'re\\n ready for us. They\\'d chop us\\n down with blaster cannon.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sir, I\\'m asking for help. I\\n know you\\'re on my side.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am, Lane.\" The voice of\\n Colonel Klett was lower. \"I\\'d\\n never admit it if you had a\\n chance of getting out of there\\n alive. You\\'ve had it, son. I\\'d\\n only lose more men trying to\\n rescue you. When they feed\\n the data into that analogue\\n computer, you\\'re finished.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry, Lane.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Over and out.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane pressed the stud on\\n his gauntlet again. He turned\\n to Gerri.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re okay. I wish I\\n could let you out. Old cybrain\\n says I can\\'t. Says if I drop the\\n force-globe for a second,\\n they\\'ll fire into the room, and\\n then we\\'ll both be dead.\"\\nGerri\\n stood with folded\\n arms and looked at him.\\n \"Do what you have to do. As\\n far as I can see, you\\'re the\\n only person in this city that\\n has even a little bit of right\\n on his side.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane laughed. \"Any of them\\n purple-haired broads I know\\n would be crazy scared. You\\'re\\n different.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When my grandparents\\n landed on Mars, they found\\n out that selfishness was a luxury.\\n Martians can\\'t afford\\n it.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane frowned with the effort\\n of thinking. \"You said I\\n had a little right on my side.\\n That\\'s a good feeling. Nobody\\n ever told me to feel that way\\n about myself before. It\\'ll be\\n better to die knowing that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n The amplified voice from\\n below said, \"The police analogue\\n computer is now hooked\\n directly to the controls of the\\n blaster cannon battery. It will\\n outguess Lane\\'s cybrain and\\n check his moves ahead of\\n time.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane looked at Gerri. \"How\\n about giving me a kiss before\\n they get us? Be nice if I kissed\\n a girl like you just once in\\n my life.\"\\n\\n\\n She smiled and walked forward.\\n \"You deserve it, Lane.\"\\n\\n\\n He kissed her and it filled\\n him with longings for things\\n he couldn\\'t name. Then he\\n stepped back and shook his\\n head. \"It ain\\'t right you\\n should get killed. If I take a\\n dive out that window, they\\n shoot at me, not in here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And kill you all the sooner.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Better than getting burned\\n up in this lousy little room.\\n You also got right on your\\n side. There\\'s too many damn\\n Troopers and not enough good\\n persons like you. Old cybrain\\n says stay here, but I don\\'t\\n guess I will. I\\'m gonna pay\\n you back for that kiss.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But you\\'re safe in here!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Worry about yourself, not\\n about me.\" Lane picked up the\\n force-bomb and handed it to\\n her. \"When I say now, press\\n this. Then take your hand off,\\n real fast. It\\'ll shut off the\\n screen for a second.\"\\n\\n\\n He stepped up on to the\\n window ledge. Automatically,\\n the cybrain cut in his paragrav-paks.\\n \"So long, outa-towner.\\nNow!\\n\"\\n\\n\\n He jumped. He was hurtling\\n across the Square when the\\n blaster cannons opened up.\\n They weren\\'t aimed at the\\n window where the little red-white-and-green\\n tricolor was\\n flying. But they weren\\'t aimed\\n at Lane, either. They were\\n shooting wild.\\nWhich way now? Looks\\n like I got a chance. Old cybrain\\n says fly right for the\\n cannons.\\nHe saw the Mayor\\'s balcony\\n ahead.\\nGo to hell, old cybrain.\\n I\\'m doing all right by myself.\\n I come to see the Mayor, and\\n I\\'m gonna see him.\\nLane plunged forward. He\\n heard the shouts of frightened\\n men.\\n\\n\\n He swooped over the balcony\\n railing. A man was\\n pointing a blaster pistol at\\n him. There were five men\\n on the balcony—emergency!\\n Years of training and cybrain\\n took over. Lane\\'s hand shot\\n out, fingers vibrating. As he\\n dropped to the balcony floor in\\n battle-crouch, the men slumped\\n around him.\\n\\n\\n He had seen the man with\\n the blaster pistol before. It\\n was the Mayor of Newyork.\\n\\n\\n Lane stood for a moment in\\n the midst of the sprawled\\n men, the shrieks of the crowd\\n floating up to him. Then he\\n raised his glove to his lips. He\\n made contact with Manhattan\\n Armory.\\n\\n\\n \"Colonel Klett, sir. You\\n said if we captured the city\\n government we might have a\\n chance. Well, I captured the\\n city government. What do we\\n do with it now?\"\\nLane\\n was uncomfortable in\\n his dress uniform. First\\n there had been a ceremony in\\n Tammany Square inaugurating\\n Newyork\\'s new Military\\n Protectorate, and honoring\\n Trooper Lane. Now there was\\n a formal dinner. Colonel Klett\\n and Gerri Kin sat on either\\n side of Lane.\\n\\n\\n Klett said, \"Call me an opportunist\\n if you like, Miss\\n Kin, my government will be\\n stable, and Mars can negotiate\\n with it.\" He was a lean, sharp-featured\\n man with deep\\n grooves in his face, and gray\\n hair.\\n\\n\\n Gerri shook her head. \"Recognition\\n for a new government\\n takes time. I\\'m going\\n back to Mars, and I think\\n they\\'ll send another ambassador\\n next time. Nothing personal—I\\n just don\\'t like it\\n here.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane said, \"I\\'m going to\\n Mars, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Did she ask you to?\" demanded\\n Klett.\\n\\n\\n Lane shook his head. \"She\\'s\\n got too much class for me. But\\n I like what she told me about\\n Mars. It\\'s healthy, like.\"\\n\\n\\n Klett frowned. \"If I thought\\n there was a gram of talent involved\\n in your capture of the\\n Mayor, Lane, I\\'d never release\\n you from duty. But I\\n know better. You beat that\\n analogue computer by sheer\\n stupidity—by disregarding\\n your cybrain.\"\\n\\n\\n Lane said, \"It wasn\\'t so stupid\\n if it worked.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s what bothers me. It\\n calls for a revision in our tactics.\\n We\\'ve got a way of beating\\n those big computers now,\\n should anyone use them\\n against us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I just didn\\'t want her to\\n be hurt.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly. The computer\\n could outguess a machine, like\\n your cybrain. But you introduced\\n a totally unpredictable\\n factor—human emotion.\\n Which proves what I, as a\\n military man, have always\\n maintained—that the deadliest\\n weapon in man\\'s arsenal\\n is still, and will always be, the\\n individual soldier.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What you just said there,\\n sir,\" said Lane. \"That\\'s why\\n I\\'m leaving Newyork.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked\\n Colonel Klett.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m tired of being a weapon,\\n sir. I want to be a human\\n being.\"\\nEND\\nWork is the elimination of the traces of work.\\n—Michelangelo\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nIf\\nJuly 1959.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

If he didn\\'t sell\\n much of my stuff, at least he sold\\nme\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'ll be the biggest break a\\n writer ever got,\" he told me, two\\n days before blastoff. \"Oh, sure\\n there\\'ll be scientific reports on the\\n trip, but the public doesn\\'t want\\n them; they want the\\nhuman\\nslant\\n on things.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But, Louie,\" I said weakly, \"I\\'ll\\n probably be locked up for the\\n whole trip. If there are fights or accidents,\\n they won\\'t tell\\nme\\nabout\\n them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nonsense,\" said Louie, sipping\\n carefully at a paper cup of scalding\\n coffee. \"It\\'ll be just like the\\n public going along vicariously.\\n They\\'ll\\nidentify\\nwith you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But, Louie,\" I said, wiping the\\n dampness from my palms on the\\n knees of my trousers as I sat there,\\n \"how\\'ll I go about it? A story? An\\n article? A\\nyou-are-there\\ntype of report?\\n What?\"\\n\\n\\n Louie shrugged. \"So keep a\\n diary. It\\'ll be more intimate, like.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But what if nothing happens?\"\\n I insisted hopelessly.\\n\\n\\n Louie smiled. \"So you fake it.\"\\n\\n\\n I got up from the chair in his office\\n and stepped to the door.\\n \"That\\'s dishonest,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n\\n \"Creative is the word,\" Louie\\n said.\\n\\n\\n So I went on the first trip to\\n Mars. And I kept a diary. This is\\n it. And it is honest. Honest it is.\\nOctober 1, 1960\\nThey picked\\n the launching\\n date from the March, 1959, New\\n York\\nTimes\\n, which stated that this\\n was the most likely time for launching.\\n Trip time is supposed to take\\n 260 days \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthat\\'s one way\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, so\\n we\\'re aimed toward where Mars\\n will be \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mhad\\nbetter\\nbe, or else\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m.\\n\\n\\n There are five of us on board. A\\n pilot, co-pilot, navigator and biochemist.\\n And, of course, me. I\\'ve\\n met all but the pilot \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mhe\\'s very\\n busy today\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, and they seem friendly\\n enough.\\n\\n\\n Dwight Kroger, the biochemist,\\n is rather old to take the \"rigors of\\n the journey,\" as he puts it, but the\\n government had a choice between\\n sending a green scientist who could\\n stand the trip or an accomplished\\n man who would probably not survive,\\n so they picked Kroger. We\\'ve\\n blasted off, though, and he\\'s still\\n with us. He looks a damn sight better\\n than I feel. He\\'s kind of balding,\\n and very iron-gray-haired and\\n skinny, but his skin is tan as an Indian\\'s,\\n and right now he\\'s telling\\n jokes in the washroom with the co-pilot.\\n\\n\\n Jones \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthat\\'s the co-pilot; I\\n didn\\'t quite catch his first name\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m is\\n scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and\\n gives the general appearance of belonging\\n under the spreading chestnut\\n tree, not in a metal bullet flinging\\n itself out into airless space.\\n Come to think of it, who\\ndoes\\nbelong\\n where we are?\\n\\n\\n The navigator\\'s name is Lloyd\\n Streeter, but I haven\\'t seen his face\\n yet. He has a little cubicle behind\\n the pilot\\'s compartment, with all\\n kinds of maps and rulers and things.\\n He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthey call it the bulkhead,\\n for some reason or other\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n table, scratching away with a ballpoint\\n pen on the maps, and now\\n and then calling numbers over a\\n microphone to the pilot. His hair\\n is red and curly, and he looks as\\n though he\\'d be tall if he ever gets\\n to stand up. There are freckles on\\n the backs of his hands, so I think\\n he\\'s probably got them on his face,\\n too. So far, all he\\'s said is, \"Scram,\\n I\\'m busy.\"\\n\\n\\n Kroger tells me that the pilot\\'s\\n name is Patrick Desmond, but that\\n I can call him Pat when I get to\\n know him better. So far, he\\'s still\\n Captain Desmond to me. I haven\\'t\\n the vaguest idea what he looks like.\\n He was already on board when I\\n got here, with my typewriter and\\n ream of paper, so we didn\\'t meet.\\n\\n\\n My compartment is small but\\n clean. I mean clean now. It wasn\\'t\\n during blastoff. The inertial gravities\\n didn\\'t bother me so much as\\n the gyroscopic spin they put on the\\n ship so we have a sort of artificial\\n gravity to hold us against the\\n curved floor. It\\'s that constant\\n whirly feeling that gets me. I get\\n sick on merry-go-rounds, too.\\n\\n\\n They\\'re having pork for dinner\\n today. Not me.\\nOctober 2, 1960\\nFeeling much\\n better today.\\n Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine\\n pills. He says they\\'ll help my\\n stomach. So far, so good.\\n\\n\\n Lloyd came by, also. \"You play\\n chess?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"A little,\" I admitted.\\n\\n\\n \"How about a game sometime?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Do you have a\\n board?\"\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n Lloyd went away then, but the\\n interview wasn\\'t wasted. I learned\\n that he\\nis\\ntall and\\ndoes\\nhave a\\n freckled face. Maybe we can build\\n a chessboard. With my paper and\\n his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should\\n be easy. Don\\'t know what we\\'ll use\\n for pieces, though.\\n\\n\\n Jones \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mI still haven\\'t learned his\\n first name\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m has been up with the\\n pilot all day. He passed my room\\n on the way to the galley \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthe\\n kitchen\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m for a cup of dark brown\\n coffee \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mthey like it thick\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m and told\\n me that we were almost past the\\n Moon. I asked to look, but he said\\n not yet; the instrument panel is\\n Top Secret. They\\'d have to cover\\n it so I could look out the viewing\\n screen, and they still need it for\\n steering or something.\\n\\n\\n I still haven\\'t met the pilot.\\nOctober 3, 1960\\nWell, I\\'ve\\n met the pilot. He is\\n kind of squat, with a vulturish neck\\n and close-set jet-black eyes that\\n make him look rather mean, but he\\n was pleasant enough, and said I\\n could call him Pat. I still don\\'t\\n know Jones\\' first name, though Pat\\n spoke to him, and it sounded like\\n Flants. That can\\'t be right.\\n\\n\\n Also, I am one of the first five\\n men in the history of the world to\\n see the opposite side of the Moon,\\n with a bluish blurred crescent beyond\\n it that Pat said was the Earth.\\n The back of the Moon isn\\'t much\\n different from the front. As to the\\n space in front of the ship, well, it\\'s\\n all black with white dots in it, and\\n none of the dots move, except in a\\n circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"\\n result from the gyroscopic spin\\n we\\'re in. Actually, he explained to\\n me, the screen is supposed to keep\\n the image of space locked into\\n place no matter how much we spin.\\n But there\\'s some kind of a \"drag.\"\\n I told him I hoped it didn\\'t mean\\n we\\'d land on Mars upside down. He\\n just stared at me.\\n\\n\\n I can\\'t say I was too impressed\\n with that 16 x 19 view of outer\\n space. It\\'s been done much better\\n in the movies. There\\'s just no awesomeness\\n to it, no sense of depth or\\n immensity. It\\'s as impressive as a\\n piece of velvet with salt sprinkled\\n on it.\\n\\n\\n Lloyd and I made a chessboard\\n out of a carton. Right now we\\'re using\\n buttons for men. He\\'s one of\\n these fast players who don\\'t stop\\n and think out their moves. And so\\n far I haven\\'t won a game.\\n\\n\\n It looks like a long trip.\\nOctober 4, 1960\\nI won\\n a game. Lloyd mistook my\\n queen-button for my bishop-button\\n and left his king in jeopardy, and\\n I checkmated him next move. He\\n said chess was a waste of time\\n and he had important work to do\\n and he went away.\\n\\n\\n I went to the galley for coffee\\n and had a talk about moss with\\n Kroger. He said there was a good\\n chance of lichen on Mars, and I\\n misunderstood and said, \"A good\\n chance of liking\\nwhat\\non Mars?\"\\n and Kroger finished his coffee and\\n went up front.\\n\\n\\n When I got back to my compartment,\\n Lloyd had taken away the\\n chessboard and all his buttons. He\\n told me later he needed it to back\\n up a star map.\\n\\n\\n Pat slept mostly all day in his\\n compartment, and Jones sat and\\n watched the screen revolve. There\\n wasn\\'t much to do, so I wrote a\\n poem, sort of.\\n\\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,\\n \\nHow does your garden grow?\\n \\nWith Martian rime, Venusian slime,\\n \\nAnd a radioactive hoe.\\n \\n\\n I showed it to Kroger. He says\\n it may prove to be environmentally\\n accurate, but that I should stick to\\n prose.\\nOctober 5, 1960\\nLearned Jones\\'\\n first name.\\n He wrote something in the ship\\'s\\n log, and I saw his signature. His\\n name is Fleance, like in \"Macbeth.\"\\n He prefers to be called Jones. Pat\\n uses his first name as a gag. Some\\n fun.\\n\\n\\n And only 255 days to go.\\nApril 1, 1961\\nI\\'ve skipped\\n over the last 177\\n days or so, because there\\'s nothing\\n much new. I brought some books\\n with me on the trip, books that I\\'d\\n always meant to read and never\\n had the time. So now I know all\\n about\\nVanity Fair\\n,\\nPride and Prejudice\\n,\\nWar and Peace\\n,\\nGone with\\n the Wind\\n, and\\nBabbitt\\n.\\n\\n\\n They didn\\'t take as long as I\\n thought they would, except for\\nVanity Fair\\n. It must have been a\\n riot when it first came out. I mean,\\n all those sly digs at the aristocracy,\\n with copious interpolations by Mr.\\n Thackeray in case you didn\\'t get\\n it when he\\'d pulled a particularly\\n good gag. Some fun.\\n\\n\\n And only 78 days to go.\\nJune 1, 1961\\nOnly 17 days\\n to go. I saw Mars\\n on the screen today. It seems to be\\n descending from overhead, but Pat\\n says that that\\'s the \"torque\" doing\\n it. Actually, it\\'s we who are coming\\n in sideways.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ve all grown beards, too. Pat\\n said it was against regulations, but\\n what the hell. We have a contest.\\n Longest whiskers on landing gets a\\n prize.\\n\\n\\n I asked Pat what the prize was\\n and he told me to go to hell.\\nJune 18, 1961\\nMars has\\n the whole screen\\n filled. Looks like Death Valley. No\\n sign of canals, but Pat says that\\'s\\n because of the dust storm down below.\\n It\\'s nice to have a \"down below\"\\n again. We\\'re going to land, so\\n I have to go to my bunk. It\\'s all\\n foam rubber, nylon braid supports\\n and magnesium tubing. Might as\\n well be cement for all the good it\\n did me at takeoff. Earth seems awfully\\n far away.\\nJune 19, 1961\\nWell, we\\'re down.\\n We have\\n to wear gas masks with oxygen\\n hook-ups. Kroger says the air is\\n breathable, but thin, and it has too\\n much dust in it to be any fun to\\n inhale. He\\'s all for going out and\\n looking for lichen, but Pat says he\\'s\\n got to set up camp, then get instructions\\n from Earth. So we just have\\n to wait. The air is very cold, but the\\n Sun is hot as hell when it hits you.\\n The sky is a blinding pink, or maybe\\n more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger\\n says it\\'s the dust. The sand underfoot\\n is kind of rose-colored, and not\\n really gritty. The particles are\\n round and smooth.\\n\\n\\n No lichen so far. Kroger says\\n maybe in the canals, if there are\\n any canals. Lloyd wants to play\\n chess again.\\n\\n\\n Jones won the beard contest. Pat\\n gave him a cigar he\\'d smuggled on\\n board \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mno smoking was allowed on\\n the ship\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, and Jones threw it away.\\n He doesn\\'t smoke.\\nJune 20, 1961\\nGot lost today.\\n Pat told me\\n not to go too far from camp, so,\\n when I took a stroll, I made sure\\n every so often that I could still see\\n the rocket behind me. Walked for\\n maybe an hour; then the oxygen\\n gauge got past the halfway mark,\\n so I started back toward the rocket.\\n After maybe ten steps, the rocket\\n disappeared. One minute it was\\n standing there, tall and silvery, the\\n next instant it was gone.\\n\\n\\n Turned on my radio pack and\\n got hold of Pat. Told him what happened,\\n and he told Kroger. Kroger\\n said I had been following a mirage,\\n to step back a bit. I did, and I could\\n see the ship again. Kroger said to\\n try and walk toward where the ship\\n seemed to be, even when it wasn\\'t\\n in view, and meantime they\\'d come\\n out after me in the jeep, following\\n my footprints.\\n\\n\\n Started walking back, and the\\n ship vanished again. It reappeared,\\n disappeared, but I kept going. Finally\\n saw the real ship, and Lloyd\\n and Jones waving their arms at me.\\n They were shouting through their\\n masks, but I couldn\\'t hear them.\\n The air is too thin to carry sound\\n well.\\n\\n\\n All at once, something gleamed\\n in their hands, and they started\\n shooting at me with their rifles.\\n That\\'s when I heard the noise behind\\n me. I was too scared to turn\\n around, but finally Jones and Lloyd\\n came running over, and I got up\\n enough nerve to look. There was\\n nothing there, but on the sand,\\n paralleling mine, were footprints.\\n At least I think they were footprints.\\n Twice as long as mine, and\\n three times as wide, but kind of\\n featureless because the sand\\'s loose\\n and dry. They doubled back on\\n themselves, spaced considerably\\n farther apart.\\n\\n\\n \"What was it?\" I asked Lloyd\\n when he got to me.\\n\\n\\n \"Damned if I know,\" he said. \"It\\n was red and scaly, and I think it\\n had a tail. It was two heads taller\\n than you.\" He shuddered. \"Ran off\\n when we fired.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Where,\" said Jones, \"are Pat and\\n Kroger?\"\\n\\n\\n I didn\\'t know. I hadn\\'t seen\\n them, nor the jeep, on my trip back.\\n So we followed the wheel tracks for\\n a while, and they veered off from\\n my trail and followed another, very\\n much like the one that had been\\n paralleling mine when Jones and\\n Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly\\n thing.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'d better get them on the\\n radio,\" said Jones, turning back\\n toward the ship.\\n\\n\\n There wasn\\'t anything on the\\n radio but static.\\n\\n\\n Pat and Kroger haven\\'t come\\n back yet, either.\\nJune 21, 1961\\nWe\\'re not\\n alone here. More of\\n the scaly things have come toward\\n the camp, but a few rifle shots send\\n them away. They hop like kangaroos\\n when they\\'re startled. Their\\n attitudes aren\\'t menacing, but their\\n appearance is. And Jones says,\\n \"Who knows what\\'s \\'menacing\\' in\\n an alien?\"\\n\\n\\n We\\'re going to look for Kroger\\n and Pat today. Jones says we\\'d better\\n before another windstorm blows\\n away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,\\n the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we\\n always have the smears to follow,\\n unless they get covered up, too.\\n We\\'re taking extra oxygen, shells,\\n and rifles. Food, too, of course.\\n And we\\'re locking up the ship.\\nIt\\'s later\\n , now. We found the\\n jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of\\n those big tracks nearby. We\\'re taking\\n the jeep to follow the aliens\\'\\n tracks. There\\'s some moss around\\n here, on reddish brown rocks that\\n stick up through the sand, just on\\n the shady side, though. Kroger\\n must be happy to have found his\\n lichen.\\n\\n\\n The trail ended at the brink of\\n a deep crevice in the ground. Seems\\n to be an earthquake-type split in\\n solid rock, with the sand sifting\\n over this and the far edge like pink\\n silk cataracts. The bottom is in the\\n shade and can\\'t be seen. The crack\\n seems to extend to our left and\\n right as far as we can look.\\n\\n\\n There looks like a trail down the\\n inside of the crevice, but the Sun\\'s\\n setting, so we\\'re waiting till tomorrow\\n to go down.\\n\\n\\n Going down was Jones\\' idea,\\n not mine.\\nJune 22, 1961\\nWell, we\\'re\\n at the bottom, and\\n there\\'s water here, a shallow stream\\n about thirty feet wide that runs\\n along the center of the canal \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mwe\\'ve\\n decided we\\'re in a canal\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. No sign\\n of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand\\n here is hard-packed and damp, and\\n there are normal-size footprints\\n mingled with the alien ones, sharp\\n and clear. The aliens seem to have\\n six or seven toes. It varies from\\n print to print. And they\\'re barefoot,\\n too, or else they have the damnedest-looking\\n shoes in creation.\\n\\n\\n The constant shower of sand\\n near the cliff walls is annoying, but\\n it\\'s sandless \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mshower-wise\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m near\\n the stream, so we\\'re following the\\n footprints along the bank. Also, the\\n air\\'s better down here. Still thin,\\n but not so bad as on the surface.\\n We\\'re going without masks to save\\n oxygen for the return trip \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mJones\\n assures me there\\'ll\\nbe\\na return\\n trip\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, and the air\\'s only a little bit\\n sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose\\n and mouth solve this.\\n\\n\\n We look like desperadoes, what\\n with the rifles and covered faces. I\\n said as much to Lloyd and he told\\n me to shut up. Moss all over the\\n cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger.\\nWe\\'ve found\\n Kroger and Pat,\\n with the help of the aliens. Or maybe\\n I should call them the Martians.\\n Either way, it\\'s better than what\\n Jones calls them.\\n\\n\\n They took away our rifles and\\n brought us right to Kroger and Pat,\\n without our even asking. Jones is\\n mad at the way they got the rifles so\\n easily. When we came upon them\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32ma group of maybe ten, huddling\\n behind a boulder in ambush\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, he\\n fired, but the shots either bounced\\n off their scales or stuck in their\\n thick hides. Anyway, they took the\\n rifles away and threw them into the\\n stream, and picked us all up and\\n took us into a hole in the cliff wall.\\n The hole went on practically forever,\\n but it didn\\'t get dark. Kroger\\n tells me that there are phosphorescent\\n bacteria living in the mold on\\n the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave\\n smell, but it\\'s richer in oxygen\\n than even at the stream.\\n\\n\\n We\\'re in a small cave that is just\\n off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels\\n come together. I can\\'t remember\\n which one we came in through,\\n and neither can anyone else. Jones\\n asked me what the hell I kept writing\\n in the diary for, did I want to\\n make it a gift to Martian archeologists?\\n But I said where there\\'s life\\n there\\'s hope, and now he won\\'t talk\\n to me. I congratulated Kroger on\\n the lichen I\\'d seen, but he just said\\n a short and unscientific word and\\n went to sleep.\\n\\n\\n There\\'s a Martian guarding the\\n entrance to our cave. I don\\'t know\\n what they intend to do with us.\\n Feed us, I hope. So far, they\\'ve just\\n left us here, and we\\'re out of rations.\\n\\n\\n Kroger tried talking to the guard\\n once, but he \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mor it\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m made a whistling\\n kind of sound and flashed a\\n mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the\\n teeth are in multiple rows, like a\\n tiger shark\\'s. I\\'d rather he hadn\\'t\\n told me.\\nJune 23, 1961, I think\\nWe\\'re either\\n in a docket or a\\n zoo. I can\\'t tell which. There\\'s a\\n rather square platform surrounded\\n on all four sides by running water,\\n maybe twenty feet across, and\\n we\\'re on it. Martians keep coming\\n to the far edge of the water and\\n looking at us and whistling at each\\n other. A little Martian came near\\n the edge of the water and a larger\\n Martian whistled like crazy and\\n dragged it away.\\n\\n\\n \"Water must be dangerous to\\n them,\" said Kroger.\\n\\n\\n \"We shoulda brought water pistols,\"\\n Jones muttered.\\n\\n\\n Pat said maybe we can swim to\\n safety. Kroger told Pat he was\\n crazy, that the little island we\\'re on\\n here underground is bordered by a\\n fast river that goes into the planet.\\n We\\'d end up drowned in some grotto\\n in the heart of the planet, says\\n Kroger.\\n\\n\\n \"What the hell,\" says Pat, \"it\\'s\\n better than starving.\"\\n\\n\\n It is not.\\nJune 24, 1961, probably\\nI\\'m hungry\\n . So is everybody\\n else. Right now I could eat a dinner\\n raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it\\n down. A Martian threw a stone at\\n Jones today, and Jones threw one\\n back at him and broke off a couple\\n of scales. The Martian whistled\\n furiously and went away. When the\\n crowd thinned out, same as it did\\n yesterday \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mmust be some sort of\\n sleeping cycle here\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m, Kroger talked\\n Lloyd into swimming across the\\n river and getting the red scales.\\n Lloyd started at the upstream part\\n of the current, and was about a hundred\\n yards below this underground\\n island before he made the far side.\\n Sure is a swift current.\\n\\n\\n But he got the scales, walked\\n very far upstream of us, and swam\\n back with them. The stream sides\\n are steep, like in a fjord, and we\\n had to lift him out of the swirling\\n cold water, with the scales gripped\\n in his fist. Or what was left of the\\n scales. They had melted down in\\n the water and left his hand all\\n sticky.\\n\\n\\n Kroger took the gummy things,\\n studied them in the uncertain light,\\n then tasted them and grinned.\\n\\n\\n The Martians are made of sugar.\\nLater, same day\\n . Kroger\\n said that the Martian metabolism\\n must be like Terran \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mEarth-type\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n metabolism, only with no pancreas\\n to make insulin.

Kroger says\\n there are two baby Martians loose\\n on board ship. Pat told him he\\n was nuts, but there are certain\\n signs he\\'s right. Like the missing\\n charcoal in the air-filtration-and-reclaiming\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mAFAR\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m system. And\\n the water gauges are going down.\\n But the clincher is those two sugar\\n crystals Lloyd had grabbed up\\n when we were in that zoo. They\\'re\\n gone.\\n\\n\\n Pat has declared a state of emergency.\\n Quick thinking, that\\'s Pat.\\n Lloyd, before he remembered and\\n turned scarlet, suggested we radio\\n Earth for instructions. We can\\'t.\\n\\n\\n Here we are, somewhere in a\\n void headed for Earth, with enough\\n air and water left for maybe three\\n days—if the Martians don\\'t take\\n any more.\\n\\n\\n Kroger is thrilled that he is\\n learning something, maybe, about\\n Martian reproductive processes.\\n When he told Pat, Pat put it to a\\n vote whether or not to jettison\\n Kroger through the airlock. However,\\n it was decided that responsibility\\n was pretty well divided.\\n Lloyd had gotten the crystals,\\n Kroger had only studied them, and\\n Jones had brought them aboard.\\n\\n\\n So Kroger stays, but meanwhile\\n the air is getting worse. Pat suggested\\n Kroger put us all into a state\\n of suspended animation till landing\\n time, eight months away. Kroger\\n said, \"How?\"\\nJune 27, 1961\\nAir is foul\\n and I\\'m very\\n thirsty. Kroger says that at least—when\\n the Martians get bigger—they\\'ll\\n have to show themselves.\\n Pat says what do we do\\nthen\\n? We\\n can\\'t afford the water we need to\\n melt them down. Besides, the\\n melted crystals might\\nall\\nturn into\\n little Martians.\\n\\n\\n Jones says he\\'ll go down spitting.\\n\\n\\n Pat says why not dismantle interior\\n of rocket to find out where\\n they\\'re holing up? Fine idea.\\n\\n\\n How do you dismantle riveted\\n metal plates?\\nJune 28, 1961\\nThe AFAR system\\n is no more\\n and the water gauges are still dropping.\\n Kroger suggests baking bread,\\n then slicing it, then toasting it till\\n it turns to carbon, and we can use\\n the carbon in the AFAR system.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ll have to try it, I guess.\\nThe Martians\\n ate the bread.\\n Jones came forward to tell us the\\n loaves were cooling, and when he\\n got back they were gone. However,\\n he did find a few of the red crystals\\n on the galley deck \u001B[0m\u001B[32m(\u001B[0m\u001B[32mfloor\u001B[0m\u001B[32m)\u001B[0m\u001B[32m. They\\'re\\n good-sized crystals, too. Which\\n means so are the Martians.\\n\\n\\n Kroger says the Martians must\\n be intelligent, otherwise they\\n couldn\\'t have guessed at the carbohydrates\\n present in the bread after\\n a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat\\n says let\\'s jettison Kroger.\\n\\n\\n This time the vote went against\\n Kroger, but he got a last-minute reprieve\\n by suggesting the crystals\\n be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric\\n acid. He says this\\'ll produce\\n carbon.\\n\\n\\n I certainly hope so.\\n\\n\\n So does Kroger.\\nBrief reprieve\\n for us. The\\n acid-sugar combination not only\\n produces carbon but water vapor,\\n and the gauge has gone up a notch.\\n That means that we have a quart\\n of water in the tanks for drinking.\\n However, the air\\'s a bit better,\\n and we voted to let Kroger stay inside\\n the rocket.\\n\\n\\n Meantime, we have to catch\\n those Martians.\\nJune 29, 1961\\nWorse and worse\\n . Lloyd\\n caught one of the Martians in the\\n firing chamber. We had to flood\\n the chamber with acid to subdue\\n the creature, which carbonized\\n nicely. So now we have plenty of\\n air and water again, but besides\\n having another Martian still on\\n the loose, we now don\\'t have\\n enough acid left in the fuel tanks\\n to make a landing.\\n\\n\\n Pat says at least our vector will\\n carry us to Earth and we can die\\n on our home planet, which is better\\n than perishing in space.\\n\\n\\n The hell it is.\\nMarch 3, 1962\\nEarth in sight\\n . The other\\n Martian is still with us. He\\'s where\\n we can\\'t get at him without blow-torches,\\n but he can\\'t get at the carbon\\n in the AFAR system, either,\\n which is a help. However, his tail\\n is prehensile, and now and then it\\n snakes out through an air duct and\\n yanks food right off the table from\\n under our noses.\\n\\n\\n Kroger says watch out.\\nWe\\nare\\n made of carbohydrates, too. I\\'d\\n rather not have known.\\nMarch 4, 1962\\nEarth fills\\n the screen in the\\n control room. Pat says if we\\'re\\n lucky, he might be able to use the\\n bit of fuel we have left to set us\\n in a descending spiral into one of\\n the oceans. The rocket is tighter\\n than a submarine, he insists, and\\n it will float till we\\'re rescued, if\\n the plates don\\'t crack under the impact.\\n\\n\\n We all agreed to try it. Not that\\n we thought it had a good chance of\\n working, but none of us had a better\\n idea.\\nI guess\\n you know the rest of\\n the story, about how that destroyer\\n spotted us and got us and\\n my diary aboard, and towed the\\n rocket to San Francisco. News of\\n the \"captured Martian\" leaked out,\\n and we all became nine-day wonders\\n until the dismantling of the\\n rocket.\\n\\n\\n Kroger says he must have dissolved\\n in the water, and wonders\\n what\\nthat\\nwould do. There are\\n about a thousand of those crystal-scales\\n on a Martian.\\n\\n\\n So last week we found out, when\\n those red-scaled things began clambering\\n out of the sea on every coastal\\n region on Earth. Kroger tried\\n to explain to me about salinity osmosis\\n and hydrostatic pressure and\\n crystalline life, but in no time at all\\n he lost me.\\n\\n\\n The point is, bullets won\\'t stop\\n these things, and wherever a crystal\\n falls, a new Martian springs up\\n in a few weeks. It looks like the\\n five of us have abetted an invasion\\n from Mars.\\n\\n\\n Needless to say, we\\'re no longer\\n heroes.\\n\\n\\n I haven\\'t heard from Pat or\\n Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked\\n up attacking a candy factory yesterday,\\n and Kroger and I were allowed\\n to sign on for the flight to\\n Venus scheduled within the next\\n few days—because of our experience.\\n\\n\\n Kroger says there\\'s only enough\\n fuel for a one-way trip. I don\\'t care.\\n I\\'ve always wanted to travel with\\n the President.\\n—JACK SHARKEY\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nGalaxy Magazine\\nJune 1960.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

The truth lurked\\n in some corner of his consciousness,\\n but it was not reached by surface\\n awareness.\\n\\n\\n The corridor opened at last into\\n a large high-domed room, much\\n like a railway station or an air terminal.\\n He walked straight ahead.\\n\\n\\n At the sight of him a man leaning\\n negligently against a stone pillar,\\n to his right but within vision,\\n straightened and barked an order\\n to him, “Halt!” He lengthened his\\n stride but gave no other sign.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 136\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Two men hurried through a\\n doorway of a small anteroom to his\\n left, calling to him. He turned away\\n and began to run.\\n\\n\\n Shouts and the sound of charging\\n feet came from behind him. He\\n cut to the right, running toward the\\n escalator to the second floor. Another\\n pair of men were hurrying\\n down, two steps at a stride. With\\n no break in pace he veered into an\\n opening beside the escalator.\\n\\n\\n At the first turn he saw that the\\n aisle merely circled the stairway,\\n coming out into the depot again on\\n the other side. It was a trap. He\\n glanced quickly around him.\\n\\n\\n At the rear of the space was a\\n row of lockers for traveler use. He\\n slipped a coin into a pay slot,\\n opened the zipper on his bag and\\n pulled out a flat briefcase. It took\\n him only a few seconds to push the\\n case into the compartment, lock it\\n and slide the key along the floor\\n beneath the locker.\\n\\n\\n There was nothing to do after\\n that—except wait.\\n\\n\\n The men pursuing him came\\n hurtling around the turn in the\\n aisle. He kicked his knapsack to\\n one side, spreading his feet wide\\n with an instinctive motion.\\n\\n\\n Until that instant he had intended\\n to fight. Now he swiftly\\n reassessed the odds. There were\\n five of them, he saw. He should be\\n able to incapacitate two or three\\n and break out. But the fact that\\n they had been expecting him meant\\n that others would very probably\\n be waiting outside. His best course\\n now was to sham ignorance. He\\n relaxed.\\n\\n\\n He offered no resistance as they\\n reached him.\\n\\n\\n They were not gentle men. A tall\\n ruffian, copper-brown face damp\\n with perspiration and body oil,\\n grabbed him by the jacket and\\n slammed him back against the\\n lockers. As he shifted his weight\\n to keep his footing someone drove\\n a fist into his face. He started to\\n raise his hands; and a hard flat\\n object crashed against the side of\\n his skull.\\n\\n\\n The starch went out of his legs.\\n“D\\n O you make anything out of\\n it?” the psychoanalyst Milton\\n Bergstrom, asked.\\n\\n\\n John Zarwell shook his head.\\n “Did I talk while I was under?”\\n\\n\\n “Oh, yes. You were supposed to.\\n That way I follow pretty well what\\n you’re reenacting.”\\n\\n\\n “How does it tie in with what I\\n told you before?”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom’s neat-boned, fair-skinned\\n face betrayed no emotion\\n other than an introspective stillness\\n of his normally alert gaze. “I see\\n no connection,” he decided, his\\n words once again precise and meticulous.\\n “We don’t have enough to\\n go on. Do you feel able to try another\\n comanalysis this afternoon\\n yet?”\\n\\n\\n “I don’t see why not.” Zarwell\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 137\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n opened the collar of his shirt. The\\n day was hot, and the room had no\\n air conditioning, still a rare luxury\\n on St. Martin’s. The office window\\n was open, but it let in no freshness,\\n only the mildly rank odor that pervaded\\n all the planet’s habitable\\n area.\\n\\n\\n “Good.” Bergstrom rose. “The\\n serum is quite harmless, John.” He\\n maintained a professional diversionary\\n chatter as he administered\\n the drug. “A scopolamine derivative\\n that’s been well tested.”\\n\\n\\n The floor beneath Zarwell’s feet\\n assumed abruptly the near transfluent\\n consistency of a damp\\n sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave\\n and rolled gently toward the far\\n wall.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom continued talking,\\n with practiced urbanity. “When\\n psychiatry was a less exact science,”\\n his voice went on, seeming to come\\n from a great distance, “a doctor\\n had to spend weeks, sometimes\\n months or years interviewing a\\n patient. If he was skilled enough,\\n he could sort the relevancies from\\n the vast amount of chaff. We are\\n able now, with the help of the\\n serum, to confine our discourses to\\n matters cogent to the patient’s\\n trouble.”\\n\\n\\n The floor continued its transmutation,\\n and Zarwell sank deep into\\n viscous depths. “Lie back and relax.\\n Don’t\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n The words tumbled down from\\n above. They faded, were gone.\\nZARWELL found himself\\nstanding on a vast plain. There was\\n no sky above, and no horizon in the\\n distance. He was in a place without\\n space or dimension. There was\\n nothing here except himself—and\\n the gun that he held in his hand.\\n\\n\\n A weapon beautiful in its efficient\\n simplicity.\\n\\n\\n He should know all about the\\n instrument, its purpose and workings,\\n but he could not bring his\\n thoughts into rational focus. His\\n forehead creased with his mental\\n effort.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly the unreality about\\n him shifted perspective. He was\\n approaching—not walking, but\\n merely shortening the space between\\n them—the man who held\\n the gun. The man who was himself.\\n The other “himself” drifted\\n nearer also, as though drawn by a\\n mutual attraction.\\n\\n\\n The man with the gun raised his\\n weapon and pressed the trigger.\\n\\n\\n With the action the perspective\\n shifted again. He was watching the\\n face of the man he shot jerk and\\n twitch, expand and contract. The\\n face was unharmed, yet it was no\\n longer the same. No longer his own\\n features.\\n\\n\\n The stranger face smiled approvingly\\n at him.\\n“O\\n DD,” Bergstrom said.\\nHe brought his hands up and joined\\n the tips of his fingers against his\\n chest. “But it’s another piece in the\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 138\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n jig-saw. In time it will fit into\\n place.” He paused. “It means no\\n more to you than the first, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n “No,” Zarwell answered.\\n\\n\\n He was not a talking man, Bergstrom\\n reflected. It was more than\\n reticence, however. The man had\\n a hard granite core, only partially\\n concealed by his present perplexity.\\n He was a man who could handle\\n himself well in an emergency.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing\\n his strayed thoughts. “I expected\\n as much. A quite normal first phase\\n of treatment.” He straightened a\\n paper on his desk. “I think that will\\n be enough for today. Twice in one\\n sitting is about all we ever try.\\n Otherwise some particular episode\\n might cause undue mental stress,\\n and set up a block.” He glanced\\n down at his appointment pad. “Tomorrow\\n at two, then?”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell grunted acknowledgment\\n and pushed himself to his\\n feet, apparently unaware that his\\n shirt clung damply to his body.\\nTHE sun was still high when\\n Zarwell left the analyst’s office.\\n The white marble of the city’s\\n buildings shimmered in the afternoon\\n heat, squat and austere as\\n giant tree trunks, pock-marked and\\n gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell\\n was careful not to rest his hand\\n on the flesh searing surface of the\\n stone.\\n\\n\\n The evening meal hour was approaching\\n when he reached the\\n Flats, on the way to his apartment.\\n The streets of the old section were\\n near-deserted. The only sounds he\\n heard as he passed were the occasional\\n cry of a baby, chronically\\n uncomfortable in the day’s heat,\\n and the lowing of imported cattle\\n waiting in a nearby shed to be\\n shipped to the country.\\n\\n\\n All St. Martin’s has a distinctive\\n smell, as of an arid dried-out\\n swamp, with a faint taint of fish.\\n But in the Flats the odor changes.\\n Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,\\n and trading marts; the smell\\n of stale cooking drifting from the\\n homes of the laborers and lower\\n class techmen who live there.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell passed a group of\\n smaller children playing a desultory\\n game of lic-lic for pieces of\\n candy and cigarettes. Slowly he\\n climbed the stairs of a stone flat.\\n He prepared a supper for himself\\n and ate it without either enjoyment\\n or distaste. He lay down, fully\\n clothed, on his bed. The visit to the\\n analyst had done nothing to dispel\\n his ennui.\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 139\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n\\n The next morning when Zarwell\\n awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.\\n The feeling was there\\n again, like a scene waiting only to\\n be gazed at directly to be perceived.\\n It was as though a great wisdom\\n lay at the edge of understanding.\\n If he rested quietly it would\\n all come to him. Yet always, when\\n his mind lost its sleep-induced\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 140\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n lethargy, the moment of near understanding\\n slipped away.\\n\\n\\n This morning, however, the sense\\n of disorientation did not pass with\\n full wakefulness. He achieved no\\n understanding, but the strangeness\\n did not leave as he sat up.\\n\\n\\n He gazed about him. The room\\n did not seem to be his own. The\\n furnishings, and the clothing he observed\\n in a closet, might have belonged\\n to a stranger.\\n\\n\\n He pulled himself from his blankets,\\n his body moving with mechanical\\n reaction. The slippers into\\n which he put his feet were larger\\n than he had expected them to be.\\n He walked about the small apartment.\\n The place was familiar, but\\n only as it would have been if he\\n had studied it from blueprints, not\\n as though he lived there.\\n\\n\\n The feeling was still with him\\n when he returned to the psychoanalyst.\\nTHE scene this time was more\\n kaleidoscopic, less personal.\\n\\n\\n A village was being ravaged.\\n Men struggled and died in the\\n streets. Zarwell moved among\\n them, seldom taking part in the\\n individual clashes, yet a moving\\n force in the\\n conflict\\n .\\n\\n\\n The background changed. He\\n understood that he was on a different\\n world.\\n\\n\\n Here a city burned. Its resistance\\n was nearing its end. Zarwell was\\n riding a shaggy pony outside a high\\n wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.\\n He moved in and joined a\\n party of short, bearded men, directing\\n them as they battered at the\\n wall with a huge log mounted on a\\n many-wheeled truck.\\n\\n\\n The log broke a breach in the\\n concrete and the besiegers charged\\n through, carrying back the defenders\\n who sought vainly to plug the\\n gap. Soon there would be rioting\\n in the streets again, plundering and\\n killing.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell was not the leader of the\\n invaders, only a lesser figure in the\\n rebellion. But he had played a leading\\n part in the planning of the\\n strategy that led to the city’s fall.\\n The job had been well done.\\n\\n\\n Time passed, without visible\\n break in the panorama. Now Zarwell\\n was fleeing, pursued by the\\n same bearded men who had been\\n his comrades before. Still he moved\\n with the same firm purpose, vigilant,\\n resourceful, and well prepared\\n for the eventuality that had befallen.\\n He made his escape without\\n difficulty.\\n\\n\\n He alighted from a space ship on\\n still another world—another shift\\n in time—and the atmosphere of\\n conflict engulfed him.\\n\\n\\n Weary but resigned he accepted\\n it, and did what he had to do\\xa0…\\nBERGSTROM was regarding\\nhim with speculative scrutiny.\\n “You’ve had quite a past, apparently,”\\n he observed.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 141\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.\\n “At least in my dreams.”\\n\\n\\n “Dreams?” Bergstrom’s eyes\\n widened in surprise. “Oh, I beg your\\n pardon. I must have forgotten to\\n explain. This work is so routine to\\n me that sometimes I forget it’s all\\n new to a patient. Actually what you\\n experienced under the drug were\\n not dreams. They were recollections\\n of real episodes from your\\n past.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell’s expression became\\n wary. He watched Bergstrom\\n closely. After a minute, however,\\n he seemed satisfied, and he let himself\\n settle back against the cushion\\n of his chair. “I remember nothing\\n of what I saw,” he observed.\\n\\n\\n “That’s why you’re here, you\\n know,” Bergstrom answered. “To\\n help you remember.”\\n\\n\\n “But everything under the drug\\n is so\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n “Haphazard? That’s true. The\\n recall episodes are always purely\\n random, with no chronological sequence.\\n Our problem will be to reassemble\\n them in proper order\\n later. Or some particular scene may\\n trigger a complete memory return.\\n\\n\\n “It is my considered opinion,”\\n Bergstrom went on, “that your lost\\n memory will turn out to be no ordinary\\n amnesia. I believe we will find\\n that your mind has been tampered\\n with.”\\n\\n\\n “Nothing I’ve seen under the\\n drug fits into the past I do remember.”\\n\\n\\n “That’s what makes me so certain,”\\n Bergstrom said confidently.\\n “You don’t remember what we\\n have shown to be true. Conversely\\n then, what you think you remember\\n must be false. It must have been\\n implanted there. But we can go\\n into that later. For today I think\\n we have done enough. This episode\\n was quite prolonged.”\\n\\n\\n “I won’t have any time off again\\n until next week end,” Zarwell reminded\\n him.\\n\\n\\n “That’s right.” Bergstrom\\n thought for a moment. “We\\n shouldn’t let this hang too long.\\n Could you come here after work\\n tomorrow?”\\n\\n\\n “I suppose I could.”\\n\\n\\n “Fine,” Bergstrom said with satisfaction.\\n “I’ll admit I’m considerably\\n more than casually interested\\n in your case by this time.”\\nA WORK truck picked Zarwell\\n up the next morning and he\\n rode with a tech crew to the edge of\\n the reclam area. Beside the belt\\n bringing ocean muck from the converter\\n plant at the seashore his\\n bulldozer was waiting.\\n\\n\\n He took his place behind the\\n drive wheel and began working dirt\\n down between windbreakers anchored\\n in the rock. Along a makeshift\\n road into the badlands trucks\\n brought crushed lime and phosphorus\\n to supplement the ocean\\n sediment. The progress of life from\\n the sea to the land was a mechanical\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 142\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n process of this growing world.\\n\\n\\n Nearly two hundred years ago,\\n when Earth established a colony on\\n St. Martin’s, the land surface of the\\n planet had been barren. Only its\\n seas thrived with animal and vegetable\\n life. The necessary machinery\\n and technicians had been supplied\\n by Earth, and the long struggle began\\n to fit the world for human\\n needs. When Zarwell arrived, six\\n months before, the vitalized area\\n already extended three hundred\\n miles along the coast, and sixty\\n miles inland. And every day the\\n progress continued. A large percentage\\n of the energy and resources\\n of the world were devoted to that\\n essential expansion.\\n\\n\\n The reclam crews filled and\\n sodded the sterile rock, planted\\n binding grasses, grain and trees, and\\n diverted rivers to keep it fertile.\\n When there were no rivers to divert\\n they blasted out springs and lakes\\n in the foothills to make their own.\\n Biologists developed the necessary\\n germ and insect life from what they\\n found in the sea. Where that failed,\\n they imported microorganisms\\n from Earth.\\n\\n\\n Three rubber-tracked crawlers\\n picked their way down from the\\n mountains until they joined the\\n road passing the belt. They were\\n loaded with ore that would be\\n smelted into metal for depleted\\n Earth, or for other colonies short\\n of minerals. It was St. Martin’s only\\n export thus far.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell pulled his sun helmet\\n lower, to better guard his hot, dry\\n features. The wind blew continuously\\n on St. Martin’s, but it furnished\\n small relief from the heat.\\n After its three-thousand-mile journey\\n across scorched sterile rock, it\\n sucked the moisture from a man’s\\n body, bringing a membrane-shrinking\\n dryness to the nostrils as it was\\n breathed in. With it came also the\\n cloying taste of limestone in a\\n worker’s mouth.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell gazed idly about at the\\n other laborers. Fully three-quarters\\n of them were beri-rabza ridden. A\\n cure for the skin fungus had not\\n yet been found; the men’s faces\\n and hands were scabbed and red.\\n The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,\\n would soon have a moderate\\n prosperity, yet they still\\n lacked adequate medical and research\\n facilities.\\n\\n\\n Not all the world’s citizens were\\n content.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom was waiting in his office\\n when Zarwell arrived that\\n evening.\\nHE was lying motionless on a\\n hard cot, with his eyes closed,\\n yet with his every sense sharply\\n quickened. Tentatively he tightened\\n small muscles in his arms and\\n legs. Across his wrists and thighs\\n he felt straps binding him to the\\n cot.\\n\\n\\n “So that’s our big, bad man,” a\\n coarse voice above him observed\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 143\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n caustically. “He doesn’t look so\\n tough now, does he?”\\n\\n\\n “It might have been better to\\n kill him right away,” a second, less\\n confident voice said. “It’s supposed\\n to be impossible to hold him.”\\n\\n\\n “Don’t be stupid. We just do\\n what we’re told. We’ll hold him.”\\n\\n\\n “What do you think they’ll do\\n with him?”\\n\\n\\n “Execute him, I suppose,” the\\n harsh voice said matter-of-factly.\\n “They’re probably just curious to\\n see what he looks like first. They’ll\\n be disappointed.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to\\n observe his surroundings.\\n\\n\\n It was a mistake. “He’s out of\\n it,” the first speaker said, and Zarwell\\n allowed his eyes to open fully.\\n\\n\\n The voice, he saw, belonged to\\n the big man who had bruised him\\n against the locker at the spaceport.\\n Irrelevantly he wondered how he\\n knew now that it had been a spaceport.\\n\\n\\n His captor’s broad face jeered\\n down at Zarwell. “Have a good\\n sleep?” he asked with mock solicitude.\\n Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge\\n that he heard.\\n\\n\\n The big man turned. “You can\\n tell the Chief he’s awake,” he said.\\n Zarwell followed his gaze to where\\n a younger man, with a blond lock of\\n hair on his forehead, stood behind\\n him. The youth nodded and went\\n out, while the other pulled a chair\\n up to the side of Zarwell’s cot.\\n\\n\\n While their attention was away\\n from him Zarwell had unobtrusively\\n loosened his bonds as much as\\n possible with arm leverage. As the\\n big man drew his chair nearer, he\\n made the hand farthest from him\\n tight and compact and worked it\\n free of the leather loop. He waited.\\n\\n\\n The big man belched. “You’re\\n supposed to be great stuff in a situation\\n like this,” he said, his smoke-tan\\n face splitting in a grin that revealed\\n large square teeth. “How\\n about giving me a sample?”\\n\\n\\n “You’re a yellow-livered bastard,”\\n Zarwell told him.\\n\\n\\n The grin faded from the oily face\\n as the man stood up. He leaned over\\n the cot—and Zarwell’s left hand\\n shot up and locked about his throat,\\n joined almost immediately by the\\n right.\\n\\n\\n The man’s mouth opened and he\\n tried to yell as he threw himself\\n frantically backward. He clawed at\\n the hands about his neck. When\\n that failed to break the grip he suddenly\\n reversed his weight and\\n drove his fist at Zarwell’s head.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell pulled the struggling\\n body down against his chest and\\n held it there until all agitated\\n movement ceased. He sat up then,\\n letting the body slide to the floor.\\n\\n\\n The straps about his thighs came\\n loose with little effort.\\nTHE analyst dabbed at his upper\\n lip with a handkerchief. “The\\n episodes are beginning to tie together,”\\n he said, with an attempt at\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 144\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n nonchalance. “The next couple\\n should do it.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell did not answer. His\\n memory seemed on the point of\\n complete return, and he sat quietly,\\n hopefully. However, nothing more\\n came and he returned his attention\\n to his more immediate problem.\\n\\n\\n Opening a button on his shirt, he\\n pulled back a strip of plastic cloth\\n just below his rib cage and took\\n out a small flat pistol. He held it\\n in the palm of his hand. He knew\\n now why he always carried it.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom had his bad moment.\\n “You’re not going to\\xa0…” he began\\n at the sight of the gun. He tried\\n again. “You must be joking.”\\n\\n\\n “I have very little sense of humor,”\\n Zarwell corrected him.\\n\\n\\n “You’d be foolish!”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom obviously realized\\n how close he was to death. Yet\\n surprisingly, after the first start,\\n he showed little fear. Zarwell had\\n thought the man a bit soft, too\\n adjusted to a life of ease and some\\n prestige to meet danger calmly.\\n Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.\\n\\n\\n “Why would I be foolish?” he\\n asked. “Your Meninger oath of inviolable\\n confidence?”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom shook his head. “I\\n know it’s been broken before. But\\n you need me. You’re not through,\\n you know. If you killed me you’d\\n still have to trust some other\\n analyst.”\\n\\n\\n “Is that the best you can do?”\\n\\n\\n “No.” Bergstrom was angry now.\\n “But use that logical mind you’re\\n supposed to have! Scenes before\\n this have shown what kind of man\\n you are. Just because this last happened\\n here on St. Martin’s makes\\n little difference. If I was going to\\n turn you in to the police, I’d have\\n done it before this.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell debated with himself the\\n truth of what the other had said.\\n “Why didn’t you turn me in?” he\\n asked.\\n\\n\\n “Because you’re no mad-dog\\n killer!” Now that the crisis seemed\\n to be past, Bergstrom spoke more\\n calmly, even allowed himself to\\n relax. “You’re still pretty much in\\n the fog about yourself. I read more\\n in those comanalyses than you did.\\n I even know who you are!”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell’s eyebrows raised.\\n\\n\\n “Who am I?” he asked, very interested\\n now. Without attention he\\n put his pistol away in a trouser\\n pocket.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom brushed the question\\n aside with one hand. “Your name\\n makes little difference. You’ve used\\n many. But you are an idealist. Your\\n killings were necessary to bring\\n justice to the places you visited. By\\n now you’re almost a legend among\\n the human worlds. I’d like to talk\\n more with you on that later.”\\n\\n\\n While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom\\n pressed his advantage. “One\\n more scene might do it,” he said.\\n “Should we try again—if you trust\\n me, that is?”\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 145\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Zarwell made his decision quickly.\\n “Go ahead,” he answered.\\nALL Zarwell’s attention seemed\\n on the cigar he lit as he rode\\n down the escalator, but he surveyed\\n the terminal carefully over the rim\\n of his hand. He spied no suspicious\\n loungers.\\n\\n\\n Behind the escalator he groped\\n along the floor beneath the lockers\\n until he found his key. The briefcase\\n was under his arm a minute\\n later.\\n\\n\\n In the basement lave he put a\\n coin in the pay slot of a private\\n compartment and went in.\\n\\n\\n As he zipped open the briefcase\\n he surveyed his features in the mirror.\\n A small muscle at the corner of\\n one eye twitched spasmodically.\\n One cheek wore a frozen quarter\\n smile. Thirty-six hours under the\\n paralysis was longer than advisable.\\n The muscles should be rested at\\n least every twenty hours.\\n\\n\\n Fortunately his natural features\\n would serve as an adequate disguise\\n now.\\n\\n\\n He adjusted the ring setting on\\n the pistol-shaped instrument that\\n he took from his case, and carefully\\n rayed several small areas of\\n his face, loosening muscles that had\\n been tight too long. He sighed\\n gratefully when he finished, massaging\\n his cheeks and forehead with\\n considerable pleasure. Another\\n glance in the mirror satisfied him\\n with the changes that had been\\n made. He turned to his briefcase\\n again and exchanged the gun for\\n a small syringe, which he pushed\\n into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged\\n razor blade.\\n\\n\\n Removing his fiber-cloth jacket\\n he slashed it into strips with the\\n razor blade and flushed it down the\\n disposal bowl. With the sleeves of\\n his blouse rolled up he had the\\n appearance of a typical workman\\n as he strolled from the compartment.\\n\\n\\n Back at the locker he replaced\\n the briefcase and, with a wad of\\n gum, glued the key to the bottom\\n of the locker frame.\\n\\n\\n One step more. Taking the syringe\\n from his pocket, he plunged\\n the needle into his forearm and\\n tossed the instrument down a\\n waste chute. He took three more\\n steps and paused uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n When he looked about him it\\n was with the expression of a man\\n waking from a vivid dream.\\n“Q\\n UITE ingenious,” Graves\\n murmured admiringly. “You\\n had your mind already preconditioned\\n for the shot. But why would\\n you deliberately give yourself amnesia?”\\n\\n\\n “What better disguise than to\\n believe the part you’re playing?”\\n\\n\\n “A good man must have done\\n that job on your mind,” Bergstrom\\n commented. “I’d have hesitated to\\n try it myself. It must have taken a\\n lot of trust on your part.”\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 146\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n “Trust and money,” Zarwell said\\n drily.\\n\\n\\n “Your memory’s back then?”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell nodded.\\n\\n\\n “I’m glad to hear that,” Bergstrom\\n assured him. “Now that\\n you’re well again I’d like to introduce\\n you to a man named Vernon\\n Johnson. This world\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell stopped him with an upraised\\n hand. “Good God, man, can’t\\n you see the reason for all this? I’m\\n tired. I’m trying to quit.”\\n\\n\\n “Quit?” Bergstrom did not quite\\n follow him.\\n\\n\\n “It started on my home colony,”\\n Zarwell explained listlessly. “A\\n gang of hoods had taken over the\\n government. I helped organize a\\n movement to get them out. There\\n was some bloodshed, but it went\\n quite well. Several months later an\\n unofficial envoy from another\\n world asked several of us to give\\n them a hand on the same kind of\\n job. The political conditions there\\n were rotten. We went with him.\\n Again we were successful. It seems\\n I have a kind of genius for that\\n sort of thing.”\\n\\n\\n He stretched out his legs and regarded\\n them thoughtfully. “I\\n learned then the truth of Russell’s\\n saying: ‘When the oppressed win\\n their freedom they are as oppressive\\n as their former masters.’ When\\n they went bad, I opposed them.\\n This time I failed. But I escaped\\n again. I have quite a talent for that\\n also.\\n\\n\\n “I’m not a professional do-gooder.”\\n Zarwell’s tone appealed\\n to Bergstrom for understanding. “I\\n have only a normal man’s indignation\\n at injustice. And now I’ve done\\n my share. Yet, wherever I go, the\\n word eventually gets out, and I’m\\n right back in a fight again. It’s like\\n the proverbial monkey on my back.\\n I can’t get rid of it.”\\n\\n\\n He rose. “That disguise and\\n memory planting were supposed to\\n get me out of it. I should have\\n known it wouldn’t work. But this\\n time I’m not going to be drawn\\n back in! You and your Vernon\\n Johnson can do your own revolting.\\n I’m through!”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom did not argue as he\\n left.\\nRESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell\\n from his flat the next day—a\\n legal holiday on St. Martin’s. At\\n a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered\\n in the shadow of an adjacent\\n building watching workmen drilling\\n an excavation for a new structure.\\n\\n\\n When a man strolled to his side\\n and stood watching the workmen,\\n he was not surprised. He waited for\\n the other to speak.\\n\\n\\n “I’d like to talk to you, if you\\n can spare a few minutes,” the\\n stranger said.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell turned and studied the\\n man without answering. He was\\n medium tall, with the body of an\\n athlete, though perhaps ten years\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 147\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n beyond the age of sports. He had\\n a manner of contained energy.\\n “You’re Johnson?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n The man nodded.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell tried to feel the anger he\\n wanted to feel, but somehow it\\n would not come. “We have nothing\\n to talk about,” was the best he\\n could manage.\\n\\n\\n “Then will you just listen? After,\\n I’ll leave—if you tell me to.”\\n\\n\\n Against his will he found himself\\n liking the man, and wanting at least\\n to be courteous. He inclined his\\n head toward a curb wastebox with\\n a flat top. “Should we sit?”\\n\\n\\n Johnson smiled agreeably and\\n they walked over to the box and\\n sat down.\\n\\n\\n “When this colony was first\\n founded,” Johnson began without\\n preamble, “the administrative body\\n was a governor, and a council of\\n twelve. Their successors were to\\n be elected biennially. At first they\\n were. Then things changed. We\\n haven’t had an election now in the\\n last twenty-three years. St. Martin’s\\n is beginning to prosper. Yet\\n the only ones receiving the benefits\\n are the rulers. The citizens work\\n twelve hours a day. They are poorly\\n housed\\n , poorly fed, poorly clothed.\\n They\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell found himself not listening\\n as Johnson’s voice went on. The\\n story was always the same. But why\\n did they always try to drag him into\\n their troubles?\\n\\n\\n Why hadn’t he chosen some\\n other world on which to hide?\\n\\n\\n The last question prompted a\\n new thought. Just why had he\\n chosen St. Martin’s? Was it only a\\n coincidence? Or had he,\\n subconsciously\\n at least, picked this particular\\n world? He had always\\n considered himself the unwilling\\n subject of glib persuaders … but\\n mightn’t some inner compulsion of\\n his own have put the monkey on his\\n back?\\n\\n\\n “…\\xa0and we need your help.”\\n Johnson had finished his speech.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell gazed up at the bright\\n sky. He pulled in a long breath,\\n and let it out in a sigh.\\n\\n\\n “What are your plans so far?”\\n he asked wearily.\\n—\\nCHARLES V. DE VET\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Interstellar was new and they wanted him on the ship\\n because he was a trained observer. They wanted facts, not gibberish.\\n But to ask a man to give up two years of his life—well, that was\\n asking a lot. Two years in a sardine can. Still, it had an appeal Keith\\n Ellason knew he couldn\\'t deny, a newsman\\'s joy of the clean beat, a\\n planetary system far afield, a closeup view of the universe, history in\\n the making.\\n\\n\\n Interstellar Chief Rexroad knocked the dottle from his pipe in a tray,\\n saying, \"Transworld Press is willing to let you have a leave of\\n abscence, if you\\'re interested.\"\\n\\n\\n He knew Secretary Phipps from years of contacting, and now Phipps said,\\n \"Personally, I don\\'t want to see anybody else on the job. You\\'ve got a\\n fine record in this sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\\n Keith Ellason smiled, but just barely. \"You should have called me for\\n the first trip.\"\\n\\n\\n Phipps nodded. \"I wish we had had you on the\\nWeblor I\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Crewmen,\" Rexroad said, \"make poor reporters.\"\\n\\n\\n The\\nWeblor I\\nhad taken off on the first trip to Antheon five years\\n before with a thousand families, reached the planet with less than five\\n hundred surviving colonists. Upon the return to Earth a year later, the\\n crew\\'s report of suffering and chaos during the year\\'s outgoing voyage\\n was twisted, distorted and fragmentary. Ellason remembered it well. The\\n decision of Interstellar was that the colonists started a revolution\\n far out in space, that it was fanned by the ignorance of Captain\\n Sessions in dealing with such matters.\\n\\n\\n \"Space affects men in a peculiar way,\" Phipps said. \"We have conquered\\n the problem of small groups in space—witness the discovery of\\n Antheon, for example—but when there are large groups, control is more\\n difficult.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sessions,\" Rexroad said, \"was a bully. The trouble started at about\\n the halfway point. It ended with passengers engaging in open warfare\\n with each other and the crew. Sessions was lucky to escape with his\\n life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"As I recall,\" Ellason said, \"there was something about stunners.\"\\n\\n\\n Phipps rubbed his chin. \"No weapons were allowed on the ship, but you\\n must remember the colonists were selected for their intelligence and\\n resourcefulness. They utilized these attributes to set up weapon shops\\n to arm themselves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The second trip is history,\" Rexroad said. \"And a puzzle.\"\\nEllason nodded. \"The ship disappeared.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes. We gave control to the colonists.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Assuming no accident in space,\" Phipps said, \"it was a wrong decision.\\n They probably took over the ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And now,\" Ellason said, \"you\\'re going to try again.\"\\n\\n\\n Rexroad said very gravely, \"We\\'ve got the finest captain in\\n Interplanetary. Harvey Branson. No doubt you\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s\\n spent his life in our own system, and he\\'s handpicking his own crew. We\\n have also raised prerequisites for applicants. We don\\'t think anything\\n is going to happen, but if it does, we want to get an impersonal,\\n unprejudiced view. That\\'s where you come in. You do the observing, the\\n reporting. We\\'ll evaluate it on your return.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If I return,\" said Ellason.\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose that\\'s problematical,\" Phipps said, \"but I think you will.\\n Captain Branson and his fifty crewmen want to return as badly as you\\n do.\" He grinned. \"You can write that novel you\\'re always talking about\\n on your return trip on the\\nWeblor II\\n.\"\\nBeing a Nilly is important, probably as important as running the ship,\\n and I think it is this thought that keeps us satisfied, willing to be\\n what we are.\\nThe\\nWeblor II\\nhad been built in space, as had its predecessor, the\\nWeblor I\\n, at a tremendous cost. Basically, it was an instrument\\n which would open distant vistas to colonization, reducing the\\n shoulder-to-shoulder pressure of a crowded solar system. A gigantic,\\n hollow spike, the ship would never land anywhere, but would circle\\n Antheon as it circled Earth, shuttling its cargo and passengers to the\\n promised land, the new frontier. A space-borne metropolis, it would\\n be the home for three thousand persons outward bound, only the crew\\n on the return trip. It was equipped with every conceivable facility\\n and comfort—dining rooms, assembly hall, individual and family\\n compartments, recreation areas, swimming pool, library, theater.\\n Nothing had been overlooked.\\n\\n\\n The captain\\'s briefing room was crowded, the air was heavy with the\\n breathing of so many men, and the ventilators could not quite clear the\\n air of tobacco smoke that drifted aimlessly here and there before it\\n was caught and whisked away.\\n\\n\\n In the tradition of newspaperman and observer, Keith Ellason tried\\n to be as inconspicuous as possible, pressing against a bulkhead, but\\n Captain Branson\\'s eyes sought his several times as Branson listened\\n to final reports from his engineers, record keepers, fuel men,\\n computermen, and all the rest. He grunted his approval or disapproval,\\n made a suggestion here, a restriction there. There was no doubt that\\n Branson was in charge, yet there was a human quality about him that\\n Ellason liked. The captain\\'s was a lean face, well tanned, and his eyes\\n were chunks of blue.\\n\\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" Branson said at last, as Ellason knew he would, \"I want\\n to introduce Keith Ellason, whose presence Interstellar has impressed\\n upon us. On loan from Transworld, he will have an observer status.\" He\\n introduced him to the others. All of them seemed friendly; Ellason\\n thought it was a good staff.\\n\\n\\n Branson detained him after the others had gone. \"One thing, Mr.\\n Ellason. To make it easier for you, I suggest you think of this journey\\n strictly from the observer viewpoint. There will be no story for\\n Transworld at the end.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason was startled. While he had considered the possibility, he had\\n not dwelt on it. Now it loomed large in his mind. \"I don\\'t understand,\\n Captain Branson. It seems to me—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me put it differently. Let me say that you will not understand why\\n I say that until the journey ends.\" He smiled. \"Perhaps I shouldn\\'t\\n have mentioned it.\"\\nEllason left the captain\\'s quarters with an odd taste in his mouth. Now\\n why had Branson said that? Why hadn\\'t Rexroad or Phipps said something,\\n if it was important?\\n\\n\\n He made himself comfortable in his seven-foot-by-seven-foot cubicle,\\n which is to say he dropped on his bed, found it more comfortable than\\n he thought it would be, put his arms behind his head, stared at the\\n ceiling. Metal walls, no windows, one floor vent, one ceiling vent,\\n and a solitary ceiling molding tube-light. This would be his home for\\n a year, just as there were homes like it for three thousand others,\\n except that the family rooms would be larger. His quarters were near\\n the front of the spike near the officers\\' quarters.\\n\\n\\n He felt rather than heard the dull rumble. It was a sound he knew would\\n be with him for two years—one year going and one year returning.\\n\\n\\n He looked at his watch, picked up his notebook and made an entry. The\\n ship right now would be slipping ever so slowly away from Earth. He got\\n up. He\\'d have to go forward to the observation dome to see that. Last\\n view of Earth for two years.\\nThe penetration of space by large groups is the coming out from under\\n the traditions of thousands of years, and as these planet-orginated\\n rules fall away, the floundering group seeks a new control, for they\\n are humanity adrift, rudderless, for whom the stars are no longer\\n bearings but nonexistent things, and values are altered if they are not\\n shown the way.\\nThe theft of Carver Janssen\\'s attache case occurred on the thirty-first\\n day out. In Ellason\\'s mind the incident, though insignificant from the\\n standpoint of the ship as a whole, could very well be the cause of\\n dissension later on. His notes covering it were therefore very thorough.\\n\\n\\n Janssen\\'s case contained vegetable and flower seeds—thousands of\\n them, according to the Captain\\'s Bulletin, the ship\\'s daily newsletter\\n which went to all hands and passengers. In the Bulletin the captain\\n appealed to the thief to return the case to Mr. Janssen. He said it\\n was significant that all en route had passed stability tests, and that\\n it was to the ship\\'s discredit that someone with criminal tendencies\\n should have been permitted aboard.\\n\\n\\n Ellason had to smile at that. What did Captain Branson think of those\\n colonists who killed each other on the\\nWeblor I\\n? They had passed\\n stability tests too. This, then, was what happened when you took three\\n thousand strangers and stuck them in a can for a year.\\nWhen Ellason saw Branson about it, the captain said, \"Of course I\\n realize it takes only a little thing like this to set things off. I\\n know people get tired of seeing each other, playing the same tapes,\\n looking at the stars from the observation dome, walking down the same\\n corridors, reading the same books, eating the same meals, though God\\n knows we try to vary it as much as we can. Space creates rough edges.\\n But the point is, we know all this, and knowing it, we shouldn\\'t let it\\n happen. We\\'ve got to find that thief.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What would he want seeds for? Have you thought of that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course. They\\'d have real value on Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason sought out Carver Janssen. He was a middle-aged man with a\\n tired face and sad eyes. He said, \"Now what am I going to Antheon\\n for? I could only take along so much baggage and I threw out some\\n comfort items to make room for the seeds. I\\'m a horticulturist, and\\n Interstellar asked me to go along. But what use am I now? Where am\\n I going to get seeds like those? Do you know how long it took me to\\n collect them? They\\'re not ordinary seeds, Mr. Ellason.\"\\n\\n\\n There was an appeal from Janssen in the next day\\'s newsletter\\n describing the seeds, telling of their value, and requesting their\\n return in the interests of the Antheon colony and of humanity.\\n\\n\\n On the thirty-fourth day a witness turned up who said he had seen a\\n man emerging from Janssen\\'s compartment with the black case. \"I didn\\'t\\n think anything of it at the time,\" Jamieson Dievers said.\\n\\n\\n Branson asked him to describe the man.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, he was about six feet tall, stocky build, and he wore a red rubber\\n mask that covered his head completely.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Didn\\'t you think that was important?\" Branson asked in an outraged\\n voice. \"A man wearing a red mask?\"\\n\\n\\n Dievers shrugged. \"This is a spaceship. How would I know whether a red\\n mask—or a blue or green one—does or doesn\\'t belong on a spaceship?\"\\n\\n\\n Although Dievers\\' account appeared in the newsletter, it was largely\\n discounted.\\n\\n\\n \"If it is true,\" Branson told Ellason, \"the theft must be the work of\\n a psychotic. But I don\\'t believe Jamieson Dievers. It may well be he\\'s\\n the psychotic.\" He snorted. \"Red rubber mask! I think I\\'ll have Dievers\\n put through psychiatry.\"\\n\\n\\n Attendant to taking notes on this incident, Ellason noted a strange\\n thing. Janssen lived in that part of the ship known as the First\\n Quadrant, and those who lived in that quadrant—more than seven hundred\\n men, women and children—felt that the thief must surely live in\\n Quadrant Two or Four. Elias Cromley, who had the compartment next to\\n Janssen\\'s, sounded the consensus when he said, \"Surely a man wouldn\\'t\\n steal from his own quadrant, now would he, Mr. Ellason?\"\\n\\n\\n And so, Ellason observed in his notebook, are wars created.\\nSeen in space, stars are unmoving, silent, sterile bright eyes ever\\n watchful and accusing. To men unused to it, such a sight numbs,\\n compresses, stultifies. He introduces a countermeasure, proof he\\n exists, which is any overt act, sometimes violent.\\nOn the forty-fifth day June Failright, the young wife of one of the\\n passenger meteorologists, ran screaming down one of the long corridors\\n of the Third Quadrant. She told the captain she had been attacked in\\n her compartment while her husband was in the ship\\'s library. She was\\n taken to one of the ship\\'s doctors, who confirmed it.\\n\\n\\n She said the culprit was a husky man wearing a red rubber mask, and\\n though her description of what he had done did not appear in the story\\n in the newsletter, it lost no time in penetrating every compartment of\\n the ship.\\n\\n\\n Ellason was present when a delegation from the Third Quadrant called on\\n Captain Branson, demanding action.\\n\\n\\n Branson remained seated behind his desk, unperturbed, saying, \"I have\\n no crewmen to spare for police duty.\"\\n\\n\\n The delegation commenced speaking vehemently, to be quieted by\\n Branson\\'s raised hand.\\n\\n\\n \"I sympathize,\" Branson said, \"but it is up to each quadrant to deal\\n with its problems, whatever they may be. My job is to get us to\\n Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n The group left in a surly mood.\\n\\n\\n \"You wonder at my reluctance, Mr. Ellason,\" Captain Branson said. \"But\\n suppose I assign the crew to patrol duties, the culprit isn\\'t caught,\\n and further incidents occur. What then? It soon becomes the crew\\'s\\n fault. And soon the colonists will begin thinking these things might be\\n the crew\\'s doing in the first place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Ellason said, \"but what if the intruder is a crewman?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know my men,\" Branson said flatly.\\n\\n\\n \"You could have a shake-down for the mask and the seed case.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you think it is a member of the crew?\" Branson\\'s eyes were bright.\\n \"No, I trust my men. I won\\'t violate that trust.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason left, feeling uneasy. If he were Branson, he\\'d initiate an\\n investigation, if nothing else than to prove the crew guiltless. Why\\n couldn\\'t Branson see the wisdom of setting an example for the colonists?\\nAs a Nilly, I knew that space breeds hate. There is a seed of\\n malevolence in every man. It sometimes blossoms out among the stars. On\\n the\\nWeblor II\\nit was ready for ripening.\\nRaymond Palugger was killed in the ship\\'s hospital on the sixty-first\\n day. Palugger, a Fourth Quadrant passenger, had complained of feeling\\n ill, had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of ileus. He had put his\\n money belt in the drawer of the small stand beside his bed. A man\\n in a red mask was seen hurrying from the hospital area, and a staff\\n investigation revealed that Palugger had died trying to prevent the\\n theft of the belt.\\n\\n\\n Captain Branson did not wait for the newsletter. Through the ship\\'s\\n speaker system, he reported that Palugger had a fortune in credits\\n in the belt and had died of a severe beating. He said that since the\\n incident occurred in the staff section of the ship, his crew would be\\n forced to submit to a thorough inspection in an effort to find the\\n mask, the seed case, the money and the man.\\n\\n\\n \"I will not countenance such an act by a crewman,\" Branson said. \"If\\n and when he is found, he will be severely dealt with. But he might not\\n be a member of the crew. I am ordering an assembly of all passengers at\\n nine tomorrow morning in the auditorium. I will speak to you all then.\"\\nFaces were angry, tongues were sharp at the meeting, eyes suspicious\\n and tempers short. Above it all was the overpowering presence of\\n Captain Branson speaking to them.\\n\\n\\n \"It is not my desire to interfere in passenger affairs,\" he said.\\n \"Insofar as the ship is concerned, it is my duty to make certain no\\n crewman is guilty. This I am doing. But my crew is not and cannot be\\n a police force for you. It is up to you people to police and protect\\n yourselves.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How can we protect ourselves without stunners?\" one colonist called\\n out.\\n\\n\\n \"Has Red Mask a gun?\" Branson retorted. \"It seems to me you have a\\n better weapon than any gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"This ship is only so wide, so long and so deep. If every inch is\\n searched, you\\'ll find your man. He has to be somewhere aboard.\"\\n\\n\\n The colonists quieted. Benjamin Simpson, one of the older men, was\\n elected president of the newly formed Quadrant Council. One man from\\n each of the quadrants was named to serve under him. Each of these men\\n in turn selected five others from his own group.\\n\\n\\n Those assembled waited in the hall while each team of six inspected\\n the compartments of the others. These compartments were then locked,\\n everyone returned to his compartment, and the larger search was\\n conducted. It took twenty hours.\\n\\n\\n No mask was found. No mask, no case, no money, no man.\\n\\n\\n The captain reported that his search had been equally fruitless.\\n At another assembly the following day it was decided to make the\\n inspection teams permanent, to await further moves on the part of Red\\n Mask. The Quadrant Council held periodic meetings to set up a method of\\n trial for him when he was caught. It was all recorded in the newsletter\\n and by Keith Ellason.\\nWe Nillys know about hate and about violence. We know too that where\\n there is hate there is violence, and where there is violence there is\\n death.\\nDuring sleep time on the seventy-ninth day Barbara Stoneman, awakened\\n by a strange sound, sat up in the bed of her compartment to find a\\n man in a red mask in her room. Her cries brought neighbors into the\\n corridor. The flight of the man was witnessed by many, and several men\\n tried to stop him. But the intruder was light on his feet and fast. He\\n escaped.\\n\\n\\n The Quadrant Council confronted the captain, demanding weapons.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you out of your minds?\" Branson exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n Tom Tilbury, Fourth Quadrant leader, said, \"We want to set up a police\\n force, Captain. We want stunners.\"\\n\\n\\n \"There\\'s no law against it,\" Branson said, \"but it\\'s a rule of mine\\n that no weapons are to be issued en route.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If we had had a gun, we\\'d have got Red Mask,\" Tilbury said.\\n\\n\\n \"And I might have a murder on my conscience.\"\\n\\n\\n Tilbury said, \"We\\'ve also thought of that. Suppose you supply us with\\n half-power stunners? That way we can stun but not kill.\"\\n\\n\\n They got their guns. Now there were twenty-four policemen on duty in\\n the corridors—eight on at a time. Ellason observed that for the first\\n time the passengers seemed relaxed.\\n\\n\\n Let Red Mask move against armed men, they said.\\n\\n\\n Yeah, let him see what happens now.\\n\\n\\n Red Mask did.\\nOn the 101st day he was seen in a corridor in Quadrant Four. Emil\\n Pierce, policeman on duty, managed to squeeze off several shots at his\\n retreating figure.\\n\\n\\n Red Mask was seen again on the 120th day, on the 135th day, and the\\n 157th day. He was seen, shot at, but not hit. He was also unable to\\n commit any crime.\\n\\n\\n We\\'ve got him on the run, the colonists said.\\n\\n\\n He\\'s afraid to do anything, now that we\\'ve got police protection, they\\n said smugly.\\n\\n\\n The Quadrant Council congratulated itself. The passengers were proud\\n of themselves. A special congratulatory message from Captain Branson\\n appeared one day in the Bulletin newsletter.\\n\\n\\n The colonists settled down to living out the rest of the voyage until\\n the landing on Antheon.\\n\\n\\n But on the 170th day calamity struck. Red Mask appropriated one of the\\n stunners, made his way down one whole corridor section in Quadrant Two,\\n put occupants to sleep as he went, taking many articles of value and\\n leaving disorder behind.\\n\\n\\n Ellason interviewed as many victims as he could, noted it all in\\n his book. The things taken were keepsakes, photographs and items of\\n personal value. It seemed to be the work of a madman. If Red Mask\\n wanted to make everyone furious, he certainly succeeded.\\n\\n\\n \"What does he want that stuff for?\" Casey Stromberg, a passenger\\n doctor, asked. \"I can see him taking my narcotics, my doctor\\'s kit—but\\n my dead wife\\'s picture? That I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\\n It was the same with others. \"The man\\'s insane, Mr. Ellason. Positively\\n insane.\" Many people said it.\\n\\n\\n The council issued orders that all passengers from now on would be\\n required to lock their compartments at all times. More guns were\\n obtained from the captain. More policemen were appointed.\\n\\n\\n Ellason was busy noting it all in his book. It became filled with\\n jottings about innocent people being accidentally stunned when\\n trigger-happy policemen thought their movements suspicious, about one\\n man\\'s suspicion of another and the ensuing search of compartments,\\n people who saw Red Mask here, saw him there. Hardly a day went by\\n without some new development.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, Mr. Ellason, we\\'re going to get him,\" said Tilbury, now chief\\n of police, cracking his knuckles, his eyes glowing at the thought.\\n \"We\\'re bound to get him. We\\'ve got things worked out to the finest\\n detail. He won\\'t be able to get through our fingers now. Just let him\\n make so much as a move.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And what will you do when you get him?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Kill him,\" Tilbury said, licking his lips, his eyes glowing more\\n fiercely than ever.\\n\\n\\n \"Without a trial?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, there\\'ll be a trial, Mr. Ellason, but you don\\'t think any jury\\'d\\n let him live after all the things he\\'s done, do you?\"\\nRed Mask was stunned in Quadrant Four in a corridor by a policeman\\n named Terryl Placer on the 201st day. The criminal was carried to the\\n assembly room surrounded by guards, for he surely would have been\\n mauled, if not killed, by angry colonists who crowded around. In the\\n assembly hall his mask was whipped off. The crowd gasped. Nobody knew\\n him.\\n\\n\\n Ellason\\'s first thought was that he must be a stowaway, but then he\\n remembered the face, and Captain Branson, who came to have a look at\\n him, unhappily admitted the man was a member of the crew. His name was\\n Harrel Critten and he was a record keeper third class.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, Critten,\" Branson roared at him, \"what have you got to say for\\n yourself?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go to hell,\" Critten said quietly. As if it were an afterthought, he\\n spat at the captain.\\n\\n\\n Branson looked as if he were going to kill the man himself right there\\n and then.\\n\\n\\n It was a long trial—from the 220th to the 241st day—and there didn\\'t\\n seem to be much doubt about the outcome, for Critten didn\\'t help his\\n own cause during any of it.\\n\\n\\n Lemuel Tarper, who was appointed prosecutor, asked him, \"What did you\\n do with the loot, Critten?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten looked him square in the eye and said, \"I threw it out one of\\n the escape chutes. Does that answer your question?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Threw it away?\" Tarper and the crowd were incredulous.\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Critten said. \"You colonists got the easy life as passengers,\\n just sitting around. I had to work my head off keeping records for you\\n lazy bastards.\"\\n\\n\\n The verdict was, of course, death.\\n\\n\\n They executed Harrel Critten on the morning of the 270th day with\\n blasts from six stunners supplied with full power. It was witnessed\\n by a great crowd in the assembly hall. A detail from the ship\\'s crew\\n disposed of his body through a chute.\\n\\n\\n It was all duly recorded in Keith Ellason\\'s notebooks.\\nDying is easy for a Nilly. Especially if it\\'s arranged for beforehand,\\n which it always is.\\nThe\\nWeblor II\\nwas only one day out of orbit when Captain Branson sent\\n for Ellason and introduced him to the executed man.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello,\" Critten said, grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\\n \"I figured as much,\" Ellason said. \"I\\'ve been doing a lot of thinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re perhaps a little too good as an observer,\" Branson said. \"Or\\n maybe it was because you really weren\\'t one of the colonists. But no\\n matter, Critten did a good job. He was trained by an old friend of mine\\n for this job, Gelthorpe Nill. Nill used to be in counter-espionage when\\n there were wars.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were excellent,\" Ellason said.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t say I enjoyed the role,\" said Critten, \"but I think it saved\\n lives.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Let me get this straight. Interstellar thought that it was idleness\\n and boredom that caused the killings on the\\nWeblor I\\n, so they had you\\n trained to be a scapegoat. Is that right?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten nodded. \"When great numbers are being transported, they are apt\\n to magnify each little event because so little happens. It was my job\\n to see that they directed none of their venom against each other or the\\n crew, only toward me.\"\\n\\n\\n Branson smiled. \"It made the time pass quickly and interestingly for\\n the passengers.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To say nothing of me,\" Critten said.\\n\\n\\n \"And you, Mr. Ellason, were along to observe it all,\" Captain Branson\\n put in. \"Interstellar wanted an accurate picture of this. If it worked,\\n they told me they\\'d use it on other trips to Antheon.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason nodded. \"No time for brooding, for differences of opinion on\\n small matters. Just time to hate Mr. Critten. Unanimously.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Probably,\" Critten said, \"you are wondering about the execution.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Naturally.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We removed the charges before the guns were used.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Carver Janssen\\'s case?\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'ll get it back when he\\'s shuttled to Antheon. And all the other\\n items will be returned. They\\'re all tagged with their owner\\'s names.\\n Captain Branson will say they were found somewhere on the ship. You\\n see, I was a liar.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How about that assault on June Failright?\"\\n\\n\\n Critten grinned again. \"She played right into our hands. She ran out\\n into the hall claiming I\\'d attacked her, which I did not. She was\\n certainly amazed when the ship\\'s physicians agreed with her. Of course\\n Captain Branson told them to do that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the murder?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Raymond Palugger died in the hospital all right, but he died from\\n his illness on the operating table. We turned it into an advantage by\\n making it look suspicious.\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason brightened. \"And by that time everybody was seeing Red Mask\\n everywhere and the colonists organized against him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Gave them something to do,\" Branson said.\\n\\n\\n \"Every time things got dull, I livened them up. I got a stunner and\\n robbed along the corridor. That really stirred them. Lucky nobody got\\n hurt during any of it, including that Stoneman woman. I was trying to\\n rob her when she woke up.\"\\nBranson cleared his throat. \"Ah, Ellason about that story. You\\n understand you can\\'t write it, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n Ellason said regretfully that he did understand.\\n\\n\\n \"The colonists will never know the truth,\" Branson went on. \"There will\\n be other ships outward bound.\"\\n\\n\\n Critten sighed. \"And I\\'ll have to be caught again.\"\\nYes, we\\'re anonymous, nameless, we Nillys, for that\\'s what we call\\n each other, and are a theme, with variations, in the endless stretches\\n of deep space, objects of hatred and contempt, professional heels,\\n dying once a trip when the time is ripe, antidote to boredom, and we\\'ll\\n ply our trade, our little tragedies, on a thousand ships bringing\\n humanity to new worlds.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

It\\'s\\n true that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion\\n can never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a\\n challenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts\\n that a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.\\n\\n\\n In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing\\n seals, for example, the fo\\'c\\'s\\'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,\\n celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The\\n Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into\\n his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age\\n only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen\\n are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the\\nChlorella\\nand\\nScenedesmus\\nalgae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the\\n road to the larger Space without.\\n\\n\\n Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in\\n history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis\\n to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with\\n cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the\\n hundred-and-first chapter of\\nMoby Dick\\n, a book spooled in the\\n amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that\\n no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more\\n than a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of\\n Leyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a\\n man condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.\\n\\n\\n The\\nPequod\\'s\\ncrew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz\\'s men won\\n their war on canned pork and beans. The\\nTriton\\nmade her underwater\\n periplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and\\n concentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the\\n skies, a decline set in.\\n\\n\\n The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent\\n food. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings\\n from aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the\\n groundsman\\'s diet of steak and fried potatoes.\\nLong before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\\n through a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\\n exordium of\\nIsaiah\\n36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\\n what was day-before-yesterday\\'s table-scraps and jakes-water.\\n\\n\\n The Ship\\'s Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\\n offal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\\n spacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\\n Slimeheads remember the H. M. S.\\nAjax\\nfiasco, for example, in which a\\n galleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship\\'s\\n shielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\\n the\\nAjax\\nin deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\\n of the\\nBenjo Maru\\nincident, too, caused by a Ship\\'s Cook who allowed\\n his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\\nSaccharomycodes\\nyeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\\n Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\\n the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\\n bite he ate to a superior grade of\\nsake\\n. And for a third footnote to\\n the ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\\n Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\\nCharles Partlow\\n Sale\\n.\\n\\n\\n The\\nSale\\nblasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\\n in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\\n the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\\n human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\\n seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted\\n in the\\nmaria\\nto squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\\n aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship\\'s\\n Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\\n the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship\\'s Cook was\\n Robert Bailey.\\n\\n\\n Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\\n tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\\n dietetics and sewage engineering. It\\'s the Cook\\'s responsibility to\\n see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\\n water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\\n This isn\\'t just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It\\'s a\\n statement of the least fuel a man can run on.\\n\\n\\n Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\\n compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\\nC. P. Sale\\nno reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\\n work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\\n of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\\n and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\\n protein or mineral that didn\\'t feed the crew fed the algae. And the\\n algae fed us.\\n\\n\\n All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\\n from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\\n and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\\n essential amino acids.\\n\\n\\n The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\\n smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\\n hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\\n wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\\n oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\\n end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\\n glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\\n politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\\n breed apart. We\\'re the one race of men who can\\'t afford the luxury of\\n squeamishness.\\nThough I\\'m signed aboard as Ship\\'s Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\\n in space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\\n extraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\\n guardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\\n Generally the man aboard who\\'d serve as the most popular murder-victim\\n is the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\\n\\n\\n If the Cook hadn\\'t problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\\n of his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\\n was the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\\n so alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\\n done splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\\n was a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\\n Earth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\\n Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\\n Pullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\\n hemorrhoid.\\n\\n\\n The Captain\\'s particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\\n It was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\\n Robert,\" on Ship\\'s Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\\n shipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed\\nhaut\\n cuisine\\nand the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\\n algaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\\n Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship\\'s head by any\\n other name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\\n\\n\\n Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\\n of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by\\n Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\\n and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\\n textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\\n slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\\n For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\\n the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\\n \"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\\n \"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\\n in my home country:\\nMensch ist was er isst.\\nIt means, you are what\\n you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this\\nSchweinerei\\nyou are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\\n with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\\n ladder from the dining-cubby.\\n\"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\\n\\n\\n \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\\n give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother\\'s Day. But we\\'ve got\\n to live with him. He\\'s a good man at driving a ship.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wish he\\'d leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\\n\\n\\n \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\\n said. \"He eats well. We all do. I\\'ve dined aboard a lot of spacers in\\n my time, and I\\'ll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\\n was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\\n is what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\\n its bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\\n we\\'d call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\\n death of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\\n the good work, though, and you\\'ll keep our Captain fat.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\\n from Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\\n waved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I\\'m thinking about\\n tomorrow\\'s menu.\"\\n\\n\\n The product of Bailey\\'s cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\\n next day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\\n with something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\\n burnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\\n guess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\\n drying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\\n heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The\\npièce de\\n résistance\\nwas again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\\n mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\\n faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\\n been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It\\'s\\n so tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it\\'s really\\n steak.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\\n imploring the Captain\\'s ratification of his masterpiece. The big\\n man\\'s pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\\n \"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\\n this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\\n cycler-salt.\"\\n\"You seem able enough to choke down Bailey\\'s chow, Captain,\" I said. I\\n gazed at Winkelmann\\'s form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I eat it,\" the Captain said, taking and talking through another\\n bite. \"But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and\\n grasshoppers, to stay alive.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sir, what in heaven\\'s name do you expect from me?\" Bailey pleaded.\\n\\n\\n \"Only good food,\" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised\\n algae. He tapped his head with a finger. \"This—the brain that guides\\n the ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,\\n Belly-Robber?\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. \"Yes, sir. But I really\\n don\\'t know what I can do to please you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You are a spacer and a Ship\\'s Cook, not a suburban\\nHausfrau\\nwith the\\n vapors,\" Winkelmann said. \"I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums\\n or weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will\\n keep my belly content and my brain alive.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British\\n term Dumb Insolence.\\n\\n\\n Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I\\n followed him. \"Captain,\" I said, \"you\\'re driving Bailey too hard.\\n You\\'re asking him to make bricks without straw.\"\\n\\n\\n Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. \"You think, Doctor,\\n that my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged\\n man?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Frankly, I can\\'t understand your attitude at all,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,\"\\n Winkelmann said. \"Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the\\n Pharaoh\\'s taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of\\n Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the\\n mother of invention. I am Bailey\\'s necessity. My unkindnesses make him\\n uncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,\\n to improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn\\n somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re driving him too hard, Sir,\" I said. \"He\\'ll crack.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars\\' salary waiting when we\\n ground at Brady Station,\" Captain Winkelmann said. \"So much money buys\\n many discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Crew morale on the ship....\" I began.\\n\\n\\n \"That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,\" Captain Winkelmann repeated.\\nBailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\\n path to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\\n the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\\n by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\\n mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann\\'s orders. \"Convey my\\n compliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\\n the crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\\n cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\\n acidly called in question again.\\n\\n\\n I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\\n into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\\n brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an\\nersatz\\nhot\\n turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\\n turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\\n a grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\\n a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\\n genuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\\n helping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\\n only arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\\n a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\\n edibility. By the time we are halfway \\'round the Sun, I trust you will\\n have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\\n student. That will be all, Bailey.\"\\n\\n\\n The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann\\'s riding of\\n Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\\n Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\\n on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\\n few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\\n memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\\n lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\\n seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\\n and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\\n Captain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\\n that would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\\n Winkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.\\nEach man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects\\n besides his uniforms, these being considered Ship\\'s Furnishing. As\\n his rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this\\n ration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of\\n books, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help\\n him while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a\\n fact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of\\n spices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,\\n and a dozen others.\\n\\n\\n Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards\\n interested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien\\n to his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he\\'d\\n exercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance\\n to the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.\\n To collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come\\n aboard their ship mother-naked.\\n\\n\\n But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects\\n baggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon\\n mess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet\\n on the mysterious box as he sat to eat.\\n\\n\\n \"What disgusting form does the ship\\'s garbage appear in today,\\n Belly-Robber?\" he asked the Cook.\\n\\n\\n Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he\\'d\\n had much practice. \"I\\'ve been working on the problem of steak, Sir,\"\\n he said. \"I think I\\'ve whipped the taste; what was left was to get the\\n texture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Winkelmann growled. \"You intend that your latest mess\\n should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Sir,\" Bailey said. \"Well, I squeezed the\\n steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special\\n seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal\\n oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out.\\nVoila!\\nI had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine\\n meat.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Remarkable, Bailey,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with\\n our food,\" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of\\n distaste. \"It\\'s quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I\\n never cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils\\n the meal.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of\\n the table and tenderly lifted a small \"steak\" onto each of our plates.\\n \"Try it,\" he urged the Captain.\\nCaptain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The\\n color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell\\n of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. \"Not\\n too bad, Belly-Robber,\" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed\\n his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A\\n kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a\\n more reasonable man. \"But it still needs something ... something,\"\\n Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.\\n \"Aha! I have it!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, Sir?\" Bailey asked.\\n\\n\\n \"This, Belly-Robber!\" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and\\n ripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed\\n the cap. \"Ketchup,\" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey\\'s\\n masterpiece. \"The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.\"\\n Lifting a hunk of the \"steak,\" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,\\n Winkelmann chewed. \"Just the thing,\" he smiled.\\n\\n\\n \"Damn you!\" Bailey shouted.\\n\\n\\n Winkelmann\\'s smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.\\n\\n\\n \"... Sir,\" Bailey added.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said\\n meditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have\\n sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a\\n bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.\\n\\n\\n \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat\\n to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic\\n slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of\\n this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I\\'d likely be in\\n no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you\\n understand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\\n \"I understand that you\\'re an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,\\n slave-driving....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are\\n insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Captain, you\\'ve gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was\\n scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship\\'s\\n Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.\\n\\n\\n \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers\\n and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said.\\n \"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added.\\nBailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him\\n to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my\\n bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal\\n bulkhead. \"You\\'ll have that drink now,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"No, dammit!\" he shouted.\\n\\n\\n \"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc\\'s of rye. \"This is\\n therapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat\\n like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.\\n\\n\\n After a few minutes Bailey\\'s sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to\\n be ashamed of.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel\\n and sauerkraut and\\nBackhahndl nach suddeutscher Art\\nout of an algae\\n tank? I\\'ve got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out\\n molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And\\n he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet\\n of the Friends of Escoffier!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You\\'ve worked your\\n fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you\\'re not\\n appreciated. But you\\'re not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year\\n from now you\\'ll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that\\n restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He\\n reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be\\n an apt confederate of\\nvis medicatrix naturae\\n, the healing power of\\n nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it\\n off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he\\'d needed.\\n\\n\\n For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in\\n horribleness, a pottage or boiled\\nChlorella vulgaris\\nthat looked\\n and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,\\n red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as\\n though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the\\n disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you\\'re\\n improving a little at last.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were\\n now strong enough to withstand the Captain\\'s fiercest assaults of\\n irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was\\n a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann\\n theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain\\n had pushed too hard. He\\'d need that ketchup for the meals to come, I\\n thought.\\n\\n\\n Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted\\n of salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were\\n vehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for\\n the decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served\\n the algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley\\n oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.\\nThere being only three seats in the\\nSale\\'s\\nmess compartment, we ate\\n our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\\n supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\\n to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\\n of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\\n of canned beer being church-keyed. \"He\\'s done it, Doc!\" one of the\\n first-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then he\\'s beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\\n\\n\\n \"The Dutchman won\\'t want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\\n said.\\n\\n\\n I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\\n warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\\n us with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\\n Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\\n in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\\n skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\\n a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\\n limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\\n galley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You\\'ve done it, Bailey,\"\\n I said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\\n actually\\ngood\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\\n\\n\\n I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\\n this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\\n you couldn\\'t have done it without him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\\n Bailey asked.\\n\\n\\n \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\\n Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\\n performance out of his Ship\\'s Cook.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\\n He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\\n of the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\\n spearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll\\n have to admit that I do.\"\\n\\n\\n Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\\n plate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You\\n know how it is. Snead\\'s dead, don\\'t you remember?\"\\n\\n\\n Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What\\n were they trying to pull on him? \"The man who isn\\'t Snead is leaving,\"\\n Linton said, describing the scene over Howell\\'s shoulder. \"If that\\'s\\n Snead\\'s brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Howell said, \"I wouldn\\'t do that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Snead came to Greta\\'s funeral. It\\'s the least I could do.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I wouldn\\'t. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks\\n like him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"He\\'s practically running,\" Linton said. \"He almost ran out of the\\n restaurant.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back\\n intimately against Linton\\'s own chair.\\n\\n\\n \"That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?\" the\\n thick man said.\\n\\n\\n \"Couldn\\'t have been him, though,\" Linton answered automatically. \"My\\n friend\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\\n The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw\\n paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded\\n out of the place quickly.\\n\\n\\n Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton\\'s attention. \"Now\\n you\\'ve probably got old Snead into trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Snead\\'s dead,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, well, \\'dead,\\'\" Howell replied.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you say it like that for?\" Linton demanded angrily. \"The\\n man\\'s dead. Plain dead. He\\'s not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein\\n Monster—there\\'s no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You know how it is,\" Howell said.\\n\\n\\n Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,\\n or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on\\n the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he\\n sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had\\n let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had\\n known a genuine affection for her. But it didn\\'t seem he knew about\\n death at all.\\n\\n\\n Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know, mind you,\" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, \"but\\n I suppose he might have been resurrected.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who by?\" Linton asked, thinking:\\nGod?\\n\"The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to\\n life?\" Linton said.\\nHe knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that\\n some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died\\n in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so\\n patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to\\n the surface immediately.\\n\\n\\n \"An invention? I guess that\\'s how it is,\" Howell agreed. \"I don\\'t know\\n much about people like that. I\\'m an honest businessman.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But it\\'s wonderful,\" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.\\n \"Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don\\'t I know\\n about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sh-h,\" Howell said uneasily. \"This is a public place.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t understand,\" Linton said helplessly.\\n\\n\\n \"Look, Frank, you can\\'t legalize a thing like resurrection,\" Howell\\n said with feigned patience. \"There are strong religious convictions to\\n consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I\\'ve heard they got spies right\\n in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is\\n their whole life. You got to realize that.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s not enough. Not nearly enough.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.\\n Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They\\'d have to take\\n it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\\n\\n \"But what do they do about it? Against it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When\\n the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment\\n and arrest everybody in sight. That\\'s about all they can do. The\\n charges, if any, come under general vice classification.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t understand,\" Linton complained. \"Why haven\\'t I heard about it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"They didn\\'t talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read\\n an article in\\nTime\\nthe other day that said \\'death\\' was our dirty\\n word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, \\'You\\'re going\\n to be dead someday,\\' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The\\n opposite of \\'live\\' these days is \\'video-taped.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" Linton said.\\n\\n\\n He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been\\n out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be\\n trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.\\n But the temptation was too strong.\\n\\n\\n \"Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?\"\\n\\n\\n Howell looked away. \"Frank, I don\\'t have anything to do with that kind\\n of people and if you\\'re smart, you\\'ll not either.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton\\'s fingers imprinted the linen. \"Damn you, Howell, you tell me!\"\\n\\n\\n Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. \"I take you out to dinner to\\n console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make\\n you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the\\n hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you\\n yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!\"\\n\\n\\n Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as\\n the thick-set man and stalked out.\\n\\n\\n I\\'ve got to hurry too, Linton thought. It\\'s Resurrection Day!\\nThe doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. \"Well,\\n well, Mr. Linton, we understand you\\'ve been causing disturbances.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not really,\" Linton said modestly.\\n\\n\\n \"Come, come,\" the doctor chided. \"You started riots in two places,\\n attempted to bribe an officer. That\\'s disturbing, Mr. Linton, very\\n disturbing.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was only trying to find out something,\" Linton maintained. \"They\\n could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor clucked his tongue. \"Let\\'s not think any such thing. People\\n don\\'t know more than you do.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton rubbed his shoulder. \"That cop knew more about Judo holds than I\\n did.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A few specific people know a few specific things you don\\'t. But let me\\n ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein\\'s time asking him a\\n thing like that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You\\n can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person\\n at the right time.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton stared suspiciously. \"Do you know where I can find a\\n resurrectionist?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I am a resurrectionist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the policeman brought me to you!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, that\\'s what you paid him to do, wasn\\'t it? Did you think a\\n policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are\\n cynics.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really\\n looked at the doctor for the first time.\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, can you\\nreally\\nresurrect the dead?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor, I\\'m beginning to believe in you,\" Linton said, \"but tell me,\\n can you resurrect the\\nlong\\ndead?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Size has nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Months?\" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. \"It\\n could be years. Centuries. It\\'s all mathematics, my boy. I need only\\n one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest\\n of it was like and recreate it. It\\'s infallible. Naturally there is a\\n degree of risk involved.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Infallible risk, yes,\" Linton murmured. \"Could you go to work right\\n away?\"\\n\\n\\n \"First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.\"\\n\\n\\n Linton grasped the situation immediately. \"You mean you want money. You\\n realize I\\'ve just got out of an institution....\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics\\n addiction and more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What a wonderful professional career,\" Linton said, when he couldn\\'t\\n care less.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn\\'t come out broke.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Neither did I,\" Linton said hastily. \"I invested in shifty stocks,\\n faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then—\"\\n\\n\\n \"When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn\\'t found you, I\\n would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"All that\\'s ended now,\" the doctor assured him. \"Now we must go dig up\\n the corpse. The female corpse, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n Resurrection Day!\\n\\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Linton whispered, \"my mind is singing with battalions of\\n choirs. I hope that doesn\\'t sound irreverent to you.\"\\n\\n\\n The doctor stroked his oily palms together. \"Oh, but it does.\\n Beautifully.\"\\nThe certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn\\'t been impossible\\n to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton\\'s fortune and fed\\n them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,\\n smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.\\n\\n\\n Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the\\n olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor\\'s inner-inner\\n sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to\\n prepare himself.\\n\\n\\n Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her\\n body. \"Darling!\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Greta!\" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No\\n doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same\\n way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing\\n her ears the way she enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.\\n She kissed his cheek. \"It\\'s so wonderful to be back. This calls for a\\n celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. \"But tell\\n me—how was it being\\naway\\n?\"\\n\\n\\n The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his\\n Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t remember,\" she said. \"I can\\'t really remember anything. Not\\n really. My memories are ghosts....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Now, now,\" Linton said, \"we mustn\\'t get excited. You\\'ve been through a\\n trial.\"\\n\\n\\n She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It\\n was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of\\n course it would be; it hadn\\'t changed even in the grave. He remembered\\n the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.\\n\\n\\n \"I must see all our old friends,\" Greta persisted. \"Helen and\\n Johnny....\"\\n\\n\\n \"My darling,\" he said gently, \"about Johnny—\"\\n\\n\\n Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. \"Yes? What about Johnny?\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months\\n ago. He was killed.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Killed?\" Greta repeated blankly. \"Johnny Gorman was killed?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Traffic accident. Killed instantly.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn\\'t you have him\\n resurrected the same way you did me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You\\n have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer\\n have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.\"\\n\\n\\n Greta turned her back to him. \"It\\'s just as well. You shouldn\\'t bring\\n back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the\\n photograph of a soul. It\\'s monstrous. No one should do that. No one.\\n But you\\'re\\nsure\\nyou haven\\'t the money to do it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Linton said. \"I\\'m sold out. I\\'ve borrowed on my insurance to the\\n hilt. It won\\'t pay any more until I\\'m buried, and then, of course, you\\n can resurrect me.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Greta said. She sighed. \"Poor Johnny. He was such a good\\n friend of yours. You must miss him. I\\'m so sorry for you.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I have you,\" he said with great simplicity.\\n\\n\\n \"Frank,\" she said, \"you should see that place in there. There are\\n foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals\\n to quench death and smother decay. It\\'s\\nperfect\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It sounds carnal,\" he said uneasily.\\n\\n\\n \"No, dear, it\\'s perfect for some things that have to be done.\"\\n\\n\\n Her eyes flashed around the doctor\\'s office and settled somewhere, on\\n something.\\n\\n\\n Linton followed the direction of Greta\\'s gaze and found only an ashtray\\n stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic\\'s idol to a heathen religion on a\\n pedestal.\\n\\n\\n Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him\\n with it over her head.\\n\\n\\n Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.\\n\\n\\n Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.\\nGreta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She\\n writhed against him provocatively. \"Frank, I\\'m sorry, dear, but I have\\n to have that insurance money. It\\'s hell!\"\\n\\n\\n Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that\\n money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles\\n green. No one must ever know.\\n\\n\\n Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face\\n in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and\\n acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.\\n\\n\\n He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.\\n\\n\\n Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and\\n those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in\\n institutional advertising.\\n\\n\\n He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering\\n wreckage.\\n\\n\\n Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat\\n in resurrection. They couldn\\'t chemically revive the old corpse like\\n pouring water on a wilted geranium.\\n\\n\\n Or—\\n\\n\\n Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for\\n if the bodies were used? Didn\\'t the resurrectionists just destroy the\\n old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?\\n\\n\\n But it didn\\'t matter. Not a bit.\\n\\n\\n She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the\\n finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.\\n\\n\\n It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way\\n around.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ve killed my wife!\" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching\\n his hands out to something.\\n\\n\\n The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left\\n a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to\\n follow the camel in his turn.\\nHe opened his eyes to the doctor\\'s spotless, well-ordered office. The\\n doctor looked down at him consolingly. \"You\\'ll have to go back, Mr.\\n Linton. But they\\'ll cure you. You\\'ll be cured of ever thinking your\\n wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you\\nreally\\nthink so, Doctor?\" Linton asked hopefully.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But they had to run head-on against a mad\\n genius who had a motto:\\nDeath to all Terrans!\\n\"Let\\'s\\n keep moving,\" I told\\n Val. \"The surest way to\\n die out here on Mars is to\\n give up.\" I reached over and\\n turned up the pressure on her\\n oxymask to make things a\\n little easier for her. Through\\n the glassite of the mask, I\\n could see her face contorted\\n in an agony of fatigue.\\n\\n\\n And she probably thought\\n the failure of the sandcat was\\n all my fault, too. Val\\'s usually\\n about the best wife a guy\\n could ask for, but when she\\n wants to be she can be a real\\n flying bother.\\n\\n\\n It was beyond her to see\\n that some grease monkey back\\n at the Dome was at fault—whoever\\n it was who had failed\\n to fasten down the engine\\n hood. Nothing but what had\\n stopped us\\ncould\\nstop a sandcat:\\n sand in the delicate\\n mechanism of the atomic engine.\\n\\n\\n But no; she blamed it all on\\n me somehow: So we were out\\n walking on the spongy sand\\n of the Martian desert. We\\'d\\n been walking a good eight\\n hours.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t we turn back now,\\n Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe\\n there isn\\'t any uranium in\\n this sector at all. I think\\n we\\'re crazy to keep on searching\\n out here!\"\\n\\n\\n I started to tell her that the\\n UranCo chief had assured me\\n we\\'d hit something out this\\n way, but changed my mind.\\n When Val\\'s tired and overwrought\\n there\\'s no sense in\\n arguing with her.\\n\\n\\n I stared ahead at the bleak,\\n desolate wastes of the Martian\\n landscape. Behind us\\n somewhere was the comfort\\n of the Dome, ahead nothing\\n but the mazes and gullies of\\n this dead world.\\nHe was a cripple in a wheelchair—helpless as a rattlesnake.\\n\"Try to keep going, Val.\"\\n My gloved hand reached out\\n and clumsily enfolded hers.\\n \"Come on, kid. Remember—we\\'re\\n doing this for Earth.\\n We\\'re heroes.\"\\n\\n\\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,\\n hell!\" she muttered. \"That\\'s\\n the way it looked back home,\\n but, out there it doesn\\'t seem\\n so glorious. And UranCo\\'s\\n pay is stinking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We didn\\'t come out here\\n for the pay, Val.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know, I know, but just\\n the same—\"\\n\\n\\n It must have been hell for\\n her. We had wandered fruitlessly\\n over the red sands all\\n day, both of us listening for\\n the clicks of the counter. And\\n the geigers had been obstinately\\n hushed all day, except\\n for their constant undercurrent\\n of meaningless noises.\\n\\n\\n Even though the Martian\\n gravity was only a fraction of\\n Earth\\'s, I was starting to\\n tire, and I knew it must have\\n been really rough on Val with\\n her lovely but unrugged legs.\\n\\n\\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.\\n \"We\\'re not heroes—we\\'re\\n suckers! Why did I ever let\\n you volunteer for the Geig\\n Corps and drag me along?\"\\n\\n\\n Which wasn\\'t anywhere\\n close to the truth. Now I\\n knew she was at the breaking\\n point, because Val didn\\'t lie\\n unless she was so exhausted\\n she didn\\'t know what she was\\n doing. She had been just as\\n much inflamed by the idea of\\n coming to Mars to help in the\\n search for uranium as I was.\\n We knew the pay was poor,\\n but we had felt it a sort of\\n obligation, something we\\n could do as individuals to\\n keep the industries of radioactives-starved\\n Earth going.\\n And we\\'d always had a roving\\n foot, both of us.\\n\\n\\n No, we had decided together\\n to come to Mars—the\\n way we decided together on\\n everything. Now she was\\n turning against me.\\nI tried to jolly her. \"Buck\\n up, kid,\" I said. I didn\\'t dare\\n turn up her oxy pressure any\\n higher, but it was obvious she\\n couldn\\'t keep going. She was\\n almost sleep-walking now.\\n\\n\\n We pressed on over the\\n barren terrain. The geiger\\n kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,\\n but never broke into\\n that sudden explosive tumult\\n that meant we had found pay-dirt.\\n I started to feel tired\\n myself, terribly tired. I longed\\n to lie down on the soft,\\n spongy Martian sand and\\n bury myself.\\n\\n\\n I looked at Val. She was\\n dragging along with her eyes\\n half-shut. I felt almost guilty\\n for having dragged her out to\\n Mars, until I recalled that I\\n hadn\\'t. In fact, she had come\\n up with the idea before I did.\\n I wished there was some way\\n of turning the weary, bedraggled\\n girl at my side back into\\n the Val who had so enthusiastically\\n suggested we join\\n the Geigs.\\n\\n\\n Twelve steps later, I decided\\n this was about as far as\\n we could go.\\n\\n\\n I stopped, slipped out of\\n the geiger harness, and lowered\\n myself ponderously to\\n the ground. \"What\\'samatter,\\n Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.\\n \"Something wrong?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting\\n out a hand and taking hers.\\n \"I think we ought to rest a\\n little before we go any further.\\n It\\'s been a long, hard\\n day.\"\\n\\n\\n It didn\\'t take much to persuade\\n her. She slid down beside\\n me, curled up, and in a\\n moment she was fast asleep,\\n sprawled out on the sands.\\nPoor kid\\n, I thought. Maybe\\n we shouldn\\'t have come to\\n Mars after all. But, I reminded\\n myself,\\nsomeone\\nhad to do\\n the job.\\n\\n\\n A second thought appeared,\\n but I squelched it:\\n\\n\\n Why the hell me?\\n\\n\\n I looked down at Valerie\\'s\\n sleeping form, and thought of\\n our warm, comfortable little\\n home on Earth. It wasn\\'t\\n much, but people in love don\\'t\\n need very fancy surroundings.\\n\\n\\n I watched her, sleeping\\n peacefully, a wayward lock of\\n her soft blonde hair trailing\\n down over one eyebrow, and\\n it seemed hard to believe that\\n we\\'d exchanged Earth and all\\n it held for us for the raw, untamed\\n struggle that was Mars.\\n But I knew I\\'d do it again, if\\n I had the chance. It\\'s because\\n we wanted to keep what we\\n had. Heroes? Hell, no. We\\n just liked our comforts, and\\n wanted to keep them. Which\\n took a little work.\\nTime to get moving.\\nBut\\n then Val stirred and rolled\\n over in her sleep, and I didn\\'t\\n have the heart to wake her. I\\n sat there, holding her, staring\\n out over the desert, watching\\n the wind whip the sand up\\n into weird shapes.\\n\\n\\n The Geig Corps preferred\\n married couples, working in\\n teams. That\\'s what had finally\\n decided it for us—we were a\\n good team. We had no ties on\\n Earth that couldn\\'t be broken\\n without much difficulty. So\\n we volunteered.\\nAnd here we are.\\nHeroes.\\n The wind blasted a mass of\\n sand into my face, and I felt\\n it tinkle against the oxymask.\\n\\n\\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.\\n Getting late. I decided\\n once again to wake Val.\\n But she was tired. And I was\\n tired too, tired from our\\n wearying journey across the\\n empty desert.\\n\\n\\n I started to shake Val. But\\n I never finished. It would be\\nso\\nnice just to lean back and\\n nuzzle up to her, down in the\\n sand. So nice. I yawned, and\\n stretched back.\\nI awoke with a sudden startled\\n shiver, and realized angrily\\n I had let myself doze off.\\n \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,\\n and started to rise to\\n my feet.\\n\\n\\n I couldn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n I looked down. I was neatly\\n bound in thin, tough, plastic\\n tangle-cord, swathed from\\n chin to boot-bottoms, my\\n arms imprisoned, my feet\\n caught. And tangle-cord is\\n about as easy to get out of as\\n a spider\\'s web is for a trapped\\n fly.\\n\\n\\n It wasn\\'t Martians that\\n had done it. There weren\\'t\\n any Martians, hadn\\'t been for\\n a million years. It was some\\n Earthman who had bound us.\\n\\n\\n I rolled my eyes toward\\n Val, and saw that she was\\n similarly trussed in the sticky\\n stuff. The tangle-cord was still\\n fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant\\n odor like that of drying\\n fish. It had been spun on\\n us only a short time ago, I\\n realized.\\n\\n\\n \"Ron—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t try to move, baby.\\n This stuff can break your\\n neck if you twist it wrong.\"\\n She continued for a moment\\n to struggle futilely, and I had\\n to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\\n\\n\\n \"A very wise statement,\"\\n said a brittle, harsh voice\\n from above me. I looked up\\n and saw a helmeted figure\\n above us. He wasn\\'t wearing\\n the customary skin-tight pliable\\n oxysuits we had. He\\n wore an outmoded, bulky\\n spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,\\n all but the face area\\n opaque. The oxygen cannisters\\n weren\\'t attached to his\\n back as expected, though.\\n They were strapped to the\\n back of the wheelchair in\\n which he sat.\\n\\n\\n Through the fishbowl I\\n could see hard little eyes, a\\n yellowed, parchment-like face,\\n a grim-set jaw. I didn\\'t recognize\\n him, and this struck me\\n odd. I thought I knew everyone\\n on sparsely-settled Mars.\\n Somehow I\\'d missed him.\\n\\n\\n What shocked me most was\\n that he had no legs. The\\n spacesuit ended neatly at the\\n thighs.\\n\\n\\n He was holding in his left\\n hand the tanglegun with\\n which he had entrapped us,\\n and a very efficient-looking\\n blaster was in his right.\\n\\n\\n \"I didn\\'t want to disturb\\n your sleep,\" he said coldly.\\n \"So I\\'ve been waiting here\\n for you to wake up.\"\\n\\n\\n I could just see it. He might\\n have been sitting there for\\n hours, complacently waiting\\n to see how we\\'d wake up.\\n That was when I realized he\\n must be totally insane. I could\\n feel my stomach-muscles\\n tighten, my throat constrict\\n painfully.\\n\\n\\n Then anger ripped through\\n me, washing away the terror.\\n \"What\\'s going on?\" I demanded,\\n staring at the half\\n of a man who confronted us\\n from the wheelchair. \"Who\\n are you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll find out soon\\n enough,\" he said. \"Suppose\\n now you come with me.\" He\\n reached for the tanglegun,\\n flipped the little switch on its\\n side to MELT, and shot a\\n stream of watery fluid over\\n our legs, keeping the blaster\\n trained on us all the while.\\n Our legs were free.\\n\\n\\n \"You may get up now,\" he\\n said. \"Slowly, without trying\\n to make trouble.\" Val and I\\n helped each other to our feet\\n as best we could, considering\\n our arms were still tightly\\n bound against the sides of our\\n oxysuits.\\n\\n\\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,\\n waving the tanglegun to indicate\\n the direction. \"I\\'ll be\\n right behind you.\" He holstered\\n the tanglegun.\\n\\n\\n I glimpsed the bulk of an\\n outboard atomic rigging behind\\n him, strapped to the\\n back of the wheelchair. He\\n fingered a knob on the arm of\\n the chair and the two exhaust\\n ducts behind the wheel-housings\\n flamed for a moment,\\n and the chair began to roll.\\n\\n\\n Obediently, we started\\n walking. You don\\'t argue\\n with a blaster, even if the\\n man pointing it is in a wheelchair.\\n\"What\\'s going on, Ron?\"\\n Val asked in a low voice as we\\n walked. Behind us the wheelchair\\n hissed steadily.\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t quite know, Val.\\n I\\'ve never seen this guy before,\\n and I thought I knew\\n everyone at the Dome.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor\\n called, and we stopped\\n talking. We trudged along together,\\n with him following\\n behind; I could hear the\\ncrunch-crunch\\nof the wheelchair\\n as its wheels chewed\\n into the sand. I wondered\\n where we were going, and\\n why. I wondered why we had\\n ever left Earth.\\n\\n\\n The answer to that came to\\n me quick enough: we had to.\\n Earth needed radioactives,\\n and the only way to get them\\n was to get out and look. The\\n great atomic wars of the late\\n 20th Century had used up\\n much of the supply, but the\\n amount used to blow up half\\n the great cities of the world\\n hardly compared with the\\n amount we needed to put\\n them back together again.\\n\\n\\n In three centuries the shattered\\n world had been completely\\n rebuilt. The wreckage\\n of New York and Shanghai\\n and London and all the other\\n ruined cities had been hidden\\n by a shining new world of\\n gleaming towers and flying\\n roadways. We had profited by\\n our grandparents\\' mistakes.\\n They had used their atomics\\n to make bombs. We used ours\\n for fuel.\\n\\n\\n It was an atomic world.\\n Everything: power drills,\\n printing presses, typewriters,\\n can openers, ocean liners,\\n powered by the inexhaustible\\n energy of the dividing atom.\\n\\n\\n But though the energy is\\n inexhaustible, the supply of\\n nuclei isn\\'t. After three centuries\\n of heavy consumption,\\n the supply failed. The mighty\\n machine that was Earth\\'s industry\\n had started to slow\\n down.\\n\\n\\n And that started the chain\\n of events that led Val and me\\n to end up as a madman\\'s prisoners,\\n on Mars. With every\\n source of uranium mined dry\\n on Earth, we had tried other\\n possibilities. All sorts of\\n schemes came forth. Project\\n Sea-Dredge was trying to get\\n uranium from the oceans. In\\n forty or fifty years, they\\'d\\n get some results, we hoped.\\n But there wasn\\'t forty or\\n fifty years\\' worth of raw stuff\\n to tide us over until then. In a\\n decade or so, our power would\\n be just about gone. I could\\n picture the sort of dog-eat-dog\\n world we\\'d revert back\\n to. Millions of starving, freezing\\n humans tooth-and-clawing\\n in it in the useless shell of\\n a great atomic civilization.\\n\\n\\n So, Mars. There\\'s not much\\n uranium on Mars, and it\\'s not\\n easy to find or any cinch to\\n mine. But what little is there,\\n helps. It\\'s a stopgap effort,\\n just to keep things moving\\n until Project Sea-Dredge\\n starts functioning.\\n\\n\\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers\\n out on the face of\\n Mars, combing for its uranium\\n deposits.\\n\\n\\n And here we are, I thought.\\nAfter we walked on a\\n while, a Dome became visible\\n up ahead. It slid up over the\\n crest of a hill, set back between\\n two hummocks on the\\n desert. Just out of the way\\n enough to escape observation.\\n\\n\\n For a puzzled moment I\\n thought it was our Dome, the\\n settlement where all of UranCo\\'s\\n Geig Corps were located,\\n but another look told me that\\n this was actually quite near\\n us and fairly small. A one-man\\n Dome, of all things!\\n\\n\\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he\\n said. \"The name is Gregory\\n Ledman.\" He herded us off to\\n one side of the airlock, uttered\\n a few words keyed to his\\n voice, and motioned us inside\\n when the door slid up. When\\n we were inside he reached up,\\n clumsily holding the blaster,\\n and unscrewed the ancient\\n spacesuit fishbowl.\\n\\n\\n His face was a bitter,\\n dried-up mask. He was a man\\n who hated.\\n\\n\\n The place was spartanly\\n furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,\\n no decoration of any\\n sort. Hard bulkhead walls,\\n rivet-studded, glared back\\n at us. He had an automatic\\n chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,\\n and no other furniture.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun\\n and sprayed our legs\\n again. We toppled heavily to\\n the floor. I looked up angrily.\\n\"I imagine you want to\\n know the whole story,\" he\\n said. \"The others did, too.\"\\n\\n\\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.\\n Her pretty face was a\\n dead white behind her oxymask.\\n \"What others?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I never bothered to find\\n out their names,\" Ledman\\n said casually. \"They were\\n other Geigs I caught unawares,\\n like you, out on the\\n desert. That\\'s the only sport I\\n have left—Geig-hunting. Look\\n out there.\"\\n\\n\\n He gestured through the\\n translucent skin of the Dome,\\n and I felt sick. There was a\\n little heap of bones lying\\n there, looking oddly bright\\n against the redness of the\\n sands. They were the dried,\\n parched skeletons of Earthmen.\\n Bits of cloth and plastic,\\n once oxymasks and suits, still\\n clung to them.\\n\\n\\n Suddenly I remembered.\\n There had been a pattern\\n there all the time. We didn\\'t\\n much talk about it; we chalked\\n it off as occupational hazards.\\n There had been a pattern\\n of disappearances on the desert.\\n I could think of six, eight\\n names now. None of them\\n had been particularly close\\n friends. You don\\'t get time to\\n make close friends out here.\\n But we\\'d vowed it wouldn\\'t\\n happen to us.\\n\\n\\n It had.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ve been hunting\\n Geigs?\" I asked. \"\\nWhy?\\nWhat\\'ve they ever done to\\n you?\"\\n\\n\\n He smiled, as calmly as if\\n I\\'d just praised his house-keeping.\\n \"Because I hate\\n you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend\\n to wipe every last one of\\n you out, one by one.\"\\n\\n\\n I stared at him. I\\'d never\\n seen a man like this before; I\\n thought all his kind had died\\n at the time of the atomic\\n wars.\\n\\n\\n I heard Val sob, \"He\\'s a\\n madman!\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.\\n \"I\\'m quite sane, believe me.\\n But I\\'m determined to drive\\n the Geigs—and UranCo—off\\n Mars. Eventually I\\'ll scare\\n you all away.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.\\n \"And I have no fears of an\\n armed attack. This place is\\n well fortified. I\\'ve devoted\\n years to building it. And I\\'m\\n back against those hills. They\\n couldn\\'t pry me out.\" He let\\n his pale hand run up into his\\n gnarled hair. \"I\\'ve devoted\\n years to this. Ever since—ever\\n since I landed here on\\n Mars.\"\\n\"What are you going to do\\n with us?\" Val finally asked,\\n after a long silence.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t smile this time.\\n \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not\\n your husband. I want him as\\n an envoy, to go back and tell\\n the others to clear off.\" He\\n rocked back and forth in his\\n wheelchair, toying with the\\n gleaming, deadly blaster in\\n his hand.\\n\\n\\n We stared in horror. It was\\n a nightmare—sitting there,\\n placidly rocking back and\\n forth, a nightmare.\\n\\n\\n I found myself fervently\\n wishing I was back out there\\n on the infinitely safer desert.\\n\\n\\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.\\n \"I shouldn\\'t—not when\\n you see my motives.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We don\\'t see them,\" I\\n snapped.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, let me show you.\\n You\\'re on Mars hunting uranium,\\n right? To mine and\\n ship the radioactives back to\\n Earth to keep the atomic engines\\n going. Right?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded over at our geiger\\n counters.\\n\\n\\n \"We volunteered to come to\\n Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\\n\\n\\n \"Ah—two young heroes,\"\\n Ledman said acidly. \"How\\n sad. I could almost feel sorry\\n for you. Almost.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Just what is it you\\'re\\n after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\\n\\n\\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"\\n he said. \"You remember the\\n Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.\\n I\\'d never forget it. No one\\n would. How could I forget\\n that great accident—killing\\n hundreds, injuring thousands\\n more, sterilizing forty miles\\n of Mississippi land—when\\n the Sadlerville pile went up?\\n\\n\\n \"I was there on business at\\n the time,\" Ledman said. \"I\\n represented Ledman Atomics.\\n I was there to sign a new\\n contract for my company.\\n You know who I am, now?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n\\n \"I was fairly well shielded\\n when it happened. I never got\\n the contract, but I got a good\\n dose of radiation instead. Not\\n enough to kill me,\" he said.\\n \"Just enough to necessitate\\n the removal of—\" he indicated\\n the empty space at his\\n thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"\\n He gestured at the wheelchair\\n blanket.\\n\\n\\n I still didn\\'t understand.\\n \"But why kill us Geigs?\\nWe\\nhad nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re just in this by accident,\"\\n he said. \"You see, after\\n the explosion and the amputation,\\n my fellow-members on\\n the board of Ledman Atomics\\n decided that a semi-basket\\n case like myself was a poor\\n risk as Head of the Board,\\n and they took my company\\n away. All quite legal, I assure\\n you. They left me almost a\\n pauper!\" Then he snapped\\n the punchline at me.\\n\\n\\n \"They renamed Ledman\\n Atomics. Who did you say you\\n worked for?\"\\n\\n\\n I began, \"Uran—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t bother. A more inventive\\n title than Ledman\\n Atomics, but not quite as\\n much heart, wouldn\\'t you\\n say?\" He grinned. \"I saved\\n for years; then I came to\\n Mars, lost myself, built this\\n Dome, and swore to get even.\\n There\\'s not a great deal of\\n uranium on this planet, but\\n enough to keep me in a style\\n to which, unfortunately, I\\'m\\n no longer accustomed.\"\\nHe consulted his wrist\\n watch. \"Time for my injection.\"\\n He pulled out the tanglegun\\n and sprayed us again,\\n just to make doubly certain.\\n \"That\\'s another little souvenir\\n of Sadlerville. I\\'m short\\n on red blood corpuscles.\"\\n\\n\\n He rolled over to a wall\\n table and fumbled in a container\\n among a pile of hypodermics.\\n \"There are other injections,\\n too. Adrenalin, insulin.\\n Others. The Blast turned\\n me into a walking pin-cushion.\\n But I\\'ll pay it all\\n back,\" he said. He plunged\\n the needle into his arm.\\n\\n\\n My eyes widened. It was\\n too nightmarish to be real. I\\n wasn\\'t seriously worried\\n about his threat to wipe out\\n the entire Geig Corps, since\\n it was unlikely that one man\\n in a wheelchair could pick us\\n all off. No, it wasn\\'t the\\n threat that disturbed me, so\\n much as the whole concept, so\\n strange to me, that the human\\n mind could be as warped\\n and twisted as Ledman\\'s.\\n\\n\\n I saw the horror on Val\\'s\\n face, and I knew she felt the\\n same way I did.\\n\\n\\n \"Do you really think you\\n can succeed?\" I taunted him.\\n \"Really think you can kill\\n every Earthman on Mars? Of\\n all the insane, cockeyed—\"\\n\\n\\n Val\\'s quick, worried head-shake\\n cut me off. But Ledman\\n had felt my words, all right.\\n\\n\\n \"Yes! I\\'ll get even with\\n every one of you for taking\\n away my legs! If we hadn\\'t\\n meddled with the atom in the\\n first place, I\\'d be as tall and\\n powerful as you, today—instead\\n of a useless cripple in a\\n wheelchair.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re sick, Gregory Ledman,\"\\n Val said quietly.\\n \"You\\'ve conceived an impossible\\n scheme of revenge and\\n now you\\'re taking it out on\\n innocent people who\\'ve done\\n nothing, nothing at all to you.\\n That\\'s not sane!\"\\n\\n\\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are\\n you to talk of sanity?\"\\nUneasily I caught Val\\'s\\n glance from a corner of my\\n eye. Sweat was rolling down\\n her smooth forehead faster\\n than the auto-wiper could\\n swab it away.\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you do something?\\n What are you waiting\\n for, Ron?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I\\n knew what our ace in the hole\\n was. But I had to get Ledman\\n within reach of me first.\\n\\n\\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I\\'m going\\n to turn you loose outside,\\n right after—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nGet sick!\\n\" I hissed to Val,\\n low. She began immediately\\n to cough violently, emitting\\n harsh, choking sobs. \"Can\\'t\\n breathe!\" She began to yell,\\n writhing in her bonds.\\n\\n\\n That did it. Ledman hadn\\'t\\n much humanity left in him,\\n but there was a little. He lowered\\n the blaster a bit and\\n wheeled one-hand over to see\\n what was wrong with Val.\\n She continued to retch and\\n moan most horribly. It almost\\n convinced me. I saw Val\\'s\\n pale, frightened face turn to\\n me.\\n\\n\\n He approached and peered\\n down at her. He opened his\\n mouth to say something, and\\n at that moment I snapped my\\n leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord\\n with a snicking rasp,\\n and kicked his wheelchair\\n over.\\n\\n\\n The blaster went off, burning\\n a hole through the Dome\\n roof. The automatic sealers\\n glued-in instantly. Ledman\\n went sprawling helplessly out\\n into the middle of the floor,\\n the wheelchair upended next\\n to him, its wheels slowly revolving\\n in the air. The blaster\\n flew from his hands at the\\n impact of landing and spun\\n out near me. In one quick motion\\n I rolled over and covered\\n it with my body.\\nLedman clawed his way to\\n me with tremendous effort\\n and tried wildly to pry the\\n blaster out from under me,\\n but without success. I twisted\\n a bit, reached out with my\\n free leg, and booted him\\n across the floor. He fetched\\n up against the wall of the\\n Dome and lay there.\\n\\n\\n Val rolled over to me.\\n\\n\\n \"Now if I could get free of\\n this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get\\n him covered before he comes\\n to. But how?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She\\n swivelled around on the floor\\n until her head was near my\\n boot. \"Push my oxymask off\\n with your foot, if you can.\"\\n\\n\\n I searched for the clamp\\n and tried to flip it. No luck,\\n with my heavy, clumsy boot.\\n I tried again, and this time it\\n snapped open. I got the tip\\n of my boot in and pried upward.\\n The oxymask came off,\\n slowly, scraping a jagged red\\n scratch up the side of Val\\'s\\n neck as it came.\\n\\n\\n \"There,\" she breathed.\\n \"That\\'s that.\"\\n\\n\\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.\\n He was groaning and\\n beginning to stir.\\n\\n\\n Val rolled on the floor and\\n her face lay near my right\\n arm. I saw what she had in\\n mind. She began to nibble the\\n vile-tasting tangle-cord, running\\n her teeth up and down\\n it until it started to give. She\\n continued unfailingly.\\n\\n\\n Finally one strand snapped.\\n Then another. At last I\\n had enough use of my hand\\n to reach out and grasp the\\n blaster. Then I pulled myself\\n across the floor to Ledman,\\n removed the tanglegun, and\\n melted the remaining tangle-cord\\n off.\\n\\n\\n My muscles were stiff and\\n bunched, and rising made me\\n wince. I turned and freed Val.\\n Then I turned and faced Ledman.\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose you\\'ll kill me\\n now,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"No. That\\'s the difference\\n between sane people and insane,\"\\n I told him. \"I\\'m not\\n going to kill you at all. I\\'m\\n going to see to it that you\\'re\\n sent back to Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nNo!\\n\" he shouted. \"No!\\n Anything but back there. I\\n don\\'t want to face them again—not\\n after what they did to\\n me—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.\\n \"They\\'ll help you on Earth.\\n They\\'ll take all the hatred and\\n sickness out of you, and turn\\n you into a useful member of\\n society again.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat\\n out. \"I hate all of them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.\\n \"You\\'re just all full of\\n hate. You hated us so much\\n that you couldn\\'t bear to hang\\n around on Earth for as much\\n as a year after the Sadlerville\\n Blast. You had to take right\\n off for Mars without a moment\\'s\\n delay, didn\\'t you? You\\n hated Earth so much you\\nhad\\nto leave.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why are you telling all\\n this to me?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Because if you\\'d stayed\\n long enough, you\\'d have used\\n some of your pension money\\n to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic\\n legs, and then you\\n wouldn\\'t need this wheelchair.\"\\n\\n\\n Ledman scowled, and then\\n his face went belligerent\\n again. \"They told me I was\\n paralyzed below the waist.\\n That I\\'d never walk again,\\n even with prosthetic legs, because\\n I had no muscles to fit\\n them to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"\\n Val said.\\n\\n\\n \"It was the only way,\" he\\n protested. \"I had to get off—\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s right,\" I told him.\\n \"The atom can take away, but\\n it can give as well. Soon after\\n you left they developed\\natomic-powered\\nprosthetics—amazing\\n things, virtually robot\\n legs. All the survivors of\\n the Sadlerville Blast were\\n given the necessary replacement\\n limbs free of charge. All\\n except you. You were so sick\\n you had to get away from the\\n world you despised and come\\n here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re lying,\" he said.\\n \"It\\'s not true!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\\n\\n\\n I saw him wilt visibly, and\\n for a moment I almost felt\\n sorry for him, a pathetic legless\\n figure propped up against\\n the wall of the Dome at\\n blaster-point. But then I remembered\\n he\\'d killed twelve\\n Geigs—or more—and would\\n have added Val to the number\\n had he had the chance.\\n\"You\\'re a very sick man,\\n Ledman,\" I said. \"All this\\n time you could have been\\n happy, useful on Earth, instead\\n of being holed up here\\n nursing your hatred. You\\n might have been useful, on\\n Earth. But you decided to\\n channel everything out as revenge.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I still don\\'t believe it—those\\n legs. I might have walked\\n again. No—no, it\\'s all a lie.\\n They told me I\\'d never walk,\"\\n he said, weakly but stubbornly\\n still.\\n\\n\\n I could see his whole structure\\n of hate starting to topple,\\n and I decided to give it\\n the final push.\\n\\n\\n \"Haven\\'t you wondered\\n how I managed to break the\\n tangle-cord when I kicked you\\n over?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes—human legs aren\\'t\\n strong enough to break tangle-cord\\n that way.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I\\n gave Val the blaster and slipped\\n out of my oxysuit.\\n \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to\\n my smooth, gleaming metal\\n legs. The almost soundless\\n purr of their motors was the\\n only noise in the room. \"I was\\n in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"\\n I said. \"But I didn\\'t go crazy\\n with hate when I lost\\nmy\\nlegs.\"\\n\\n\\n Ledman was sobbing.\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.\\n Val got him into his suit, and\\n brought him the fishbowl helmet.\\n \"Get your helmet on and\\n let\\'s go. Between the psychs\\n and the prosthetics men,\\n you\\'ll be a new man inside of\\n a year.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But I\\'m a murderer!\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right. And you\\'ll be\\n sentenced to psych adjustment.\\n When they\\'re finished,\\n Gregory Ledman the killer\\n will be as dead as if they\\'d\\n electrocuted you, but there\\'ll\\n be a new—and sane—Gregory\\n Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\\n\\n\\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\\n\\n\\n For the first time since\\n Ledman had caught us, I remembered\\n how tired Val had\\n been out on the desert. I realized\\n now that I had been driving\\n her mercilessly—me, with\\n my chromium legs and atomic-powered\\n muscles. No wonder\\n she was ready to fold!\\n And I\\'d been too dense to see\\n how unfair I had been.\\n\\n\\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,\\n and I put Ledman\\n back in his wheelchair.\\n\\n\\n Val slipped her oxymask\\n back on and fastened it shut.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get back to the Dome\\n in a hurry,\" I said. \"We\\'ll\\n turn Ledman over to the authorities.\\n Then we can catch\\n the next ship for Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Go back?\\nGo back?\\nIf you\\n think I\\'m backing down now\\n and quitting you can find\\n yourself another wife! After\\n we dump this guy I\\'m sacking\\n in for twenty hours, and then\\n we\\'re going back out there to\\n finish that search-pattern.\\n Earth needs uranium, honey,\\n and I know you\\'d never be\\n happy quitting in the middle\\n like that.\" She smiled. \"I\\n can\\'t wait to get out there\\n and start listening for those\\n tell-tale clicks.\"\\n\\n\\n I gave a joyful whoop and\\n swung her around. When I\\n put her down, she squeezed\\n my hand, hard.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get moving, fellow\\n hero,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n I pressed the stud for the\\n airlock, smiling.\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAmazing Stories\\nSeptember 1956.\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n copyright on this publication was renewed.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nDark was the Ryzga mountain and forbidding; steep were its\\n cliffs and sheer its crevasses. But its outward perils could not compare\\n with the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and\\n conquer....\\nAt sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered\\n among the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense\\n and repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the\\n dying sun.\\n\\n\\n Neena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.\\n The ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var\\'s love was round her as a\\n warming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening\\n twilight, even as her love was about him.\\n\\n\\n Var said, \"The Watcher\\'s cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"\\n He stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher\\'s thoughts, but\\n there was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other\\n direction, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to\\n sense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with\\n vengeance.\\n\\n\\n \"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They\\'re closer than they were an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\\n She was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black\\n mountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He\\n felt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.\\n For the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,\\n she had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to\\n follow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would\\n be death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse\\n was no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the\\n last days.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to\\n the crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.\\n It was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen\\n reached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and\\n strange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an\\n avalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening\\n from the crevices of the rock.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\\n\\n\\n Var sighed, shaking his head. \"It won\\'t hold them for long, but it\\'s the\\n best I can do now. Come on.\"\\n\\n\\n There was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the\\n sierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer\\n ascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be\\n crossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings\\n cost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might\\n never have won through.\\n\\n\\n It was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher\\'s\\n cave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the\\n glacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was\\n sealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from\\n the rocks above. They heard no sound.\\n\\n\\n The two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.\\n Both had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep\\n watch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their\\n childhood; but neither had been here before.\\n\\n\\n But this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to\\n make sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly\\n with his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling\\n in the light that poured from within.\\nThey felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him—a\\n shrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight\\n of him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was\\n disappointing. They had expected something more—an ancient giant, a\\n tower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;\\n beside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\\n\\n\\n The Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked\\n voice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in\\n thought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he\\n had not meant to be.\\n\\n\\n The old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.\\n Come in! You\\'re letting in the wind.\"\\n\\n\\n Inside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that\\n all the walls were sheathed in ice—warm to the touch, bound fast\\n against melting by the Watcher\\'s will. Light blazed in reflections from\\n the ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began\\n a tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to\\n descend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into\\n lengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then\\n turned questioningly to the young pair.\\n\\n\\n \"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can\\n spare it. We\\'re pursued.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves\\n comfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world\\n is as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\\n\\n\\n Hot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded\\n them with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of\\n weariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy\\'s daughter, no\\n doubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\\n\\n\\n Warming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena\\'s history\\n briefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before\\n very long, I\\'m sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would\\n recognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud\\n between our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us\\n off and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours\\n behind us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you—but, you understand, I am the\\n Mountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\\n\\n\\n Var nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be\\n able to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\\n\\n\\n \"And what will you do now?\"\\n\\n\\n Var grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven\\'t much choice, since they\\'re\\n overtaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear\\n to follow us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To the mountain, you mean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And into it, if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she\\n nestled by Var\\'s side. He asked, \"And you—are you willing to follow\\n your lover in this?\"\\n\\n\\n Neena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at\\n Var, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,\\n I will lead, if his courage should fail him.\"\\nThe old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this\\n thing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you\\n are doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to\\n guard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves\\n and on all men.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their\\n mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world\\n crumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the\\n Ryzgas will come forth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you believe that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"As one believes stories.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated\\n farther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the\\n First Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they\\n come again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard\\n them now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,\\n the mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled\\n below, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the\\n power in the old man\\'s look, the power of four hundred years\\' wisdom.\\n Var stared down at his hands.\\n\\n\\n \"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race\\n as the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before\\n the Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such\\n tyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled\\n the Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.\\n They laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to\\n its heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of\\n their works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of\\n those four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great\\n and evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\\n\\n\\n \"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only\\n fire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the\\n Earth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.\\n If you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will\\n find numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and\\n strange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks\\n of their shaping—the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And\\n we—we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity\\n that survived when the Ryzgas\\' world went down in flame and thunder.\\n\\n\\n \"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science\\n that the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their\\n weapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making\\n sure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.\\n Meanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the\\n completion of the last of the starships.\\n\\n\\n \"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the\\n memories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a\\n picture of that world\\'s end. I will show it to you....\"\\nVar and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old\\n man wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their\\n vision, and they saw—\\n\\n\\n Black starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city\\n that was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city\\'s\\n darkness—that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted\\n the naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a\\n shaking of the earth.\\n\\n\\n Along lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,\\n poured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,\\n naked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where\\n the Ryzgas\\' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half\\n sightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long\\n last clutched the weapons of the last rebellion—a rebellion without\\n hope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of\\n the Ryzgas\\' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\\n\\n\\n Before them death waited around the citadel where the masters still\\n fought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the\\n shattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the\\n lightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\\n\\n\\n Then, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept\\n outward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had\\n shouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were\\n lifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense\\n white globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\\n\\n\\n They had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,\\n and it was leaving.\\n\\n\\n It poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the\\n millions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others\\n cried desolately—\\nwait!\\nThen the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping\\n fires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist\\n and swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and\\n the ship was gone.\\n\\n\\n The stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the\\n citadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,\\n and the city burned and burned....\\nVar blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm\\n tightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that\\n he and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a\\n vision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen—no, lived\\n through—before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man\\n who was the Mountain Watcher.\\n\\n\\n \"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on\\n Earth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to\\n rule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth\\'s\\n heart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,\\n their deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone\\n dare arouse them, or until their chosen time—no one knows surely.\\n\\n\\n \"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the\\n old time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain\\n in ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,\\n folly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy\\n world, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,\\n \"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if\\n in your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\\n\\n\\n Neena pressed her face against Var\\'s shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her\\n mind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var\\n looked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher\\n seemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his\\n own limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,\\n \"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\\n\\n\\n Var strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and\\n that sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and\\n drowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave\\n swam and dissolved; his eyelids closed.\\nVar woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had\\n been unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic\\n gripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how\\n it was.\\n\\n\\n He came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that\\n sleep had refreshed his mind and body—realizing also that a footstep\\n had wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him\\n coolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know\\n the face.\\n\\n\\n Neena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?\\n Where\\'s the Watcher?\"\\n\\n\\n The other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I\\'m the Watcher,\" he\\n answered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the\\n day passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They\\n were all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\\n\\n\\n Var passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,\\n Watcher.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are\\n rested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga\\n mountain?\"\\n\\n\\n Not looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no\\n alternative.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh\\n breeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and\\n they followed him outside.\\n\\n\\n The glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.\\n It rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right\\n and left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by\\n the morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and\\n gave nothing back.\\n\\n\\n Below their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling\\n a mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river\\n dashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the\\n curling fog hid everything.\\n\\n\\n \"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their\\n eyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his\\n face was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the\\n north, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking\\n your presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other\\n direction, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers\\n will be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will\\n be too late for them to overtake Var.\"\\n\\n\\n That possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked\\n at one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into\\n one.\\n\\n\\n They thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \"\\nIt\\n would work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery—yet\\n these can be borne—that I-you might be saved from death—which is alone\\n irreparable.... But to become\\nI\\nand\\nyou\\nagain—that cannot be\\n borne.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n They said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher\\'s face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will\\n give you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the\\n Ryzga mountain.\"\\n\\n\\n Quickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of\\n the mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little\\n dizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\\n\\n\\n \"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice\\n was cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the\\n Watcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\\n\\n\\n Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena\\'s\\n mind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You\\n don\\'t blame us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does\\n that needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\"\\nThey groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling\\n river, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream\\n bridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would\\n cross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at\\n last on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that\\n the pursuit already halved their lead.\\n\\n\\n They stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the\\n doorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into\\n the face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain—so\\n little had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\\n\\n\\n Var sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,\\n head thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond\\n slanted steeply downward. Var\\'s hands moved, molding a radiant globe\\n from the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an\\n abrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness\\n had drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it\\n had passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the\\n mountain something snapped suddenly alert—something alive yet not\\n living, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in\\n response, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle\\n circuits....\\n\\n\\n The two stood shivering together.\\n\\n\\n The morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they\\n heard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\\n\\n\\n Var and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that\\n they could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was\\n too far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the\\n thought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I\\'ve\\n caught you now!\"\\n\\n\\n Behind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.\\n Neena\\'s hand tightened on Var\\'s. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go\\n back! Or you\\'ll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\\n\\n\\n Groz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and\\n for the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the\\n mountain\\'s black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of\\n sky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling\\n Neena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the\\n grip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist\\n billowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him\\n exhorting his men to haste.\\n\\n\\n Neena\\'s face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent\\n whisper said, \"Come on!\"\\n\\n\\n Together they plunged into the curtain of darkness.\\nAt Var\\'s thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he\\n muttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle\\n of currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising\\n potential that seemed to whisper\\nReady ... ready....\\nThe sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the\\n featureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain\\'s heart. Var\\n summoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more—\\n\\n\\n Between wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,\\n pulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.\\n The immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\\n\\n\\n \"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet\\n further on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had\\n made it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into\\n these uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense\\n had saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not\\n blocked....\\n\\n\\n Then they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote\\n vibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor\\n under their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense\\n energies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that\\n was in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the\\n mechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make\\n ready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that\\n might be near at hand.\\n\\n\\n From behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,\\n then a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the\\n dark burrow:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nStop!\\n—before you go too far!\"\\n\\n\\n Var faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go\\n free.\"\\n\\n\\n In the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with\\n that of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each\\n knew with finality that the other\\'s stubbornness matched his own—that\\n neither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world\\n outside should crumble to ruin around them.\\n\\n\\n \"Follow us, then!\"\\n\\n\\n They plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain\\n increased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound\\n was like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.\\n Through the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo\\n the death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood\\n before their monstrous and inhuman power.\\n\\n\\n Without warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena\\n saw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded\\n room that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward\\n to the threshold of that chamber at the mountain\\'s heart.\\n\\n\\n Its roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded\\n with gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched\\n light flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the\\n progressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this\\n must be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened\\n and closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid\\n shifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\\n\\n\\n For long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at\\n this place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of\\n their machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.\\n They looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:\\n perhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and\\n only the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over\\n the threshold.\\n\\n\\n There was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,\\n above a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a\\n massive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\\n\\n\\n Var and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their\\n last. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them.\\nHe was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of\\n changing colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,\\n with the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;\\n his other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.\\n That, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,\\n conveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet\\n not wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga\\'s\\n manner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and\\n assurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\\n\\n\\n With a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga\\'s thoughts were quite\\n open. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and\\n unsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible\\n symbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to\\n close his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\\n\\n\\n He paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the\\n interlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,\\n but not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like\\n metal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The\\n image occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily\\n have been totally strange.\\n\\n\\n \"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality—good. Physically\\n excellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible\\n schemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand\\n years—more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all\\n initially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We\\n can begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool\\n progression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating\\n in its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,\\n crawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas\\' will—\\ntoward the stars, the\\n stars!\\nThe icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones\\n indicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\\n\\n\\n Var was staring in fascination at the Ryzga\\'s face. It was a face formed\\n by the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply\\n ingrained weariness, the signs of premature age—denied, overridden by\\n the driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man\\'s\\n face.\\n\\n\\n The Ryzga\\'s final thought clicked into place:\\nDecision!\\nHe turned\\n toward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for\\n one spot upon it.\\n\\n\\n Neena screamed.\\n\\n\\n Between the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up\\n seven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes\\n and white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.\\n There was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster\\n crumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\\n\\n\\n But in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it\\n remained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The\\n Ryzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip\\n closed down on all his motor nerves.\\n\\n\\n Holding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into\\n the Ryzga\\'s frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and\\n such evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga\\'s\\n efforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as\\n misdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to\\n wrestle with the mind.\\n\\n\\n Var had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream\\n monster into the Ryzga\\'s way—a mere child\\'s bogey out of a fairy\\n tale—the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a\\n real being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates\\n with an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other\\'s mind. \"There\\n will be no new beginning for you in\\nour\\nworld, Ryzga! In two thousand\\n years, we\\'ve learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you\\n built so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and\\n energy to do simple tasks—it was because you knew no other way.\"\\n\\n\\n Behind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.\\n \"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine\\n civilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed\\n its fuel. After us\\nman\\ncould not survive on the Earth, because the\\n conditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be\\n something else—capacities undeveloped by our science—after us the end\\n of man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\\n\\n\\n The tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The\\n Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his\\n paralyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp\\n and fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has\\n failed.\\n\\n\\n Var felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,\\n he continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he\\n raised his head, he saw that the drama\\'s end had had a further audience.\\n In the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first\\n in stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at\\n Var.\\n\\n\\n Var eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?\\n Is our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go\\n beyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\\nTO EACH HIS STAR\\nby\\nBRYCE WALTON\\n\"Nothing around those other suns but ashes and dried\\n blood,\" old Dunbar told the space-wrecked, desperate men.\\n \"Only one way to go, where we can float down through the\\n clouds to Paradise. That\\'s straight ahead to the sun with\\n the red rim around it.\"\\nBut Dunbar\\'s eyes were old and uncertain. How could they\\n believe in his choice when every star in this forsaken\\n section of space was surrounded by a beckoning red rim?\\nThere was just blackness, frosty glimmering terrible blackness, going\\n out and out forever in all directions. Russell didn\\'t think they could\\n remain sane in all this blackness much longer. Bitterly he thought of\\n how they would die—not knowing within maybe thousands of light years\\n where they were, or where they were going.\\n\\n\\n After the wreck, the four of them had floated a while, floated and\\n drifted together, four men in bulbous pressure suits like small\\n individual rockets, held together by an awful pressing need for each\\n other and by the \"gravity-rope\" beam.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar, the oldest of the four, an old space-buster with a face\\n wrinkled like a dried prune, burned by cosmic rays and the suns of\\n worlds so far away they were scarcely credible, had taken command.\\n Suddenly, Old Dunbar had known where they were. Suddenly, Dunbar knew\\n where they were going.\\n\\n\\n They could talk to one another through the etheric transmitters inside\\n their helmets. They could live ... if this was living ... a long time,\\n if only a man\\'s brain would hold up, Russell thought. The suits were\\n complete units. 700 pounds each, all enclosing shelters, with\\n atmosphere pressure, temperature control, mobility in space, and\\n electric power. Each suit had its own power-plant, reprocessing\\n continuously the precious air breathed by the occupants, putting it\\n back into circulation again after enriching it. Packed with food\\n concentrates. Each suit a rocket, each human being part of a rocket,\\n and the special \"life-gun\" that went with each suit each blast of\\n which sent a man a few hundred thousand miles further on toward\\n wherever he was going.\\n\\n\\n Four men, thought Russell, held together by an invisible string of\\n gravity, plunging through a lost pocket of hell\\'s dark where there had\\n never been any sound or life, with old Dunbar the first in line,\\n taking the lead because he was older and knew where he was and where\\n he was going. Maybe Johnson, second in line, and Alvar who was third,\\n knew too, but were afraid to admit it.\\n\\n\\n But Russell knew it and he\\'d admitted it from the first—that old\\n Dunbar was as crazy as a Jovian juke-bird.\\n\\n\\n A lot of time had rushed past into darkness. Russell had no idea now\\n how long the four of them had been plunging toward the red-rimmed sun\\n that never seemed to get any nearer. When the ultra-drive had gone\\n crazy the four of them had blanked out and nobody could say now how\\n long an interim that had been. Nobody knew what happened to a man who\\n suffered a space-time warping like that. When they had regained\\n consciousness, the ship was pretty banged up, and the meteor-repeller\\n shields cracked. A meteor ripped the ship down the center like an old\\n breakfast cannister.\\n\\n\\n How long ago that had been, Russell didn\\'t know. All Russell knew was\\n that they were millions of light years from any place he had ever\\n heard about, where the galactic space lanterns had absolutely no\\n recognizable pattern. But Dunbar knew. And Russell was looking at\\n Dunbar\\'s suit up ahead, watching it more and more intently, thinking\\n about how Dunbar looked inside that suit—and hating Dunbar more and\\n more for claiming he knew when he didn\\'t, for his drooling\\n optimism—because he was taking them on into deeper darkness and\\n calling their destination Paradise.\\n\\n\\n Russell wanted to laugh, but the last time he\\'d given way to this\\n impulse, the results inside his helmet had been too unpleasant to\\n repeat.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes Russell thought of other things besides his growing hatred\\n of the old man. Sometimes he thought about the ship, lost back there\\n in the void, and he wondered if wrecked space ships were ever found.\\n Compared with the universe in which one of them drifted, a wrecked\\n ship was a lot smaller than a grain of sand on a nice warm beach back\\n on Earth, or one of those specks of silver dust that floated like\\n strange seeds down the night winds of Venus.\\n\\n\\n And a human was smaller still, thought Russell when he was not hating\\n Dunbar. Out here, a human being is the smallest thing of all. He\\n thought then of what Dunbar would say to such a thought, how Dunbar\\n would laugh that high piping squawking laugh of his and say that the\\n human being was bigger than the Universe itself.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar had a big answer for every little thing.\\n\\n\\n When the four of them had escaped from that prison colony on a\\n sizzling hot asteroid rock in the Ronlwhyn system, that wasn\\'t enough\\n for Dunbar. Hell no—Dunbar had to start talking about a place they\\n could go where they\\'d never be apprehended, in a system no one else\\n had ever heard of, where they could live like gods on a green soft\\n world like the Earth had been a long time back.\\n\\n\\n And Dunbar had spouted endlessly about a world of treasure they would\\n find, if they would just follow old Dunbar. That\\'s what all four of\\n them had been trying to find all their lives in the big cold grabbag\\n of eternity—a rich star, a rich far fertile star where no one else\\n had ever been, loaded with treasure that had no name, that no one had\\n ever heard of before. And was, because of that, the richest treasure\\n of all.\\n\\n\\n We all look alike out here in these big rocket pressure suits, Russell\\n thought. No one for God only knew how many of millions of light years\\n away could see or care. Still—we might have a chance to live, even\\n now, Russell thought—if it weren\\'t for old crazy Dunbar.\\n\\n\\n They might have a chance if Alvar and Johnson weren\\'t so damn lacking\\n in self-confidence as to put all their trust in that crazed old\\n rum-dum. Russell had known now for some time that they were going in\\n the wrong direction. No reason for knowing. Just a hunch. And Russell\\n was sure his hunch was right.\\nRussell said. \"Look—look to your left and to your right and behind\\n us. Four suns. You guys see those other three suns all around you,\\n don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Sure,\" someone said.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if you\\'ll notice,\" Russell said, \"the one on the left also now\\n has a red rim around it. Can\\'t you guys see that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, I see it,\" Alvar said.\\n\\n\\n \"So now,\" Johnson said, \"there\\'s two suns with red rims around them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re about in the middle of those four suns aren\\'t we, Dunbar?\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right, boys!\" yelled old Dunbar in that sickeningly optimistic\\n voice. Like a hysterical old woman\\'s. \"Just about in the sweet dark\\n old middle.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re still sure it\\'s the sun up ahead ... that\\'s the only one with\\n life on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?\" Russell asked.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right! That\\'s right,\" Dunbar yelled. \"That\\'s the only one—and\\n it\\'s a paradise. Not just a place to live, boys—but a place you\\'ll\\n have trouble believing in because it\\'s like a dream!\"\\n\\n\\n \"And none of these other three suns have worlds we could live on,\\n Dunbar?\" Russell asked. Keep the old duck talking like this and maybe\\n Alvar and Johnson would see that he was cracked.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"You still say that, Dunbar?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No life, boys, nothing,\" Dunbar laughed. \"Nothing on these other\\n worlds but ashes ... just ashes and iron and dried blood, dried a\\n million years or more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"When in hell were you ever here?\" Johnson said. \"You say you were\\n here before. You never said when, or why or anything!\"\\n\\n\\n \"It was a long time back boys. Don\\'t remember too well, but it was\\n when we had an old ship called the DOG STAR that I was here. A pirate\\n ship and I was second in command, and we came through this sector.\\n That was—hell, it musta\\' been fifty years ago. I been too many places\\n nobody\\'s ever bothered to name or chart, to remember where it is, but\\n I been here. I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect\\n circle from this point, with us squarely in the middle. We explored\\n all these suns and the worlds that go round \\'em. Trust me, boys, and\\n we\\'ll reach the right one. And that one\\'s just like Paradise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Paradise is it,\" Russell whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n \"Paradise and there we\\'ll be like gods, like Mercuries with wings\\n flying on nights of sweet song. These other suns, don\\'t let them\\n bother you. They\\'re Jezebels of stars. All painted up in the darkness\\n and pretty and waiting and calling and lying! They make you think of\\n nice green worlds all running waters and dews and forests thick as\\n fleas on a wet dog. But it ain\\'t there, boys. I know this place. I\\n been here, long time back.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell said tightly. \"It\\'ll take us a long time won\\'t it? If it\\'s got\\n air we can breath, and water we can drink and shade we can rest\\n in—that\\'ll be paradise enough for us. But it\\'ll take a long time\\n won\\'t it? And what if it isn\\'t there—what if after all the time we\\n spend hoping and getting there—there won\\'t be nothing but ashes and\\n cracked clay?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know we\\'re going right,\" Dunbar said cheerfully. \"I can tell. Like\\n I said—you can tell it because of the red rim around it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But the sun on our left, you can see—it\\'s got a red rim too now,\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Alvar. \"Sometimes I see a red rim around\\n the one we\\'re going for, sometimes a red rim around that one on the\\n left. Now, sometimes I\\'m not sure either of them\\'s got a red rim. You\\n said that one had a red rim, Dunbar, and I wanted to believe it. So\\n now maybe we\\'re all seeing a red rim that was never there.\"\\n\\n\\n Old Dunbar laughed. The sound brought blood hotly to Russell\\'s face.\\n \"We\\'re heading to the right one, boys. Don\\'t doubt me ... I been here.\\n We explored all these sun systems. And I remember it all. The second\\n planet from that red-rimmed sun. You come down through a soft\\n atmosphere, floating like in a dream. You see the green lakes coming\\n up through the clouds and the women dancing and the music playing. I\\n remember seeing a ship there that brought those women there, a long\\n long time before ever I got there. A land like heaven and women like\\n angels singing and dancing and laughing with red lips and arms white\\n as milk, and soft silky hair floating in the winds.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell was very sick of the old man\\'s voice. He was at least glad he\\n didn\\'t have to look at the old man now. His bald head, his skinny\\n bobbing neck, his simpering watery blue eyes. But he still had to\\n suffer that immutable babbling, that idiotic cheerfulness ... and\\n knowing all the time the old man was crazy, that he was leading them\\n wrong.\\n\\n\\n I\\'d break away, go it alone to the right sun, Russell thought—but I\\'d\\n never make it alone. A little while out here alone and I\\'d be nuttier\\n than old Dunbar will ever be, even if he keeps on getting nuttier all\\n the time.\\n\\n\\n Somewhere, sometime then ... Russell got the idea that the only way\\n was to get rid of Dunbar.\\nYou mean to tell us there are people living by that red-rimmed sun,\"\\n Russell said.\\n\\n\\n \"Lost people ... lost ... who knows how long,\" Dunbar said, as the\\n four of them hurtled along. \"You never know where you\\'ll find people\\n on a world somewhere nobody\\'s ever named or knows about. Places where\\n a lost ship\\'s landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far\\n off the lanes they\\'ll never be found except by accident for millions\\n of years. That\\'s what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load\\n of beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled\\n to some outpost to entertain. They\\'re like angels now, living in a\\n land all free from care. Every place you see green forests and fields\\n and blue lakes, and at nights there\\'s three moons that come around the\\n sky in a thousand different colors. And it never gets cold ... it\\'s\\n always spring, always spring, boys, and the music plays all night,\\n every night of a long long year....\"\\n\\n\\n Russell suddenly shouted. \"Keep quiet, Dunbar. Shut up will you?\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson said. \"Dunbar—how long\\'ll it take us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Six months to a year, I\\'d say,\" Dunbar yelled happily. \"That is—of\\n our hereditary time.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" croaked Alvar.\\n\\n\\n Johnson didn\\'t say anything at all.\\n\\n\\n Russell screamed at Dunbar, then quieted down. He whispered. \"Six\\n months to a year—out here—cooped up in these damn suits. You\\'re\\n crazy as hell, Dunbar. Crazy ... crazy! Nobody could stand it. We\\'ll\\n all be crazier than you are—\"\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll make it, boys. Trust ole\\' Dunbar. What\\'s a year when we know\\n we\\'re getting to Paradise at the end of it? What\\'s a year out here ...\\n it\\'s paradise ain\\'t it, compared with that prison hole we were rotting\\n in? We can make it. We have the food concentrates, and all the rest.\\n All we need\\'s the will, boys, and we got that. The whole damn Universe\\n isn\\'t big enough to kill the will of a human being, boys. I been over\\n a whole lot of it, and I know. In the old days—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The hell with the old days,\" screamed Russell.\\n\\n\\n \"Now quiet down, Russ,\" Dunbar said in a kind of dreadful crooning\\n whisper. \"You calm down now. You younger fellows—you don\\'t look at\\n things the way we used to. Thing is, we got to go straight. People\\n trapped like this liable to start meandering. Liable to start losing\\n the old will-power.\"\\n\\n\\n He chuckled.\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"Someone says maybe we ought to go left, and\\n someone says to go right, and someone else says to go in another\\n direction. And then someone says maybe they\\'d better go back the old\\n way. An\\' pretty soon something breaks, or the food runs out, and\\n you\\'re a million million miles from someplace you don\\'t care about any\\n more because you\\'re dead. All frozen up in space ... preserved like a\\n piece of meat in a cold storage locker. And then maybe in a million\\n years or so some lousy insect man from Jupiter comes along and finds\\n you and takes you away to a museum....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up!\" Johnson yelled.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar laughed. \"Boys, boys, don\\'t get panicky. Keep your heads. Just\\n stick to old Dunbar and he\\'ll see you through. I\\'m always lucky. Only\\n one way to go ... an\\' that\\'s straight ahead to the sun with the\\n red-rim around it ... and then we tune in the gravity repellers, and\\n coast down, floating and singing down through the clouds to\\n paradise.\"\\n\\n\\n After that they traveled on for what seemed months to Russell, but it\\n couldn\\'t have been over a day or two of the kind of time-sense he had\\n inherited from Earth.\\n\\n\\n Then he saw how the other two stars also were beginning to develop red\\n rims. He yelled this fact out to the others. And Alvar said. \"Russ\\'s\\n right. That sun to the right, and the one behind us ... now they ALL\\n have red rims around them. Dunbar—\" A pause and no awareness of\\n motion.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar laughed. \"Sure, they all maybe have a touch of red, but it\\n isn\\'t the same, boys. I can tell the difference. Trust me—\"\\n\\n\\n Russell half choked on his words. \"You old goat! With those old eyes\\n of yours, you couldn\\'t see your way into a fire!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t get panicky now. Keep your heads. In another year, we\\'ll be\\n there—\"\\n\\n\\n \"God, you gotta\\' be sure,\" Alvar said. \"I don\\'t mind dyin\\' out here.\\n But after a year of this, and then to get to a world that was only\\n ashes, and not able to go any further—\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always come through, boys. I\\'m lucky. Angel women will take us to\\n their houses on the edges of cool lakes, little houses that sit there\\n in the sun like fancy jewels. And we\\'ll walk under colored fountains,\\n pretty colored fountains just splashing and splashing like pretty rain\\n on our hungry hides. That\\'s worth waiting for.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell did it before he hardly realized he was killing the old man.\\n It was something he had had to do for a long time and that made it\\n easy. There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of\\n Dunbar. If he\\'d aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have\\n pierced Dunbar\\'s back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished\\n automatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated,\\n self-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them\\n hurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front\\n of the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead.\\n\\n\\n He was dead and his mouth was shut for good.\\n\\n\\n Dunbar\\'s last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell\\'s\\n ears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and\\n Johnson both called Dunbar\\'s name a few times. There was no answer.\\n\\n\\n \"Russ—you shouldn\\'t have done that,\" Johnson whispered. \"You\\n shouldn\\'t have done that to the old man!\"\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" Alvar said, so low he could barely be heard. \"You shouldn\\'t have\\n done it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I did it for the three of us,\" Russell said. \"It was either him or us.\\n Lies ... lies that was all he had left in his crazy head. Paradise ...\\n don\\'t tell me you guys don\\'t see the red rims around all four suns, all\\n four suns all around us. Don\\'t tell me you guys didn\\'t know he was batty,\\n that you really believed all that stuff he was spouting all the time!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was lying, maybe not,\" Johnson said. \"Now he\\'s dead anyway.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was wrong, crazy, full of lies,\" Alvar said. \"But now he\\'s\\n dead.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How could he see any difference in those four stars?\" Russell said,\\n louder.\\n\\n\\n \"He thought he was right,\" Alvar said. \"He wanted to take us to\\n paradise. He was happy, nothing could stop the old man—but he\\'s dead\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n He sighed.\\n\\n\\n \"He was taking us wrong ... wrong!\" Russell screamed. \"Angels—music\\n all night—houses like jewels—and women like angels—\"\\n\\n\\n \"\\nShhhh\\n,\" said Alvar. It was quiet. How could it be so quiet, Russell\\n thought? And up ahead the old man\\'s pressure suit with a corpse inside\\n went on ahead, leading the other three at the front of the\\n gravity-rope.\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was wrong,\" Alvar said. \"But now do we know which way is\\n right?\"\\nSometime later, Johnson said, \"We got to decide now. Let\\'s forget the\\n old man. Let\\'s forget him and all that\\'s gone and let\\'s start now and\\n decide what to do.\"\\n\\n\\n And Alvar said, \"Guess he was crazy all right, and I guess we trusted\\n him because we didn\\'t have the strength to make up our own minds. Why\\n does a crazy man\\'s laugh sound so good when you\\'re desperate and don\\'t\\n know what to do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always had a feeling we were going wrong,\" Johnson said. \"Anyway,\\n it\\'s forgotten, Russ. It\\'s swallowed up in the darkness all around.\\n It\\'s never been.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell said, \"I\\'ve had a hunch all along that maybe the old man was\\n here before, and that he was right about there being a star here with\\n a world we can live on. But I\\'ve known we was heading wrong. I\\'ve had\\n a hunch all along that the right star was the one to the left.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I don\\'t know,\" Johnson sighed. \"I been feeling partial toward that\\n one on the right. What about you, Alvar?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I always thought we were going straight in the opposite direction\\n from what we should, I guess. I always wanted to turn around and go\\n back. It won\\'t make over maybe a month\\'s difference. And what does a\\n month matter anyway out here—hell there never was any time out here\\n until we came along. We make our own time here, and a month don\\'t\\n matter to me.\"\\n\\n\\n Sweat ran down Russell\\'s face. His voice trembled. \"No—that\\'s wrong.\\n You\\'re both wrong.\" He could see himself going it alone. Going crazy\\n because he was alone. He\\'d have broken away, gone his own direction,\\n long ago but for that fear.\\n\\n\\n \"How can we tell which of us is right?\" Alvar said. \"It\\'s like\\n everything was changing all the time out here. Sometimes I\\'d swear\\n none of those suns had red rims, and at other times—like the old man\\n said, they\\'re all pretty and lying and saying nothing, just changing\\n all the time. Jezebel stars, the old man said.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I know I\\'m right,\" Russell pleaded. \"My hunches always been right.\\n My hunch got us out of that prison didn\\'t it? Listen—I tell you it\\'s\\n that star to the left—\"\\n\\n\\n \"The one to the right,\" said Johnson.\\n\\n\\n \"We been going away from the right one all the time,\" said Alvar.\\n\\n\\n \"We got to stay together,\" said Russell. \"Nobody could spend a year\\n out here ... alone....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ah ... in another month or so we\\'d be lousy company anyway,\" Alvar\\n said. \"Maybe a guy could get to the point where he\\'d sleep most of the\\n time ... just wake up enough times to give himself another boost with\\n the old life-gun.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We got to face it,\" Johnson said finally. \"We three don\\'t go on\\n together any more.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s it,\" said Alvar. \"There\\'s three suns that look like they might\\n be right seeing as how we all agree the old man was wrong. But we\\n believe there is one we can live by, because we all seem to agree that\\n the old man might have been right about that. If we stick together,\\n the chance is three to one against us. But if each of us makes for one\\n star, one of us has a chance to live. Maybe not in paradise like the\\n old man said, but a place where we can live. And maybe there\\'ll be\\n intelligent life, maybe even a ship, and whoever gets the right star\\n can come and help the other two....\"\\n\\n\\n \"No ... God no....\" Russell whispered over and over. \"None of us can\\n ever make it alone....\"\\n\\n\\n Alvar said, \"We each take the star he likes best. I\\'ll go back the\\n other way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the\\n right.\"\\n\\n\\n Johnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and\\n above his own yelling he could hear Johnson\\'s rising laughter. \"Every\\n guy\\'s got a star of his own,\" Johnson said when he stopped laughing.\\n \"And we got ours. A nice red-rimmed sun for each of us to call his\\n very own.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Alvar said. \"We cut off the gravity rope, and each to his own\\n sun.\"\\n\\n\\n Now Russell wasn\\'t saying anything.\\n\\n\\n \"And the old man,\" Alvar said, \"can keep right on going toward what he\\n thought was right. And he\\'ll keep on going. Course he won\\'t be able to\\n give himself another boost with the life-gun, but he\\'ll keep going.\\n Someday he\\'ll get to that red-rimmed star of his. Out here in space,\\n once you\\'re going, you never stop ... and I guess there isn\\'t any\\n other body to pull him off his course. And what will time matter to\\n old Dunbar? Even less than to us, I guess. He\\'s dead and he won\\'t\\n care.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready,\" Johnson said. \"I\\'ll cut off the gravity rope.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m ready,\" Alvar said. \"To go back toward whatever it was I started\\n from.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ready, Russ?\"\\n\\n\\n Russell couldn\\'t say anything. He stared at the endless void which now\\n he would share with no one. Not even crazy old Dunbar.\\n\\n\\n \"All right,\" Johnson said. \"Good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n Russell felt the release, felt the sudden inexplicable isolation and\\n aloneness even before Alvar and Johnson used their life-guns and shot\\n out of sight, Johnson toward the left and Alvar back toward that other\\n red-rimmed sun behind them.\\n\\n\\n And old Dunbar shooting right on ahead. And all three of them\\n dwindling and dwindling and blinking out like little lights.\\n\\n\\n Fading, he could hear their voices. \"Each to his own star,\" Johnson\\n said. \"On a bee line.\"\\n\\n\\n \"On a bee line,\" Alvar said.\\n\\n\\n Russell used his own life-gun and in a little while he didn\\'t hear\\n Alvar or Johnson\\'s voices, nor could he see them. They were thousands\\n of miles away, and going further all the time.\\n\\n\\n Russell\\'s head fell forward against the front of his helmet, and he\\n closed his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"I shouldn\\'t have killed the old\\n man. Maybe one sun\\'s as good as another....\"\\n\\n\\n Then he raised his body and looked out into the year of blackness that\\n waited for him, stretching away to the red-rimmed sun. Even if he were\\n right—he was sure now he\\'d never make it alone.\\nThe body inside the pressure suit drifted into a low-level orbit\\n around the second planet from the sun of its choice, and drifted there\\n a long time. A strato-cruiser detected it by chance because of the\\n strong concentration of radio-activity that came from it.\\n\\n\\n They took the body down to one of the small, quiet towns on the edge\\n of one of the many blue lakes where the domed houses were like bright\\n joyful jewels. They got the leathery, well-preserved body from the\\n pressure suit.\\n\\n\\n \"An old man,\" one of them mused. \"A very old man. From one of the lost\\n sectors. I wonder how and why he came so very far from his home?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Wrecked a ship out there, probably,\" one of the others said. \"But he\\n managed to get this far. It looks as though a small meteor fragment\\n pierced his body. Here. You see?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes,\" another of them said. \"But what amazes me is that this old man\\n picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire\\n sector that would sustain life.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains\\n such an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about\\n the lost sectors.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Maybe he knew the way here. Maybe he was here before—sometime.\"\\n\\n\\n The other shook his head. \"I don\\'t think so. They say some humans from\\n that far sector did land here—but that\\'s probably only a myth. And if\\n they did, it was well over a thousand years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n Another said. \"He has a fine face, this old man. A noble face. Whoever\\n he is ... wherever he came from, he died bravely and he knew the way,\\n though he never reached this haven of the lost alive.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nor is it irony that he reached here dead,\" said the Lake Chieftain.\\n He had been listening and he stepped forward and raised his arm. \"He\\n was old. It is obvious that he fought bravely, that he had great\\n courage, and that he knew the way. He will be given a burial suitable\\n to his stature, and he will rest here among the brave.\\n\\n\\n \"Let the women dance and the music play for this old man. Let the\\n trumpets speak, and the rockets fly up. And let flowers be strewn over\\n the path above which the women will carry him to rest.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Next Kanad transfer ready. 1951. Reginald, son of Mr.\\n and Mrs. Martin Laughton, 3495 Orland Drive, Marionville,\\n Illinois, U. S. A. Arrive his 378th day. TB73782.\\nNancy Laughton sat on the blanket she had spread on the lawn in her\\n front yard, knitting a pair of booties for the PTA bazaar.\\n Occasionally she glanced at her son in the play pen, who was getting\\n his daily dose of sunshine. He was gurgling happily, examining a ball,\\n a cheese grater and a linen baby book, all with perfunctory interest.\\n\\n\\n When she looked up again she noticed a man walking by—except he\\n turned up the walk and crossed the lawn to her.\\n\\n\\n He was a little taller than her husband, had piercing blue eyes and a\\n rather amused set to his lips.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Nancy,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"Hello, Joe,\" she answered. It was her brother who lived in Kankakee.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going to take the baby for a while,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"All right, Joe.\"\\n\\n\\n He reached into the pen, picked up the baby. As he did so the baby\\'s\\n knees hit the side of the play pen and young Laughton let out a\\n scream—half from hurt and half from sudden lack of confidence in his\\n new handler. But this did not deter Joe. He started off with the\\n child.\\n\\n\\n Around the corner and after the man came a snarling mongrel dog, eyes\\n bright, teeth glinting in the sunlight. The man did not turn as the\\n dog threw himself at him, burying his teeth in his leg. Surprised, the\\n man dropped the screaming child on the lawn and turned to the dog. Joe\\n seemed off balance and he backed up confusedly in the face of the\\n snapping jaws. Then he suddenly turned and walked away, the dog at his\\n heels.\\n\\n\\n \"I tell you, the man said he was my brother and he made me think he\\n was,\" Nancy told her husband for the tenth time. \"I don\\'t even have a\\n brother.\"\\n\\n\\n Martin Laughton sighed. \"I can\\'t understand why you believed him. It\\'s\\n just—just plain nuts, Nancy!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t you think I know it?\" Nancy said tearfully. \"I feel like I\\'m\\n going crazy. I can\\'t say I dreamt it because there was Reggie with his\\n bleeding knees, squalling for all he was worth on the grass—Oh, I\\n don\\'t even want to think about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We haven\\'t lost Reggie, Nancy, remember that. Now why don\\'t you try\\n to get some rest?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You—you don\\'t believe me at all, do you, Martin?\"\\n\\n\\n When her husband did not answer, her head sank to her arms on the\\n table and she sobbed.\\n\\n\\n \"Nancy, for heaven\\'s sake, of course I believe you. I\\'m trying to\\n think it out, that\\'s all. We should have called the police.\"\\n\\n\\n Nancy shook her head in her arms. \"They\\'d—never—believe me either,\"\\n she moaned.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d better go and make sure Reggie\\'s all right.\" Martin got up out of\\n his chair and went to the stairs.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m going with you,\" Nancy said, hurriedly rising and coming over to\\n him.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll go up and look at him together.\"\\n\\n\\n They found Reggie peacefully asleep in his crib in his room upstairs.\\n They checked the windows and tucked in the blankets. They paused in\\n the room for a moment and then Martin stole his arm around his wife\\n and led her to the door.\\n\\n\\n \"As I\\'ve said, sergeant, this fellow hypnotized my wife. He made her\\n think he was her brother. She doesn\\'t even have a brother. Then he\\n tried to get away with the baby.\" Martin leaned down and patted the\\n dog. \"It was Tiger here who scared him off.\"\\n\\n\\n The police sergeant looked at the father, at Nancy and then at the\\n dog. He scribbled notes in his book.\\n\\n\\n \"Are you a rich man, Mr. Laughton?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Not at all. The bank still owns most of the house. I have a few\\n hundred dollars, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Office work, mostly. I\\'m a junior executive in an insurance company.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Any enemies?\"\\n\\n\\n \"No ... Oh, I suppose I have a few people I don\\'t get along with, like\\n anybody else. Nobody who\\'d do anything like this, though.\"\\n\\n\\n The sergeant flipped his notebook closed. \"You\\'d better keep your dog\\n inside and around the kid as much as possible. Keep your doors and\\n windows locked. I\\'ll see that the prowl car keeps an eye on the house.\\n Call us if anything seems unusual or out of the way.\"\\n\\n\\n Nancy had taken a sedative and was asleep by the time Martin finished\\n cleaning the .30-.30 rifle he used for deer hunting. He put it by the\\n stairs, ready for use, fully loaded, leaning it against the wall next\\n to the telephone stand.\\nThe front door bell rang. He answered it. It was Dr. Stuart and\\n another man.\\n\\n\\n \"I came as soon as I could, Martin,\" the young doctor said, stepping\\n inside with the other man. \"This is my new assistant, Dr. Tompkins.\"\\n\\n\\n Martin and Tompkins shook hands.\\n\\n\\n \"The baby—?\" Dr. Stuart asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Upstairs,\" Martin said.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better get him, Dr. Tompkins, if we\\'re to take him to the\\n hospital. I\\'ll stay here with Mr. Laughton. How\\'ve you been, Martin?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"How\\'s everything at the office?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Fine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And your wife?\"\\n\\n\\n \"She\\'s fine, too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Glad to hear it, Martin. Mighty glad. Say, by the way, there\\'s that\\n bill you owe me. I think it\\'s $32, isn\\'t that right?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I\\'d almost forgotten about it.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Why don\\'t you be a good fellow and write a check for it? It\\'s been\\n over a year, you know.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right. I\\'ll get right at it.\" Martin went over to his desk,\\n opened it and started looking for his checkbook. Dr. Stuart stood by\\n him, making idle comment until Dr. Tompkins came down the stairs with\\n the sleeping baby cuddled against his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind the check, now, Martin. I see we\\'re ready to go.\" He went\\n over to his assistant and took the baby. Together they walked out the\\n front door.\\n\\n\\n \"Good-bye,\" Martin said, going to the door.\\n\\n\\n Then he was nearly bowled over by the discharge of the .30-.30. Dr.\\n Stuart crumpled to the ground, the baby falling to the lawn. Dr.\\n Tompkins whirled and there was a second shot. Dr. Tompkins pitched\\n forward on his face.\\n\\n\\n The figure of a woman ran from the house, retrieved the now squalling\\n infant and ran back into the house. Once inside, Nancy slammed the\\n door, gave the baby to the stunned Martin and headed for the\\n telephone.\\n\\n\\n \"One of them was the same man!\" she cried.\\n\\n\\n Martin gasped, sinking into a chair with the baby. \"I believed them,\"\\n he said slowly and uncomprehendingly. \"They made me believe them!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Those bodies,\" the sergeant said. \"Would you mind pointing them out\\n to me, please?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Aren\\'t they—aren\\'t they on the walk?\" Mrs. Laughton asked.\\n\\n\\n \"There is nothing on the walk, Mrs. Laughton.\"\\n\\n\\n \"But there\\nmust\\nbe! I tell you I shot these men who posed as\\n doctors. One of them was the same man who tried to take the baby this\\n afternoon. They hypnotized my husband—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, I know, Mrs. Laughton. We\\'ve been through that.\" The sergeant\\n went to the door and opened it. \"Say, Homer, take another look around\\n the walk and the bushes. There\\'s supposed to be two of them. Shot with\\n a .30-.30.\"\\n\\n\\n He turned and picked up the gun and examined it again. \"Ever shoot a\\n gun before, Mrs. Laughton?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Many times. Martin and I used to go hunting together before we had\\n Reggie.\"\\n\\n\\n The sergeant nodded. \"You were taking an awful chance, shooting at a\\n guy carrying your baby, don\\'t you think?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I shot him in the legs. The other—the other turned and I shot him in\\n the chest. I could even see his eyes when he turned around. If I\\n hadn\\'t pulled the trigger then ... I don\\'t want to remember it.\"\\n\\n\\n The patrolman pushed the door open. \"There\\'s no bodies out here but\\n there\\'s some blood. Quite a lot of blood. A little to one side of the\\n walk.\"\\n\\n\\n The policemen went out.\\n\\n\\n \"Thank God you woke up, Nancy,\" Martin said. \"I\\'d have let them have\\n the baby.\" He reached over and smoothed the sleeping Reggie\\'s hair.\\n\\n\\n Nancy, who was rocking the boy, narrowed her eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"I wonder why they want our baby? He\\'s just like any other baby. We\\n don\\'t have any money. We couldn\\'t pay a ransom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Reggie\\'s pretty cute, though,\" Martin said. \"You will have to admit\\n that.\"\\n\\n\\n Nancy smiled. Then she suddenly stopped rocking.\\n\\n\\n \"Martin!\"\\n\\n\\n He sat up quickly.\\n\\n\\n \"Where\\'s Tiger?\"\\n\\n\\n Together they rose and walked around the room. They found him in a\\n corner, eyes open, tongue protruding. He was dead.\\nIf we keep Reggie in the house much longer he\\'ll turn out to be a\\n hermit,\" Martin said at breakfast a month later. \"He needs fresh air\\n and sunshine.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m not going to sit on the lawn alone with him, Martin. I just\\n can\\'t, that\\'s all. I\\'d be able to think of nothing but that day.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Still thinking about it? I think we\\'d have heard from them again if\\n they were coming back. They probably got somebody else\\'s baby by this\\n time.\" Martin finished his coffee and rose to kiss her good-bye. \"But\\n for safety\\'s sake I guess you\\'d better keep that gun handy.\"\\n\\n\\n The morning turned into a brilliant, sunshiny day. Puffs of clouds\\n moved slowly across the summer sky and a warm breeze rustled the\\n trees. It would be a crime to keep Reggie inside on a day like this,\\n Nancy thought.\\n\\n\\n So she called Mrs. MacDougal, the next door neighbor. Mrs. MacDougal\\n was familiar with what had happened to the Laughtons and she agreed to\\n keep an eye on Nancy and Reggie and to call the police at the first\\n sign of trouble.\\n\\n\\n With a fearful but determined heart Nancy moved the play pen and set\\n it up in the front yard. She spread a blanket for herself and put\\n Reggie in the pen. Her heart pounded all the while and she watched the\\n street for any strangers, ready to flee inside if need be. Reggie just\\n gurgled with delight at the change in environment.\\nThis peaceful scene was disturbed by a speeding car in which two men\\n were riding. The car roared up the street, swerved toward the parkway,\\n tires screaming, bounced over the curb and sidewalk, straight toward\\n the child and mother. Reggie, attracted by the sudden noise, looked up\\n to see the approaching vehicle. His mother stood up, set her palms\\n against her cheeks and shrieked.\\n\\n\\n The car came on, crunched over the play pen, killing the child. The\\n mother was hit and instantly killed, force of the blow snapping her\\n spine and tossing her against the house. The car plunged on into a\\n tree, hitting it a terrible blow, crumbling the car\\'s forward end so\\n it looked like an accordion. The men were thrown from the machine.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'ll never be able to prosecute in this case,\" the states attorney\\n said. \"At least not on a drunken driving basis.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I can\\'t get over it,\" the chief of police said. \"I\\'ve got at least\\n six men who will swear the man was drunk. He staggered, reeled and\\n gave the usual drunk talk. He reeked of whiskey.\"\\n\\n\\n The prosecutor handed the report over the desk. \"Here\\'s the analysis.\\n Not a trace of alcohol. He couldn\\'t have even had a smell of near\\n beer. Here\\'s another report. This is his physical exam made not long\\n afterwards. The man was in perfect health. Only variations are he had\\n a scar on his leg where something, probably a dog, bit him once. And\\n then a scar on his chest. It looked like an old gunshot wound, they\\n said. Must have happened years ago.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s odd. The man who accosted Mrs. Laughton in the afternoon was\\n bitten by their dog. Later that night she said she shot the same man\\n in the chest. Since the scars are healed it obviously couldn\\'t be the\\n same man. But there\\'s a real coincidence for you. And speaking of the\\n dogbite, the Laughton dog died that night. His menu evidently didn\\'t\\n agree with him. Never did figure what killed him, actually.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Any record of treatment on the man she shot?\"\\n\\n\\n \"The\\nmen\\n. You\\'ll remember, there were two. No, we never found a\\n trace of either. No doctor ever made a report of a gunshot wound that\\n night. No hospital had a case either—at least not within several\\n hundred miles—that night or several nights afterwards. Ever been shot\\n with .30-.30?\"\\n\\n\\n The state attorney shook his head. \"I wouldn\\'t be here if I had.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll say you wouldn\\'t. The pair must have crawled away to die God\\n knows where.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Getting back to the man who ran over the child and killed Mrs.\\n Laughton. Why did he pretend to be drunk?\"\\n\\n\\n It was the chief\\'s turn to shake his head. \"Your guess is as good as\\n mine. There are a lot of angles to this case none of us understand. It\\n looks deliberate, but where\\'s the motive?\"\\n\\n\\n \"What does the man have to say?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I was afraid you\\'d get to him,\" the chief said, his neck reddening.\\n \"It\\'s all been rather embarrassing to the department.\" He coughed\\n self-consciously. \"He\\'s proved a strange one, all right. He says his\\n name is John Smith and he\\'s got cards to prove it, too—for example, a\\n social security card. It looks authentic, yet there\\'s no such number\\n on file in Washington, so we\\'ve discovered. We\\'ve had him in jail for\\n a week and we\\'ve all taken turns questioning him. He laughs and admits\\n his guilt—in fact, he seems amused by most everything. Sometimes all\\n alone in his cell he\\'ll start laughing for no apparent reason. It\\n gives you the creeps.\"\\nThe states attorney leaned back in his chair. \"Maybe it\\'s a case for\\n an alienist.\"\\n\\n\\n \"One jump ahead of you. Dr. Stone thinks he\\'s normal, but won\\'t put\\n down any I.Q. Actually, he can\\'t figure him out himself. Smith seems\\n to take delight in answering questions—sort of anticipates them and\\n has the answer ready before you\\'re half through asking.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, if Dr. Stone says he\\'s normal, that\\'s enough for me.\" The\\n prosecutor was silent for a moment. Then, \"How about the husband?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Laughton? We\\'re afraid to let him see him. All broken up. No telling\\n what kind of a rumpus he\\'d start—especially if Smith started his\\n funny business.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Guess you\\'re right. Well, Mr. Smith won\\'t think it\\'s so funny when we\\n hang criminal negligence or manslaughter on him. By the way, you\\'ve\\n checked possible family connections?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nobody ever saw John Smith before. Even at the address on his\\n driver\\'s license. And there\\'s no duplicate of that in Springfield, in\\n case you\\'re interested.\"\\n\\n\\n The man who had laughingly told police his name was John Smith lay on\\n his cot in the county jail, his eyes closed, his arms folded across\\n his chest. This gave him the appearance of being alert despite\\n reclining. Even as he lay, his mouth held a hint of a smile.\\n\\n\\n Arvid 6—for John Smith\\nwas\\nArvid 6—had lain in that position for\\n more than four hours, when suddenly he snapped his eyes open and\\n appeared to be listening. For a moment a look of concern crossed his\\n face and he swung his legs to the floor and sat there expectantly.\\n Arvid 6 knew Tendal 13 had materialized and was somewhere in the\\n building.\\n\\n\\n Eventually there were some sounds from beyond the steel cell and\\n doorway. There was a clang when the outer doorway was opened and Arvid\\n 6 rose from his cot.\\n\\n\\n \"Your lawyer\\'s here to see you,\" the jailer said, indicating the man\\n with the brief case. \"Ring the buzzer when you\\'re through.\" The jailer\\n let the man in, locked the cell door and walked away.\\n\\n\\n The man threw the brief case on the jail cot and stood glaring.\\n\\n\\n \"Your damned foolishness has gone far enough. I\\'m sick and tired of\\n it,\" he declared. \"If you carry on any more we\\'ll never get back to\\n the Ultroom!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sorry, Tendal,\" the man on the cot said. \"I didn\\'t think—\"\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'re absolutely right. You didn\\'t think. Crashing that car into\\n that tree and killing that woman—that was the last straw. You don\\'t\\n even deserve to get back to our era. You ought to be made to rot\\n here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m\\nreally\\nsorry about that,\" Arvid 6 said.\\nYou know the instructions. Just because you work in the Ultroom don\\'t\\n get to thinking human life doesn\\'t have any value. We wouldn\\'t be here\\n if it hadn\\'t. But to unnecessarily kill—\" The older man shook his\\n head. \"You could have killed yourself as well and we\\'d never get the\\n job done. As it is, you almost totally obliterated me.\" Tendal 13\\n paced the length of the cell and back again, gesturing as he talked.\\n\\n\\n \"It was only with the greatest effort I pulled myself back together\\n again. I doubt that you could have done it. And then all the while\\n you\\'ve been sitting here, probably enjoying yourself with your special\\n brand of humor I have grown to despise.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You didn\\'t have to come along at all, you know,\" Arvid 6 said.\\n\\n\\n \"How well I know! How sorry I am that I ever did! It was only because\\n I was sorry for you, because someone older and more experienced than\\n you was needed. I volunteered. Imagine that! I volunteered! Tendal 13\\n reaches the height of stupidity and volunteers to help Arvid 6 go back\\n 6,000 years to bring Kanad back, to correct a mistake Arvid 6 made!\"\\n He snorted. \"I still can\\'t believe I was ever that stupid. I only\\n prove it when I pinch myself and here I am.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh, you\\'ve been a joy to be with! First it was that hunt in ancient\\n Mycenae when you let the lion escape the hunters\\' quaint spears and we\\n were partly eaten by the lion in the bargain, although you dazzled the\\n hunters, deflecting their spears. And then your zest for drink when we\\n were with Octavian in Alexandria that led to everybody\\'s amusement but\\n ours when we were ambushed by Anthony\\'s men. And worst of all, that\\n English barmaid you became engrossed with at our last stop in 1609,\\n when her husband mistook me for you and you let him take me apart\\n piece by piece—\"\\n\\n\\n \"All right, all right,\" Arvid 6 said. \"I\\'ll admit I\\'ve made some\\n mistakes. You\\'re just not adventurous, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Shut up! For once you\\'re going to listen to me. Our instructions\\n specifically stated we were to have as little as possible to do with\\n these people. But at every turn you\\'ve got us more and more enmeshed\\n with them. If that\\'s adventure, you can have it.\" Tendal 13 sat down\\n wearily and sank his head in his hands. \"It was you who conceived the\\n idea of taking Reggie right out of his play pen. \\'Watch me take that\\n child right out from under its mother\\'s nose\\' were your exact words.\\n And before I could stop you, you did. Only you forgot an important\\n factor in the equation—the dog, Tiger. And you nursed a dogbite most\\n of the afternoon before it healed. And then you took your spite out on\\n the poor thing by suggesting suffocation to it that night.\\n\\n\\n \"And speaking of that night, you remember we agreed I was to do the\\n talking. But no, you pulled a switch and captured Martin Laughton\\'s\\n attention. \\'I came as soon as I could, Martin,\\' you said. And suddenly\\n I played a very minor role. \\'This is my new assistant, Dr. Tompkins,\\'\\n you said. And then what happened? I get shot in the legs and you get a\\n hole in your back. We were both nearly obliterated that time and we\\n didn\\'t even come close to getting the child.\\n\\n\\n \"Still you wanted to run the whole show. \\'I\\'m younger than you,\\' you\\n said. \\'I\\'ll take the wheel.\\' And the next thing I know I\\'m floating in\\n space halfway to nowhere with two broken legs, a spinal injury,\\n concussion and some of the finest bruises you ever saw.\"\\nThese twentieth century machines aren\\'t what they ought to be,\" Arvid\\n 6 said.\\n\\n\\n \"You never run out of excuses, do you, Arvid? Remember what you said\\n in the Ultroom when you pushed the lever clear over and transferred\\n Kanad back 6,000 years? \\'My hand slipped.\\' As simple as that. \\'My hand\\n slipped.\\' It was so simple everyone believed you. You were given no\\n real punishment. In a way it was a reward—at least to you—getting to\\n go back and rescue the life germ of Kanad out of each era he\\'d be born\\n in.\"\\n\\n\\n Tendal 13 turned and looked steadily and directly at Arvid 6. \"Do you\\n know what I think? I think you deliberately pushed the lever over as\\n far as it would go\\njust to see what would happen\\n. That\\'s how simple\\n I think it was.\"\\n\\n\\n Arvid 6 flushed, turned away and looked at the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"What crazy things have you been doing since I\\'ve been gone?\" Tendal\\n 13 asked.\\n\\n\\n Arvid 6 sighed. \"After what you just said I guess it wouldn\\'t amuse\\n you, although it has me. They got to me right after the accident\\n before I had a chance to collect my wits, dematerialize or\\n anything—you said we shouldn\\'t dematerialize in front of anybody.\"\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I didn\\'t know what to do. I could see they thought I was drunk,\\n so I was. But they had a blood sample before I could manufacture any\\n alcohol in my blood, although I implanted a memory in them that I\\n reeked of it.\" He laughed. \"I fancy they\\'re thoroughly confused.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you\\'re thoroughly amused, no doubt. Have they questioned you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"At great length. They had a psychiatrist in to see me. He was a queer\\n fellow with the most stupid set of questions and tests I ever saw.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And you amused yourself with him.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I suppose you\\'d think so.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who do you tell them you are?\"\\n\\n\\n \"John Smith. A rather prevalent name here, I understand. I\\n manufactured a pasteboard called a social security card and a driver\\'s\\n license—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never mind. It\\'s easy to see you\\'ve been your own inimitable self.\\n Believe me, if I ever get back to the Ultroom I hope I never see you\\n again. And I hope I\\'ll never leave there again though I\\'m rejuvenated\\n through a million years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Was Kanad\\'s life germ transferred all right this time?\"\\n\\n\\n Tendal 13 shook his head. \"I haven\\'t heard. The transfers are getting\\n more difficult all the time. In 1609, you\\'ll remember, it was a case\\n of pneumonia for the two-year-old. A simple procedure. It wouldn\\'t\\n work here. Medicine\\'s too far along.\" He produced a notebook. \"The\\n last jump was 342 years, a little more than average. The next ought to\\n be around 2250. Things will be more difficult than ever there,\\n probably.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you think Kanad will be angry about all this?\"\\n\\n\\n \"How would you like to have to go through all those birth processes,\\n to have your life germ knocked from one era to the next?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Frankly, I didn\\'t think he\\'d go back so far.\"\\n\\n\\n \"If it had been anybody but Kanad nobody\\'d ever have thought of going\\n back after it. The life germ of the head of the whole galactic system\\n who came to the Ultroom to be transplanted to a younger body—and then\\n sending him back beyond his original birth date—\" Tendal 13 got up\\n and commenced his pacing again. \"Oh, I suppose Kanad\\'s partly to\\n blame, wanting rejuvenating at only 300 years. Some have waited a\\n thousand or more or until their bones are like paper.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I just wonder how angry Kanad will be,\" Arvid muttered.\\nHB92167. Ultroom Error. Tendal 13. Arvid 6.

Some people\\n said that no normal man could do\\n it, and mentioned the scar of a\\n ghastly head-wound to explain his\\n ability. One man partly guessed the\\n secret, but only partly. His name was\\n Sattell and he had reason not to\\n talk. Pop Young alone knew the\\n whole truth, and he kept his mouth\\n shut, too. It wasn\\'t anybody else\\'s\\n business.\\n\\n\\n The shack and the job he filled\\n were located in the medieval notion\\n of the physical appearance of hell.\\n By day the environment was heat and\\n torment. By night—lunar night, of\\n course, and lunar day—it was frigidity\\n and horror. Once in two weeks\\n Earth-time a rocketship came around\\n the horizon from Lunar City with\\n stores for the colony deep underground.\\n Pop received the stores and\\n took care of them. He handed over\\n the product of the mine, to be forwarded\\n to Earth. The rocket went\\n away again. Come nightfall Pop\\n lowered the supplies down the long\\n cable into the Big Crack to the colony\\n far down inside, and freshened up\\n the landing field marks with magnesium\\n marking-powder if a rocket-blast\\n had blurred them. That was\\n fundamentally all he had to do. But\\n without him the mine down in the\\n Crack would have had to shut\\n down.\\n\\n\\n The Crack, of course, was that\\n gaping rocky fault which stretches\\n nine hundred miles, jaggedly, over\\n the side of the Moon that Earth\\n never sees. There is one stretch where\\n it is a yawning gulf a full half-mile\\n wide and unguessably deep. Where\\n Pop Young\\'s shack stood it was only\\n a hundred yards, but the colony was\\n a full mile down, in one wall. There\\n is nothing like it on Earth, of course.\\n When it was first found, scientists\\n descended into it to examine the exposed\\n rock-strata and learn the history\\n of the Moon before its craters\\n were made. But they found more\\n than history. They found the reason\\n for the colony and the rocket landing\\n field and the shack.\\n\\n\\n The reason for Pop was something\\n else.\\n\\n\\n The shack stood a hundred feet\\n from the Big Crack\\'s edge. It looked\\n like a dust-heap thirty feet high, and\\n it was. The outside was surface\\n moondust, piled over a tiny dome to\\n be insulation against the cold of\\n night and shadow and the furnace\\n heat of day. Pop lived in it all alone,\\n and in his spare time he worked\\n industriously at recovering some\\n missing portions of his life that Sattell\\n had managed to take away from\\n him.\\n\\n\\n He thought often of Sattell, down\\n in the colony underground. There\\n were galleries and tunnels and living-quarters\\n down there. There were\\n air-tight bulkheads for safety, and a\\n hydroponic garden to keep the air\\n fresh, and all sorts of things to make\\n life possible for men under if not\\n on the Moon.\\n\\n\\n But it wasn\\'t fun, even underground.\\n In the Moon\\'s slight gravity,\\n a man is really adjusted to existence\\n when he has a well-developed case\\n of agoraphobia. With such an aid, a\\n man can get into a tiny, coffinlike\\n cubbyhole, and feel solidity above\\n and below and around him, and\\n happily tell himself that it feels delicious.\\n Sometimes it does.\\n\\n\\n But Sattell couldn\\'t comfort himself\\n so easily. He knew about Pop,\\n up on the surface. He\\'d shipped out,\\n whimpering, to the Moon to get far\\n away from Pop, and Pop was just\\n about a mile overhead and there was\\n no way to get around him. It was\\n difficult to get away from the mine,\\n anyhow. It doesn\\'t take too long for\\n the low gravity to tear a man\\'s\\n nerves to shreds. He has to develop\\n kinks in his head to survive. And\\n those kinks—\\n\\n\\n The first men to leave the colony\\n had to be knocked cold and shipped\\n out unconscious. They\\'d been underground—and\\n in low gravity—long\\n enough to be utterly unable to face\\n the idea of open spaces. Even now\\n there were some who had to be carried,\\n but there were some tougher\\n ones who were able to walk to the\\n rocketship if Pop put a tarpaulin\\n over their heads so they didn\\'t have\\n to see the sky. In any case Pop was\\n essential, either for carrying or\\n guidance.\\nSattell got the shakes when he\\n thought of Pop, and Pop rather\\n probably knew it. Of course, by the\\n time he took the job tending the\\n shack, he was pretty certain about\\n Sattell. The facts spoke for themselves.\\n\\n\\n Pop had come back to consciousness\\n in a hospital with a great\\n wound in his head and no memory\\n of anything that had happened before\\n that moment. It was not that his\\n identity was in question. When he\\n was stronger, the doctors told him\\n who he was, and as gently as possible\\n what had happened to his wife\\n and children. They\\'d been murdered\\n after he was seemingly killed defending\\n them. But he didn\\'t remember\\n a thing. Not then. It was\\n something of a blessing.\\n\\n\\n But when he was physically recovered\\n he set about trying to pick\\n up the threads of the life he could\\n no longer remember. He met Sattell\\n quite by accident. Sattell looked familiar.\\n Pop eagerly tried to ask him\\n questions. And Sattell turned gray\\n and frantically denied that he\\'d ever\\n seen Pop before.\\n\\n\\n All of which happened back on\\n Earth and a long time ago. It seemed\\n to Pop that the sight of Sattell had\\n brought back some vague and cloudy\\n memories. They were not sharp,\\n though, and he hunted up Sattell\\n again to find out if he was right.\\n And Sattell went into panic when\\n he returned.\\n\\n\\n Nowadays, by the Big Crack, Pop\\n wasn\\'t so insistent on seeing Sattell,\\n but he was deeply concerned with\\n the recovery of the memories that\\n Sattell helped bring back. Pop was\\n a highly conscientious man. He took\\n good care of his job. There was a\\n warning-bell in the shack, and when\\n a rocketship from Lunar City got\\n above the horizon and could send a\\n tight beam, the gong clanged loudly,\\n and Pop got into a vacuum-suit\\n and went out the air lock. He usually\\n reached the moondozer about the\\n time the ship began to brake for\\n landing, and he watched it come in.\\n\\n\\n He saw the silver needle in the\\n sky fighting momentum above a line\\n of jagged crater-walls. It slowed, and\\n slowed, and curved down as it drew\\n nearer. The pilot killed all forward\\n motion just above the field and came\\n steadily and smoothly down to land\\n between the silvery triangles that\\n marked the landing place.\\n\\n\\n Instantly the rockets cut off,\\n drums of fuel and air and food came\\n out of the cargo-hatch and Pop swept\\n forward with the dozer. It was a\\n miniature tractor with a gigantic\\n scoop in front. He pushed a great\\n mound of talc-fine dust before him\\n to cover up the cargo. It was necessary.\\n With freight costing what it\\n did, fuel and air and food came\\n frozen solid, in containers barely\\n thicker than foil. While they stayed\\n at space-shadow temperature, the foil\\n would hold anything. And a cover of\\n insulating moondust with vacuum\\n between the grains kept even air\\n frozen solid, though in sunlight.\\n\\n\\n At such times Pop hardly thought\\n of Sattell. He knew he had plenty\\n of time for that. He\\'d started to follow\\n Sattell knowing what had happened\\n to his wife and children, but\\n it was hearsay only. He had no memory\\n of them at all. But Sattell stirred\\n the lost memories. At first Pop followed\\n absorbedly from city to city,\\n to recover the years that had been\\n wiped out by an axe-blow. He did\\n recover a good deal. When Sattell\\n fled to another continent, Pop followed\\n because he had some distinct\\n memories of his wife—and the way\\n he\\'d felt about her—and some fugitive\\n mental images of his children.\\n When Sattell frenziedly tried to deny\\n knowledge of the murder in Tangier,\\n Pop had come to remember both his\\n children and some of the happiness\\n of his married life.\\n\\n\\n Even when Sattell—whimpering—signed\\n up for Lunar City, Pop tracked\\n him. By that time he was quite\\n sure that Sattell was the man who\\'d\\n killed his family. If so, Sattell had\\n profited by less than two days\\' pay\\n for wiping out everything that Pop\\n possessed. But Pop wanted it back.\\n He couldn\\'t prove Sattell\\'s guilt.\\n There was no evidence. In any case,\\n he didn\\'t really want Sattell to die.\\n If he did, there\\'d be no way to recover\\n more lost memories.\\n\\n\\n Sometimes, in the shack on the far\\n side of the Moon, Pop Young had\\n odd fancies about Sattell. There was\\n the mine, for example. In each two\\n Earth-weeks of working, the mine-colony\\n nearly filled up a three-gallon\\n cannister with greasy-seeming white\\n crystals shaped like two pyramids\\n base to base. The filled cannister\\n would weigh a hundred pounds on\\n Earth. Here it weighed eighteen. But\\n on Earth its contents would be computed\\n in carats, and a hundred\\n pounds was worth millions. Yet here\\n on the Moon Pop kept a waiting cannister\\n on a shelf in his tiny dome,\\n behind the air-apparatus. It rattled\\n if he shook it, and it was worth no\\n more than so many pebbles. But\\n sometimes Pop wondered if Sattell\\n ever thought of the value of the\\n mine\\'s production. If he would kill\\n a woman and two children and think\\n he\\'d killed a man for no more than\\n a hundred dollars, what enormity\\n would he commit for a three-gallon\\n quantity of uncut diamonds?\\nBut he did not dwell on such\\n speculation. The sun rose very, very\\n slowly in what by convention was\\n called the east. It took nearly two\\n hours to urge its disk above the\\n horizon, and it burned terribly in\\n emptiness for fourteen times twenty-four\\n hours before sunset. Then there\\n was night, and for three hundred\\n and thirty-six consecutive hours there\\n were only stars overhead and the\\n sky was a hole so terrible that a man\\n who looked up into it—what with\\n the nagging sensation of one-sixth\\n gravity—tended to lose all confidence\\n in the stability of things. Most men\\n immediately found it hysterically necessary\\n to seize hold of something\\n solid to keep from falling upward.\\n But nothing felt solid. Everything\\n fell, too. Wherefore most men tended\\n to scream.\\n\\n\\n But not Pop. He\\'d come to the\\n Moon in the first place because Sattell\\n was here. Near Sattell, he found\\n memories of times when he was a\\n young man with a young wife who\\n loved him extravagantly. Then pictures\\n of his children came out of\\n emptiness and grew sharp and clear.\\n He found that he loved them very\\n dearly. And when he was near Sattell\\n he literally recovered them—in\\n the sense that he came to know new\\n things about them and had new\\n memories of them every day. He\\n hadn\\'t yet remembered the crime\\n which lost them to him. Until he\\n did—and the fact possessed a certain\\n grisly humor—Pop didn\\'t even hate\\n Sattell. He simply wanted to be near\\n him because it enabled him to recover\\n new and vivid parts of his\\n youth that had been lost.\\n\\n\\n Otherwise, he was wholly matter-of-fact—certainly\\n so for the far side\\n of the Moon. He was a rather fussy\\n housekeeper. The shack above the\\n Big Crack\\'s rim was as tidy as any\\n lighthouse or fur-trapper\\'s cabin. He\\n tended his air-apparatus with a fine\\n precision. It was perfectly simple. In\\n the shadow of the shack he had an\\n unfailing source of extreme low\\n temperature. Air from the shack\\n flowed into a shadow-chilled pipe.\\n Moisture condensed out of it here,\\n and CO\\n 2\\n froze solidly out of it there,\\n and on beyond it collected as restless,\\n transparent liquid air. At the same\\n time, liquid air from another tank\\n evaporated to maintain the proper\\n air pressure in the shack. Every so\\n often Pop tapped the pipe where the\\n moisture froze, and lumps of water\\n ice clattered out to be returned to the\\n humidifier. Less often he took out the\\n CO\\n 2\\n snow, and measured it, and\\n dumped an equivalent quantity of\\n pale-blue liquid oxygen into the liquid\\n air that had been purified by\\n cold. The oxygen dissolved. Then the\\n apparatus reversed itself and supplied\\n fresh air from the now-enriched\\n fluid, while the depleted other\\n tank began to fill up with cold-purified\\n liquid air.\\n\\n\\n Outside the shack, jagged stony\\n pinnacles reared in the starlight, and\\n craters complained of the bombardment\\n from space that had made them.\\n But, outside, nothing ever happened.\\n Inside, it was quite different.\\n\\n\\n Working on his memories, one\\n day Pop made a little sketch. It\\n helped a great deal. He grew deeply\\n interested. Writing-material was\\n scarce, but he spent most of the time\\n between two particular rocket-landings\\n getting down on paper exactly\\n how a child had looked while sleeping,\\n some fifteen years before. He\\n remembered with astonishment that\\n the child had really looked exactly\\n like that! Later he began a sketch of\\n his partly-remembered wife. In time—he\\n had plenty—it became a really\\n truthful likeness.\\n\\n\\n The sun rose, and baked the\\n abomination of desolation which was\\n the moonscape. Pop Young meticulously\\n touched up the glittering\\n triangles which were landing guides\\n for the Lunar City ships. They glittered\\n from the thinnest conceivable\\n layer of magnesium marking-powder.\\n He checked over the moondozer.\\n He tended the air apparatus. He did\\n everything that his job and survival\\n required. Ungrudgingly.\\n\\n\\n Then he made more sketches. The\\n images to be drawn came back more\\n clearly when he thought of Sattell,\\n so by keeping Sattell in mind he recovered\\n the memory of a chair that\\n had been in his forgotten home.\\n Then he drew his wife sitting in it,\\n reading. It felt very good to see her\\n again. And he speculated about\\n whether Sattell ever thought of millions\\n of dollars\\' worth of new-mined\\n diamonds knocking about unguarded\\n in the shack, and he suddenly recollected\\n clearly the way one of his\\n children had looked while playing\\n with her doll. He made a quick\\n sketch to keep from forgetting that.\\n\\n\\n There was no purpose in the\\n sketching, save that he\\'d lost all his\\n young manhood through a senseless\\n crime. He wanted his youth back. He\\n was recovering it bit by bit. The\\n occupation made it absurdly easy to\\n live on the surface of the far side of\\n the Moon, whether anybody else\\n could do it or not.\\n\\n\\n Sattell had no such device for adjusting\\n to the lunar state of things.\\n Living on the Moon was bad enough\\n anyhow, then, but living one mile\\n underground from Pop Young was\\n much worse. Sattell clearly remembered\\n the crime Pop Young hadn\\'t\\n yet recalled. He considered that Pop\\n had made no overt attempt to revenge\\n himself because he planned\\n some retaliation so horrible and lingering\\n that it was worth waiting for.\\n He came to hate Pop with an insane\\n ferocity. And fear. In his mind the\\n need to escape became an obsession\\n on top of the other psychotic states\\n normal to a Moon-colonist.\\n\\n\\n But he was helpless. He couldn\\'t\\n leave. There was Pop. He couldn\\'t\\n kill Pop. He had no chance—and he\\n was afraid. The one absurd, irrelevant\\n thing he could do was write\\n letters back to Earth. He did that.\\n He wrote with the desperate, impassioned,\\n frantic blend of persuasion\\n and information and genius-like invention\\n of a prisoner in a high-security\\n prison, trying to induce someone\\n to help him escape.\\n\\n\\n He had friends, of a sort, but for\\n a long time his letters produced\\n nothing. The Moon swung in vast\\n circles about the Earth, and the Earth\\n swung sedately about the Sun. The\\n other planets danced their saraband.\\n The rest of humanity went about its\\n own affairs with fascinated attention.\\n But then an event occurred which\\n bore directly upon Pop Young and\\n Sattell and Pop Young\\'s missing\\n years.\\n\\n\\n Somebody back on Earth promoted\\n a luxury passenger-line of spaceships\\n to ply between Earth and\\n Moon. It looked like a perfect set-up.\\n Three spacecraft capable of the journey\\n came into being with attendant\\n reams of publicity. They promised a\\n thrill and a new distinction for the\\n rich. Guided tours to Lunar! The\\n most expensive and most thrilling\\n trip in history! One hundred thousand\\n dollars for a twelve-day cruise\\n through space, with views of the\\n Moon\\'s far side and trips through\\n Lunar City and a landing in Aristarchus,\\n plus sound-tapes of the journey\\n and fame hitherto reserved for\\n honest explorers!\\n\\n\\n It didn\\'t seem to have anything\\n to do with Pop or with Sattell. But\\n it did.\\n\\n\\n There were just two passenger\\n tours. The first was fully booked.\\n But the passengers who paid so highly,\\n expected to be pleasantly thrilled\\n and shielded from all reasons for\\n alarm. And they couldn\\'t be. Something\\n happens when a self-centered\\n and complacent individual unsuspectingly\\n looks out of a spaceship\\n port and sees the cosmos unshielded\\n by mists or clouds or other aids to\\n blindness against reality. It is shattering.\\n\\n\\n A millionaire cut his throat when\\n he saw Earth dwindled to a mere\\n blue-green ball in vastness. He could\\n not endure his own smallness in the\\n face of immensity. Not one passenger\\n disembarked even for Lunar\\n City. Most of them cowered in their\\n chairs, hiding their eyes. They were\\n the simple cases of hysteria. But the\\n richest girl on Earth, who\\'d had five\\n husbands and believed that nothing\\n could move her—she went into\\n catatonic withdrawal and neither\\n saw nor heard nor moved. Two other\\n passengers sobbed in improvised\\n strait jackets. The first shipload\\n started home. Fast.\\n\\n\\n The second luxury liner took off\\n with only four passengers and turned\\n back before reaching the Moon.\\n Space-pilots could take the strain of\\n space-flight because they had work\\n to do. Workers for the lunar mines\\n could make the trip under heavy\\n sedation. But it was too early in the\\n development of space-travel for\\n pleasure-passengers. They weren\\'t\\n prepared for the more humbling\\n facts of life.\\n\\n\\n Pop heard of the quaint commercial\\n enterprise through the micro-tapes\\n put off at the shack for the men\\n down in the mine. Sattell probably\\n learned of it the same way. Pop didn\\'t\\n even think of it again. It seemed\\n to have nothing to do with him. But\\n Sattell undoubtedly dealt with it\\n fully in his desperate writings back\\n to Earth.\\nPop matter-of-factly tended the\\n shack and the landing field and the\\n stores for the Big Crack mine. Between-times\\n he made more drawings\\n in pursuit of his own private objective.\\n Quite accidentally, he developed\\n a certain talent professional artists\\n might have approved. But he was not\\n trying to communicate, but to discover.\\n Drawing—especially with his\\n mind on Sattell—he found fresh incidents\\n popping up in his recollection.\\n Times when he was happy. One\\n day he remembered the puppy his\\n children had owned and loved. He\\n drew it painstakingly—and it was\\n his again. Thereafter he could remember\\n it any time he chose. He did\\n actually recover a completely vanished\\n past.\\n\\n\\n He envisioned a way to increase\\n that recovery. But there was a marked\\n shortage of artists\\' materials on the\\n Moon. All freight had to be hauled\\n from Earth, on a voyage equal to\\n rather more than a thousand times\\n around the equator of the Earth.\\n Artists\\' supplies were not often included.\\n Pop didn\\'t even ask.\\n\\n\\n He began to explore the area outside\\n the shack for possible material\\n no one would think of sending from\\n Earth. He collected stones of various\\n sorts, but when warmed up in the\\n shack they were useless. He found\\n no strictly lunar material which\\n would serve for modeling or carving\\n portraits in the ground. He found\\n minerals which could be pulverized\\n and used as pigments, but nothing\\n suitable for this new adventure in\\n the recovery of lost youth. He even\\n considered blasting, to aid his search.\\n He could. Down in the mine, blasting\\n was done by soaking carbon black—from\\n CO\\n 2\\n —in liquid oxygen, and then\\n firing it with a spark. It exploded\\n splendidly. And its fumes were\\n merely more CO\\n 2\\n which an air-apparatus\\n handled easily.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t do any blasting. He didn\\'t\\n find any signs of the sort of\\n mineral he required. Marble would\\n have been perfect, but there is no\\n marble on the Moon. Naturally! Yet\\n Pop continued to search absorbedly\\n for material with which to capture\\n memory. Sattell still seemed necessary,\\n but—\\n\\n\\n Early one lunar morning he was\\n a good two miles from his shack\\n when he saw rocket-fumes in the\\n sky. It was most unlikely. He wasn\\'t\\n looking for anything of the sort, but\\n out of the corner of his eye he observed\\n that something moved. Which\\n was impossible. He turned his head,\\n and there were rocket-fumes coming\\n over the horizon, not in the direction\\n of Lunar City. Which was more\\n impossible still.\\n\\n\\n He stared. A tiny silver rocket to\\n the westward poured out monstrous\\n masses of vapor. It decelerated swiftly.\\n It curved downward. The rockets\\n checked for an instant, and flamed\\n again more violently, and checked\\n once more. This was not an expert\\n approach. It was a faulty one. Curving\\n surface-ward in a sharply changing\\n parabola, the pilot over-corrected\\n and had to wait to gather down-speed,\\n and then over-corrected again.\\n It was an altogether clumsy landing.\\n The ship was not even perfectly vertical\\n when it settled not quite in the\\n landing-area marked by silvery triangles.\\n One of its tail-fins crumpled\\n slightly. It tilted a little when fully\\n landed.\\n\\n\\n Then nothing happened.\\n\\n\\n Pop made his way toward it in\\n the skittering, skating gait one uses\\n in one-sixth gravity. When he was\\n within half a mile, an air-lock door\\n opened in the ship\\'s side. But nothing\\n came out of the lock. No space-suited\\n figure. No cargo came drifting\\n down with the singular deliberation\\n of falling objects on the Moon.\\n\\n\\n It was just barely past lunar sunrise\\n on the far side of the Moon.\\n Incredibly long and utterly black\\n shadows stretched across the plain,\\n and half the rocketship was dazzling\\n white and half was blacker than\\n blackness itself. The sun still hung\\n low indeed in the black, star-speckled\\n sky. Pop waded through moondust,\\n raising a trail of slowly settling\\n powder. He knew only that the ship\\n didn\\'t come from Lunar City, but\\n from Earth. He couldn\\'t imagine\\n why. He did not even wildly connect\\n it with what—say—Sattell might\\n have written with desperate plausibility\\n about greasy-seeming white\\n crystals out of the mine, knocking\\n about Pop Young\\'s shack in cannisters\\n containing a hundred Earth-pounds\\n weight of richness.\\nPop reached the rocketship. He\\n approached the big tail-fins. On one\\n of them there were welded ladder-rungs\\n going up to the opened air-lock\\n door.\\n\\n\\n He climbed.\\n\\n\\n The air-lock was perfectly normal\\n when he reached it. There was a\\n glass port in the inner door, and he\\n saw eyes looking through it at him.\\n He pulled the outer door shut and\\n felt the whining vibration of admitted\\n air. His vacuum suit went slack\\n about him. The inner door began to\\n open, and Pop reached up and gave\\n his helmet the practiced twisting\\n jerk which removed it.\\n\\n\\n Then he blinked. There was a red-headed\\n man in the opened door. He\\n grinned savagely at Pop. He held a\\n very nasty hand-weapon trained on\\n Pop\\'s middle.\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t come in!\" he said mockingly.\\n \"And I don\\'t give a damn\\n about how you are. This isn\\'t social.\\n It\\'s business!\"\\n\\n\\n Pop simply gaped. He couldn\\'t\\n quite take it in.\\n\\n\\n \"This,\" snapped the red-headed\\n man abruptly, \"is a stickup!\"\\n\\n\\n Pop\\'s eyes went through the inner\\n lock-door. He saw that the interior\\n of the ship was stripped and bare.\\n But a spiral stairway descended from\\n some upper compartment. It had a\\n handrail of pure, transparent, water-clear\\n plastic. The walls were bare insulation,\\n but that trace of luxury remained.\\n Pop gazed at the plastic,\\n fascinated.\\n\\n\\n The red-headed man leaned forward,\\n snarling. He slashed Pop\\n across the face with the barrel of his\\n weapon. It drew blood. It was wanton,\\n savage brutality.\\n\\n\\n \"Pay attention!\" snarled the red-headed\\n man. \"A stickup, I said! Get\\n it? You go get that can of stuff\\n from the mine! The diamonds!\\n Bring them here! Understand?\"\\n\\n\\n Pop said numbly: \"What the\\n hell?\"\\n\\n\\n The red-headed man hit him\\n again. He was nerve-racked, and,\\n therefore, he wanted to hurt.\\n\\n\\n \"Move!\" he rasped. \"I want the\\n diamonds you\\'ve got for the ship\\n from Lunar City! Bring \\'em!\" Pop\\n licked blood from his lips and the\\n man with the weapon raged at him.\\n \"Then phone down to the mine!\\n Tell Sattell I\\'m here and he can\\n come on up! Tell him to bring any\\n more diamonds they\\'ve dug up since\\n the stuff you\\'ve got!\"\\n\\n\\n He leaned forward. His face was\\n only inches from Pop Young\\'s. It\\n was seamed and hard-bitten and\\n nerve-racked. But any man would be\\n quivering if he wasn\\'t used to space\\n or the feel of one-sixth gravity on\\n the Moon. He panted:\\n\\n\\n \"And get it straight! You try\\n any tricks and we take off! We\\n swing over your shack! The rocket-blast\\n smashes it! We burn you\\n down! Then we swing over the cable\\n down to the mine and the rocket-flame\\n melts it! You die and everybody\\n in the mine besides! No tricks!\\n We didn\\'t come here for nothing!\"\\n\\n\\n He twitched all over. Then he\\n struck cruelly again at Pop Young\\'s\\n face. He seemed filled with fury, at\\n least partly hysterical. It was the tension\\n that space-travel—then, at its\\n beginning—produced. It was meaningless\\n savagery due to terror. But,\\n of course, Pop was helpless to resent\\n it. There were no weapons on the\\n Moon and the mention of Sattell\\'s\\n name showed the uselessness of bluff.\\n He\\'d pictured the complete set-up\\n by the edge of the Big Crack. Pop\\n could do nothing.\\n\\n\\n The red-headed man checked\\n himself, panting. He drew back and\\n slammed the inner lock-door. There\\n was the sound of pumping.\\n\\n\\n Pop put his helmet back on and\\n sealed it. The outer door opened.\\n Outrushing air tugged at Pop. After\\n a second or two he went out and\\n climbed down the welded-on ladder-bars\\n to the ground.\\n\\n\\n He headed back toward his shack.\\n Somehow, the mention of Sattell had\\n made his mind work better. It always\\n did. He began painstakingly to\\n put things together. The red-headed\\n man knew the routine here in every\\n detail. He knew Sattell. That part\\n was simple. Sattell had planned this\\n multi-million-dollar coup, as a man\\n in prison might plan his break. The\\n stripped interior of the ship identified\\n it.\\n\\n\\n It was one of the unsuccessful\\n luxury-liners sold for scrap. Or perhaps\\n it was stolen for the journey\\n here. Sattell\\'s associates had had to\\n steal or somehow get the fuel, and\\n somehow find a pilot. But there were\\n diamonds worth at least five million\\n dollars waiting for them, and the\\n whole job might not have called for\\n more than two men—with Sattell as\\n a third. According to the economics\\n of crime, it was feasible. Anyhow it\\n was being done.\\n\\n\\n Pop reached the dust-heap which\\n was his shack and went in the air\\n lock. Inside, he went to the vision-phone\\n and called the mine-colony\\n down in the Crack. He gave the\\n message he\\'d been told to pass on.\\n Sattell to come up, with what diamonds\\n had been dug since the\\n regular cannister was sent up for the\\n Lunar City ship that would be due\\n presently. Otherwise the ship on the\\n landing strip would destroy shack\\n and Pop and the colony together.\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'d guess,\" said Pop painstakingly,\\n \"that Sattell figured it out. He\\'s\\n probably got some sort of gun to\\n keep you from holding him down\\n there. But he won\\'t know his friends\\n are here—not right this minute he\\n won\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n A shaking voice asked questions\\n from the vision-phone.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" said Pop, \"they\\'ll do it anyhow.\\n If we were able to tell about\\n \\'em, they\\'d be chased. But if I\\'m\\n dead and the shacks smashed and\\n the cable burnt through, they\\'ll be\\n back on Earth long before a new\\n cable\\'s been got and let down to you.\\n So they\\'ll do all they can no matter\\n what I do.\" He added, \"I wouldn\\'t\\n tell Sattell a thing about it, if I were\\n you. It\\'ll save trouble. Just let him\\n keep on waiting for this to happen.\\n It\\'ll save you trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n Another shaky question.\\n\\n\\n \"Me?\" asked Pop. \"Oh, I\\'m going\\n to raise what hell I can. There\\'s\\n some stuff in that ship I want.\"\\n\\n\\n He switched off the phone. He\\n went over to his air apparatus. He\\n took down the cannister of diamonds\\n which were worth five millions or\\n more back on Earth. He found a\\n bucket. He dumped the diamonds\\n casually into it. They floated downward\\n with great deliberation and\\n surged from side to side like a liquid\\n when they stopped. One-sixth gravity.\\n\\n\\n Pop regarded his drawings meditatively.\\n A sketch of his wife as he\\n now remembered her. It was very\\n good to remember. A drawing of his\\n two children, playing together. He\\n looked forward to remembering\\n much more about them. He grinned.\\n\\n\\n \"That stair-rail,\" he said in deep\\n satisfaction. \"That\\'ll do it!\"\\n\\n\\n He tore bed linen from his bunk\\n and worked on the emptied cannister.\\n It was a double container with a\\n thermware interior lining. Even on\\n Earth newly-mined diamonds sometimes\\n fly to pieces from internal\\n stress. On the Moon, it was not desirable\\n that diamonds be exposed to\\n repeated violent changes of temperature.\\n So a thermware-lined cannister\\n kept them at mine-temperature once\\n they were warmed to touchability.\\n\\n\\n Pop packed the cotton cloth in the\\n container. He hurried a little, because\\n the men in the rocket were shaky and\\n might not practice patience. He took\\n a small emergency-lamp from his\\n spare spacesuit. He carefully cracked\\n its bulb, exposing the filament within.\\n He put the lamp on top of the\\n cotton and sprinkled magnesium\\n marking-powder over everything.\\n Then he went to the air-apparatus\\n and took out a flask of the liquid\\n oxygen used to keep his breathing-air\\n in balance. He poured the frigid,\\n pale-blue stuff into the cotton. He\\n saturated it.\\n\\n\\n All the inside of the shack was\\n foggy when he finished. Then he\\n pushed the cannister-top down. He\\n breathed a sigh of relief when it was\\n in place. He\\'d arranged for it to\\n break a frozen-brittle switch as it\\n descended. When it came off, the\\n switch would light the lamp with its\\n bare filament. There was powdered\\n magnesium in contact with it and\\n liquid oxygen all about.\\n\\n\\n He went out of the shack by the\\n air lock. On the way, thinking about\\n Sattell, he suddenly recovered a completely\\n new memory. On their first\\n wedding anniversary, so long ago,\\n he and his wife had gone out to\\n dinner to celebrate. He remembered\\n how she looked: the almost-smug\\n joy they shared that they would be\\n together for always, with one complete\\n year for proof.\\n\\n\\n Pop reflected hungrily that it was\\n something else to be made permanent\\n and inspected from time to time.\\n But he wanted more than a drawing\\n of this! He wanted to make the memory\\n permanent and to extend it—\\n\\n\\n If it had not been for his vacuum\\n suit and the cannister he carried, Pop\\n would have rubbed his hands.\\nTall, jagged crater-walls rose\\n from the lunar plain. Monstrous, extended\\n inky shadows stretched\\n enormous distances, utterly black.\\n The sun, like a glowing octopod,\\n floated low at the edge of things and\\n seemed to hate all creation.\\n\\n\\n Pop reached the rocket. He\\n climbed the welded ladder-rungs to\\n the air lock. He closed the door. Air\\n whined. His suit sagged against his\\n body. He took off his helmet.\\n\\n\\n When the red-headed man opened\\n the inner door, the hand-weapon\\n shook and trembled. Pop said\\n calmly:\\n\\n\\n \"Now I\\'ve got to go handle the\\n hoist, if Sattell\\'s coming up from\\n the mine. If I don\\'t do it, he don\\'t\\n come up.\"\\n\\n\\n The red-headed man snarled. But\\n his eyes were on the cannister whose\\n contents should weigh a hundred\\n pounds on Earth.\\n\\n\\n \"Any tricks,\" he rasped, \"and you\\n know what happens!\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Pop.\\n\\n\\n He stolidly put his helmet back\\n on. But his eyes went past the red-headed\\n man to the stair that wound\\n down, inside the ship, from some\\n compartment above. The stair-rail was\\n pure, clear, water-white plastic, not\\n less than three inches thick. There\\n was a lot of it!\\n\\n\\n The inner door closed. Pop opened\\n the outer. Air rushed out. He\\n climbed painstakingly down to the\\n ground. He started back toward the\\n shack.\\n\\n\\n There was the most luridly bright\\n of all possible flashes. There was no\\n sound, of course. But something\\n flamed very brightly, and the ground\\n thumped under Pop Young\\'s vacuum\\n boots. He turned.\\n\\n\\n The rocketship was still in the act\\n of flying apart. It had been a splendid\\n explosion. Of course cotton sheeting\\n in liquid oxygen is not quite as\\n good an explosive as carbon-black,\\n which they used down in the mine.\\n Even with magnesium powder to\\n start the flame when a bare light-filament\\n ignited it, the cannister-bomb\\n hadn\\'t equaled—say—T.N.T.\\n But the ship had fuel on board for\\n the trip back to Earth. And it blew,\\n too. It would be minutes before all\\n the fragments of the ship returned\\n to the Moon\\'s surface. On the Moon,\\n things fall slowly.\\n\\n\\n Pop didn\\'t wait. He searched\\n hopefully. Once a mass of steel plating\\n fell only yards from him, but it\\n did not interrupt his search.\\n\\n\\n When he went into the shack, he\\n grinned to himself. The call-light of\\n the vision-phone flickered wildly.\\n When he took off his helmet the bell\\n clanged incessantly. He answered. A\\n shaking voice from the mining-colony\\n panted:\\n\\n\\n \"We felt a shock! What happened?\\n What do we do?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t do a thing,\" advised Pop.\\n \"It\\'s all right. I blew up the ship and\\n everything\\'s all right. I wouldn\\'t\\n even mention it to Sattell if I were\\n you.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned happily down at a section\\n of plastic stair-rail he\\'d found\\n not too far from where the ship exploded.\\n When the man down in the\\n mine cut off, Pop got out of his\\n vacuum suit in a hurry. He placed\\n the plastic zestfully on the table\\n where he\\'d been restricted to drawing\\n pictures of his wife and children\\n in order to recover memories of\\n them.\\n\\n\\n He began to plan, gloatingly, the\\n thing he would carve out of a four-inch\\n section of the plastic. When it\\n was carved, he\\'d paint it. While he\\n worked, he\\'d think of Sattell, because\\n that was the way to get back the\\n missing portions of his life—the\\n parts Sattell had managed to get\\n away from him. He\\'d get back more\\n than ever, now!\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t wonder what he\\'d do\\n if he ever remembered the crime\\n Sattell had committed. He felt, somehow,\\n that he wouldn\\'t get that back\\n until he\\'d recovered all the rest.\\n\\n\\n Gloating, it was amusing to remember\\n what people used to call\\n such art-works as he planned, when\\n carved by other lonely men in other\\n faraway places. They called those\\n sculptures scrimshaw.\\n\\n\\n But they were a lot more than\\n that!\\nTHE END\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\nThis etext was produced from\\nAstounding Science Fiction\\nSeptember\\n 1955.

Bright sunlight\\n slanted in through one wall, on the\\n blue knapsack across his shoulders.\\n Who he was, and what he was doing\\n here, was clouded. The truth lurked\\n in some corner of his consciousness,\\n but it was not reached by surface\\n awareness.\\n\\n\\n The corridor opened at last into\\n a large high-domed room, much\\n like a railway station or an air terminal.\\n He walked straight ahead.\\n\\n\\n At the sight of him a man leaning\\n negligently against a stone pillar,\\n to his right but within vision,\\n straightened and barked an order\\n to him, “Halt!” He lengthened his\\n stride but gave no other sign.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 136\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Two men hurried through a\\n doorway of a small anteroom to his\\n left, calling to him. He turned away\\n and began to run.\\n\\n\\n Shouts and the sound of charging\\n feet came from behind him. He\\n cut to the right, running toward the\\n escalator to the second floor. Another\\n pair of men were hurrying\\n down, two steps at a stride. With\\n no break in pace he veered into an\\n opening beside the escalator.\\n\\n\\n At the first turn he saw that the\\n aisle merely circled the stairway,\\n coming out into the depot again on\\n the other side. It was a trap. He\\n glanced quickly around him.\\n\\n\\n At the rear of the space was a\\n row of lockers for traveler use. He\\n slipped a coin into a pay slot,\\n opened the zipper on his bag and\\n pulled out a flat briefcase. It took\\n him only a few seconds to push the\\n case into the compartment, lock it\\n and slide the key along the floor\\n beneath the locker.\\n\\n\\n There was nothing to do after\\n that—except wait.\\n\\n\\n The men pursuing him came\\n hurtling around the turn in the\\n aisle. He kicked his knapsack to\\n one side, spreading his feet wide\\n with an instinctive motion.\\n\\n\\n Until that instant he had intended\\n to fight. Now he swiftly\\n reassessed the odds. There were\\n five of them, he saw. He should be\\n able to incapacitate two or three\\n and break out. But the fact that\\n they had been expecting him meant\\n that others would very probably\\n be waiting outside. His best course\\n now was to sham ignorance. He\\n relaxed.\\n\\n\\n He offered no resistance as they\\n reached him.\\n\\n\\n They were not gentle men. A tall\\n ruffian, copper-brown face damp\\n with perspiration and body oil,\\n grabbed him by the jacket and\\n slammed him back against the\\n lockers. As he shifted his weight\\n to keep his footing someone drove\\n a fist into his face. He started to\\n raise his hands; and a hard flat\\n object crashed against the side of\\n his skull.\\n\\n\\n The starch went out of his legs.\\n“D\\n O you make anything out of\\n it?” the psychoanalyst Milton\\n Bergstrom, asked.\\n\\n\\n John Zarwell shook his head.\\n “Did I talk while I was under?”\\n\\n\\n “Oh, yes. You were supposed to.\\n That way I follow pretty well what\\n you’re reenacting.”\\n\\n\\n “How does it tie in with what I\\n told you before?”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom’s neat-boned, fair-skinned\\n face betrayed no emotion\\n other than an introspective stillness\\n of his normally alert gaze. “I see\\n no connection,” he decided, his\\n words once again precise and meticulous.\\n “We don’t have enough to\\n go on. Do you feel able to try another\\n comanalysis this afternoon\\n yet?”\\n\\n\\n “I don’t see why not.” Zarwell\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 137\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n opened the collar of his shirt. The\\n day was hot, and the room had no\\n air conditioning, still a rare luxury\\n on St. Martin’s. The office window\\n was open, but it let in no freshness,\\n only the mildly rank odor that pervaded\\n all the planet’s habitable\\n area.\\n\\n\\n “Good.” Bergstrom rose. “The\\n serum is quite harmless, John.” He\\n maintained a professional diversionary\\n chatter as he administered\\n the drug. “A scopolamine derivative\\n that’s been well tested.”\\n\\n\\n The floor beneath Zarwell’s feet\\n assumed abruptly the near transfluent\\n consistency of a damp\\n sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave\\n and rolled gently toward the far\\n wall.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom continued talking,\\n with practiced urbanity. “When\\n psychiatry was a less exact science,”\\n his voice went on, seeming to come\\n from a great distance, “a doctor\\n had to spend weeks, sometimes\\n months or years interviewing a\\n patient. If he was skilled enough,\\n he could sort the relevancies from\\n the vast amount of chaff. We are\\n able now, with the help of the\\n serum, to confine our discourses to\\n matters cogent to the patient’s\\n trouble.”\\n\\n\\n The floor continued its transmutation,\\n and Zarwell sank deep into\\n viscous depths. “Lie back and relax.\\n Don’t\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n The words tumbled down from\\n above. They faded, were gone.\\nZARWELL found himself\\nstanding on a vast plain. There was\\n no sky above, and no horizon in the\\n distance. He was in a place without\\n space or dimension. There was\\n nothing here except himself—and\\n the gun that he held in his hand.\\n\\n\\n A weapon beautiful in its efficient\\n simplicity.\\n\\n\\n He should know all about the\\n instrument, its purpose and workings,\\n but he could not bring his\\n thoughts into rational focus. His\\n forehead creased with his mental\\n effort.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly the unreality about\\n him shifted perspective. He was\\n approaching—not walking, but\\n merely shortening the space between\\n them—the man who held\\n the gun. The man who was himself.\\n The other “himself” drifted\\n nearer also, as though drawn by a\\n mutual attraction.\\n\\n\\n The man with the gun raised his\\n weapon and pressed the trigger.\\n\\n\\n With the action the perspective\\n shifted again. He was watching the\\n face of the man he shot jerk and\\n twitch, expand and contract. The\\n face was unharmed, yet it was no\\n longer the same. No longer his own\\n features.\\n\\n\\n The stranger face smiled approvingly\\n at him.\\n“O\\n DD,” Bergstrom said.\\nHe brought his hands up and joined\\n the tips of his fingers against his\\n chest. “But it’s another piece in the\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 138\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n jig-saw. In time it will fit into\\n place.” He paused. “It means no\\n more to you than the first, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n “No,” Zarwell answered.\\n\\n\\n He was not a talking man, Bergstrom\\n reflected. It was more than\\n reticence, however. The man had\\n a hard granite core, only partially\\n concealed by his present perplexity.\\n He was a man who could handle\\n himself well in an emergency.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing\\n his strayed thoughts. “I expected\\n as much. A quite normal first phase\\n of treatment.” He straightened a\\n paper on his desk. “I think that will\\n be enough for today. Twice in one\\n sitting is about all we ever try.\\n Otherwise some particular episode\\n might cause undue mental stress,\\n and set up a block.” He glanced\\n down at his appointment pad. “Tomorrow\\n at two, then?”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell grunted acknowledgment\\n and pushed himself to his\\n feet, apparently unaware that his\\n shirt clung damply to his body.\\nTHE sun was still high when\\n Zarwell left the analyst’s office.\\n The white marble of the city’s\\n buildings shimmered in the afternoon\\n heat, squat and austere as\\n giant tree trunks, pock-marked and\\n gray-mottled with windows. Zarwell\\n was careful not to rest his hand\\n on the flesh searing surface of the\\n stone.\\n\\n\\n The evening meal hour was approaching\\n when he reached the\\n Flats, on the way to his apartment.\\n The streets of the old section were\\n near-deserted. The only sounds he\\n heard as he passed were the occasional\\n cry of a baby, chronically\\n uncomfortable in the day’s heat,\\n and the lowing of imported cattle\\n waiting in a nearby shed to be\\n shipped to the country.\\n\\n\\n All St. Martin’s has a distinctive\\n smell, as of an arid dried-out\\n swamp, with a faint taint of fish.\\n But in the Flats the odor changes.\\n Here is the smell of factories, warehouses,\\n and trading marts; the smell\\n of stale cooking drifting from the\\n homes of the laborers and lower\\n class techmen who live there.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell passed a group of\\n smaller children playing a desultory\\n game of lic-lic for pieces of\\n candy and cigarettes. Slowly he\\n climbed the stairs of a stone flat.\\n He prepared a supper for himself\\n and ate it without either enjoyment\\n or distaste. He lay down, fully\\n clothed, on his bed. The visit to the\\n analyst had done nothing to dispel\\n his ennui.\\n\u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 139\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n\\n\\n The next morning when Zarwell\\n awoke he lay for a moment, unmoving.\\n The feeling was there\\n again, like a scene waiting only to\\n be gazed at directly to be perceived.\\n It was as though a great wisdom\\n lay at the edge of understanding.\\n If he rested quietly it would\\n all come to him. Yet always, when\\n his mind lost its sleep-induced\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 140\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n lethargy, the moment of near understanding\\n slipped away.\\n\\n\\n This morning, however, the sense\\n of disorientation did not pass with\\n full wakefulness. He achieved no\\n understanding, but the strangeness\\n did not leave as he sat up.\\n\\n\\n He gazed about him. The room\\n did not seem to be his own. The\\n furnishings, and the clothing he observed\\n in a closet, might have belonged\\n to a stranger.\\n\\n\\n He pulled himself from his blankets,\\n his body moving with mechanical\\n reaction. The slippers into\\n which he put his feet were larger\\n than he had expected them to be.\\n He walked about the small apartment.\\n The place was familiar, but\\n only as it would have been if he\\n had studied it from blueprints, not\\n as though he lived there.\\n\\n\\n The feeling was still with him\\n when he returned to the psychoanalyst.\\nTHE scene this time was more\\n kaleidoscopic, less personal.\\n\\n\\n A village was being ravaged.\\n Men struggled and died in the\\n streets. Zarwell moved among\\n them, seldom taking part in the\\n individual clashes, yet a moving\\n force in the\\n conflict\\n .\\n\\n\\n The background changed. He\\n understood that he was on a different\\n world.\\n\\n\\n Here a city burned. Its resistance\\n was nearing its end. Zarwell was\\n riding a shaggy pony outside a high\\n wall surrounding the stricken metropolis.\\n He moved in and joined a\\n party of short, bearded men, directing\\n them as they battered at the\\n wall with a huge log mounted on a\\n many-wheeled truck.\\n\\n\\n The log broke a breach in the\\n concrete and the besiegers charged\\n through, carrying back the defenders\\n who sought vainly to plug the\\n gap. Soon there would be rioting\\n in the streets again, plundering and\\n killing.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell was not the leader of the\\n invaders, only a lesser figure in the\\n rebellion. But he had played a leading\\n part in the planning of the\\n strategy that led to the city’s fall.\\n The job had been well done.\\n\\n\\n Time passed, without visible\\n break in the panorama. Now Zarwell\\n was fleeing, pursued by the\\n same bearded men who had been\\n his comrades before. Still he moved\\n with the same firm purpose, vigilant,\\n resourceful, and well prepared\\n for the eventuality that had befallen.\\n He made his escape without\\n difficulty.\\n\\n\\n He alighted from a space ship on\\n still another world—another shift\\n in time—and the atmosphere of\\n conflict engulfed him.\\n\\n\\n Weary but resigned he accepted\\n it, and did what he had to do\\xa0…\\nBERGSTROM was regarding\\nhim with speculative scrutiny.\\n “You’ve had quite a past, apparently,”\\n he observed.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 141\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Zarwell smiled with mild embarrassment.\\n “At least in my dreams.”\\n\\n\\n “Dreams?” Bergstrom’s eyes\\n widened in surprise. “Oh, I beg your\\n pardon. I must have forgotten to\\n explain. This work is so routine to\\n me that sometimes I forget it’s all\\n new to a patient. Actually what you\\n experienced under the drug were\\n not dreams. They were recollections\\n of real episodes from your\\n past.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell’s expression became\\n wary. He watched Bergstrom\\n closely. After a minute, however,\\n he seemed satisfied, and he let himself\\n settle back against the cushion\\n of his chair. “I remember nothing\\n of what I saw,” he observed.\\n\\n\\n “That’s why you’re here, you\\n know,” Bergstrom answered. “To\\n help you remember.”\\n\\n\\n “But everything under the drug\\n is so\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n “Haphazard? That’s true. The\\n recall episodes are always purely\\n random, with no chronological sequence.\\n Our problem will be to reassemble\\n them in proper order\\n later. Or some particular scene may\\n trigger a complete memory return.\\n\\n\\n “It is my considered opinion,”\\n Bergstrom went on, “that your lost\\n memory will turn out to be no ordinary\\n amnesia. I believe we will find\\n that your mind has been tampered\\n with.”\\n\\n\\n “Nothing I’ve seen under the\\n drug fits into the past I do remember.”\\n\\n\\n “That’s what makes me so certain,”\\n Bergstrom said confidently.\\n “You don’t remember what we\\n have shown to be true. Conversely\\n then, what you think you remember\\n must be false. It must have been\\n implanted there. But we can go\\n into that later. For today I think\\n we have done enough. This episode\\n was quite prolonged.”\\n\\n\\n “I won’t have any time off again\\n until next week end,” Zarwell reminded\\n him.\\n\\n\\n “That’s right.” Bergstrom\\n thought for a moment. “We\\n shouldn’t let this hang too long.\\n Could you come here after work\\n tomorrow?”\\n\\n\\n “I suppose I could.”\\n\\n\\n “Fine,” Bergstrom said with satisfaction.\\n “I’ll admit I’m considerably\\n more than casually interested\\n in your case by this time.”\\nA WORK truck picked Zarwell\\n up the next morning and he\\n rode with a tech crew to the edge of\\n the reclam area. Beside the belt\\n bringing ocean muck from the converter\\n plant at the seashore his\\n bulldozer was waiting.\\n\\n\\n He took his place behind the\\n drive wheel and began working dirt\\n down between windbreakers anchored\\n in the rock. Along a makeshift\\n road into the badlands trucks\\n brought crushed lime and phosphorus\\n to supplement the ocean\\n sediment. The progress of life from\\n the sea to the land was a mechanical\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 142\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n process of this growing world.\\n\\n\\n Nearly two hundred years ago,\\n when Earth established a colony on\\n St. Martin’s, the land surface of the\\n planet had been barren. Only its\\n seas thrived with animal and vegetable\\n life. The necessary machinery\\n and technicians had been supplied\\n by Earth, and the long struggle began\\n to fit the world for human\\n needs. When Zarwell arrived, six\\n months before, the vitalized area\\n already extended three hundred\\n miles along the coast, and sixty\\n miles inland. And every day the\\n progress continued. A large percentage\\n of the energy and resources\\n of the world were devoted to that\\n essential expansion.\\n\\n\\n The reclam crews filled and\\n sodded the sterile rock, planted\\n binding grasses, grain and trees, and\\n diverted rivers to keep it fertile.\\n When there were no rivers to divert\\n they blasted out springs and lakes\\n in the foothills to make their own.\\n Biologists developed the necessary\\n germ and insect life from what they\\n found in the sea. Where that failed,\\n they imported microorganisms\\n from Earth.\\n\\n\\n Three rubber-tracked crawlers\\n picked their way down from the\\n mountains until they joined the\\n road passing the belt. They were\\n loaded with ore that would be\\n smelted into metal for depleted\\n Earth, or for other colonies short\\n of minerals. It was St. Martin’s only\\n export thus far.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell pulled his sun helmet\\n lower, to better guard his hot, dry\\n features. The wind blew continuously\\n on St. Martin’s, but it furnished\\n small relief from the heat.\\n After its three-thousand-mile journey\\n across scorched sterile rock, it\\n sucked the moisture from a man’s\\n body, bringing a membrane-shrinking\\n dryness to the nostrils as it was\\n breathed in. With it came also the\\n cloying taste of limestone in a\\n worker’s mouth.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell gazed idly about at the\\n other laborers. Fully three-quarters\\n of them were beri-rabza ridden. A\\n cure for the skin fungus had not\\n yet been found; the men’s faces\\n and hands were scabbed and red.\\n The colony had grown to near self-sufficiency,\\n would soon have a moderate\\n prosperity, yet they still\\n lacked adequate medical and research\\n facilities.\\n\\n\\n Not all the world’s citizens were\\n content.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom was waiting in his office\\n when Zarwell arrived that\\n evening.\\nHE was lying motionless on a\\n hard cot, with his eyes closed,\\n yet with his every sense sharply\\n quickened. Tentatively he tightened\\n small muscles in his arms and\\n legs. Across his wrists and thighs\\n he felt straps binding him to the\\n cot.\\n\\n\\n “So that’s our big, bad man,” a\\n coarse voice above him observed\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 143\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n caustically. “He doesn’t look so\\n tough now, does he?”\\n\\n\\n “It might have been better to\\n kill him right away,” a second, less\\n confident voice said. “It’s supposed\\n to be impossible to hold him.”\\n\\n\\n “Don’t be stupid. We just do\\n what we’re told. We’ll hold him.”\\n\\n\\n “What do you think they’ll do\\n with him?”\\n\\n\\n “Execute him, I suppose,” the\\n harsh voice said matter-of-factly.\\n “They’re probably just curious to\\n see what he looks like first. They’ll\\n be disappointed.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to\\n observe his surroundings.\\n\\n\\n It was a mistake. “He’s out of\\n it,” the first speaker said, and Zarwell\\n allowed his eyes to open fully.\\n\\n\\n The voice, he saw, belonged to\\n the big man who had bruised him\\n against the locker at the spaceport.\\n Irrelevantly he wondered how he\\n knew now that it had been a spaceport.\\n\\n\\n His captor’s broad face jeered\\n down at Zarwell. “Have a good\\n sleep?” he asked with mock solicitude.\\n Zarwell did not deign to acknowledge\\n that he heard.\\n\\n\\n The big man turned. “You can\\n tell the Chief he’s awake,” he said.\\n Zarwell followed his gaze to where\\n a younger man, with a blond lock of\\n hair on his forehead, stood behind\\n him. The youth nodded and went\\n out, while the other pulled a chair\\n up to the side of Zarwell’s cot.\\n\\n\\n While their attention was away\\n from him Zarwell had unobtrusively\\n loosened his bonds as much as\\n possible with arm leverage. As the\\n big man drew his chair nearer, he\\n made the hand farthest from him\\n tight and compact and worked it\\n free of the leather loop. He waited.\\n\\n\\n The big man belched. “You’re\\n supposed to be great stuff in a situation\\n like this,” he said, his smoke-tan\\n face splitting in a grin that revealed\\n large square teeth. “How\\n about giving me a sample?”\\n\\n\\n “You’re a yellow-livered bastard,”\\n Zarwell told him.\\n\\n\\n The grin faded from the oily face\\n as the man stood up. He leaned over\\n the cot—and Zarwell’s left hand\\n shot up and locked about his throat,\\n joined almost immediately by the\\n right.\\n\\n\\n The man’s mouth opened and he\\n tried to yell as he threw himself\\n frantically backward. He clawed at\\n the hands about his neck. When\\n that failed to break the grip he suddenly\\n reversed his weight and\\n drove his fist at Zarwell’s head.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell pulled the struggling\\n body down against his chest and\\n held it there until all agitated\\n movement ceased. He sat up then,\\n letting the body slide to the floor.\\n\\n\\n The straps about his thighs came\\n loose with little effort.\\nTHE analyst dabbed at his upper\\n lip with a handkerchief. “The\\n episodes are beginning to tie together,”\\n he said, with an attempt at\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 144\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n nonchalance. “The next couple\\n should do it.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell did not answer. His\\n memory seemed on the point of\\n complete return, and he sat quietly,\\n hopefully. However, nothing more\\n came and he returned his attention\\n to his more immediate problem.\\n\\n\\n Opening a button on his shirt, he\\n pulled back a strip of plastic cloth\\n just below his rib cage and took\\n out a small flat pistol. He held it\\n in the palm of his hand. He knew\\n now why he always carried it.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom had his bad moment.\\n “You’re not going to\\xa0…” he began\\n at the sight of the gun. He tried\\n again. “You must be joking.”\\n\\n\\n “I have very little sense of humor,”\\n Zarwell corrected him.\\n\\n\\n “You’d be foolish!”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom obviously realized\\n how close he was to death. Yet\\n surprisingly, after the first start,\\n he showed little fear. Zarwell had\\n thought the man a bit soft, too\\n adjusted to a life of ease and some\\n prestige to meet danger calmly.\\n Curiosity restrained his trigger finger.\\n\\n\\n “Why would I be foolish?” he\\n asked. “Your Meninger oath of inviolable\\n confidence?”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom shook his head. “I\\n know it’s been broken before. But\\n you need me. You’re not through,\\n you know. If you killed me you’d\\n still have to trust some other\\n analyst.”\\n\\n\\n “Is that the best you can do?”\\n\\n\\n “No.” Bergstrom was angry now.\\n “But use that logical mind you’re\\n supposed to have! Scenes before\\n this have shown what kind of man\\n you are. Just because this last happened\\n here on St. Martin’s makes\\n little difference. If I was going to\\n turn you in to the police, I’d have\\n done it before this.”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell debated with himself the\\n truth of what the other had said.\\n “Why didn’t you turn me in?” he\\n asked.\\n\\n\\n “Because you’re no mad-dog\\n killer!” Now that the crisis seemed\\n to be past, Bergstrom spoke more\\n calmly, even allowed himself to\\n relax. “You’re still pretty much in\\n the fog about yourself. I read more\\n in those comanalyses than you did.\\n I even know who you are!”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell’s eyebrows raised.\\n\\n\\n “Who am I?” he asked, very interested\\n now. Without attention he\\n put his pistol away in a trouser\\n pocket.\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom brushed the question\\n aside with one hand. “Your name\\n makes little difference. You’ve used\\n many. But you are an idealist. Your\\n killings were necessary to bring\\n justice to the places you visited. By\\n now you’re almost a legend among\\n the human worlds. I’d like to talk\\n more with you on that later.”\\n\\n\\n While Zarwell considered, Bergstrom\\n pressed his advantage. “One\\n more scene might do it,” he said.\\n “Should we try again—if you trust\\n me, that is?”\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 145\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n Zarwell made his decision quickly.\\n “Go ahead,” he answered.\\nALL Zarwell’s attention seemed\\n on the cigar he lit as he rode\\n down the escalator, but he surveyed\\n the terminal carefully over the rim\\n of his hand. He spied no suspicious\\n loungers.\\n\\n\\n Behind the escalator he groped\\n along the floor beneath the lockers\\n until he found his key. The briefcase\\n was under his arm a minute\\n later.\\n\\n\\n In the basement lave he put a\\n coin in the pay slot of a private\\n compartment and went in.\\n\\n\\n As he zipped open the briefcase\\n he surveyed his features in the mirror.\\n A small muscle at the corner of\\n one eye twitched spasmodically.\\n One cheek wore a frozen quarter\\n smile. Thirty-six hours under the\\n paralysis was longer than advisable.\\n The muscles should be rested at\\n least every twenty hours.\\n\\n\\n Fortunately his natural features\\n would serve as an adequate disguise\\n now.\\n\\n\\n He adjusted the ring setting on\\n the pistol-shaped instrument that\\n he took from his case, and carefully\\n rayed several small areas of\\n his face, loosening muscles that had\\n been tight too long. He sighed\\n gratefully when he finished, massaging\\n his cheeks and forehead with\\n considerable pleasure. Another\\n glance in the mirror satisfied him\\n with the changes that had been\\n made. He turned to his briefcase\\n again and exchanged the gun for\\n a small syringe, which he pushed\\n into a trouser pocket, and a single-edged\\n razor blade.\\n\\n\\n Removing his fiber-cloth jacket\\n he slashed it into strips with the\\n razor blade and flushed it down the\\n disposal bowl. With the sleeves of\\n his blouse rolled up he had the\\n appearance of a typical workman\\n as he strolled from the compartment.\\n\\n\\n Back at the locker he replaced\\n the briefcase and, with a wad of\\n gum, glued the key to the bottom\\n of the locker frame.\\n\\n\\n One step more. Taking the syringe\\n from his pocket, he plunged\\n the needle into his forearm and\\n tossed the instrument down a\\n waste chute. He took three more\\n steps and paused uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n When he looked about him it\\n was with the expression of a man\\n waking from a vivid dream.\\n“Q\\n UITE ingenious,” Graves\\n murmured admiringly. “You\\n had your mind already preconditioned\\n for the shot. But why would\\n you deliberately give yourself amnesia?”\\n\\n\\n “What better disguise than to\\n believe the part you’re playing?”\\n\\n\\n “A good man must have done\\n that job on your mind,” Bergstrom\\n commented. “I’d have hesitated to\\n try it myself. It must have taken a\\n lot of trust on your part.”\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 146\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n\\n “Trust and money,” Zarwell said\\n drily.\\n\\n\\n “Your memory’s back then?”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell nodded.\\n\\n\\n “I’m glad to hear that,” Bergstrom\\n assured him. “Now that\\n you’re well again I’d like to introduce\\n you to a man named Vernon\\n Johnson. This world\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell stopped him with an upraised\\n hand. “Good God, man, can’t\\n you see the reason for all this? I’m\\n tired. I’m trying to quit.”\\n\\n\\n “Quit?” Bergstrom did not quite\\n follow him.\\n\\n\\n “It started on my home colony,”\\n Zarwell explained listlessly. “A\\n gang of hoods had taken over the\\n government. I helped organize a\\n movement to get them out. There\\n was some bloodshed, but it went\\n quite well. Several months later an\\n unofficial envoy from another\\n world asked several of us to give\\n them a hand on the same kind of\\n job. The political conditions there\\n were rotten. We went with him.\\n Again we were successful. It seems\\n I have a kind of genius for that\\n sort of thing.”\\n\\n\\n He stretched out his legs and regarded\\n them thoughtfully. “I\\n learned then the truth of Russell’s\\n saying: ‘When the oppressed win\\n their freedom they are as oppressive\\n as their former masters.’ When\\n they went bad, I opposed them.\\n This time I failed. But I escaped\\n again. I have quite a talent for that\\n also.\\n\\n\\n “I’m not a professional do-gooder.”\\n Zarwell’s tone appealed\\n to Bergstrom for understanding. “I\\n have only a normal man’s indignation\\n at injustice. And now I’ve done\\n my share. Yet, wherever I go, the\\n word eventually gets out, and I’m\\n right back in a fight again. It’s like\\n the proverbial monkey on my back.\\n I can’t get rid of it.”\\n\\n\\n He rose. “That disguise and\\n memory planting were supposed to\\n get me out of it. I should have\\n known it wouldn’t work. But this\\n time I’m not going to be drawn\\n back in! You and your Vernon\\n Johnson can do your own revolting.\\n I’m through!”\\n\\n\\n Bergstrom did not argue as he\\n left.\\nRESTLESSNESS drove Zarwell\\n from his flat the next day—a\\n legal holiday on St. Martin’s. At\\n a railed-off lot he stopped and loitered\\n in the shadow of an adjacent\\n building watching workmen drilling\\n an excavation for a new structure.\\n\\n\\n When a man strolled to his side\\n and stood watching the workmen,\\n he was not surprised. He waited for\\n the other to speak.\\n\\n\\n “I’d like to talk to you, if you\\n can spare a few minutes,” the\\n stranger said.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell turned and studied the\\n man without answering. He was\\n medium tall, with the body of an\\n athlete, though perhaps ten years\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mp\\n 147\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\n beyond the age of sports. He had\\n a manner of contained energy.\\n “You’re Johnson?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n The man nodded.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell tried to feel the anger he\\n wanted to feel, but somehow it\\n would not come. “We have nothing\\n to talk about,” was the best he\\n could manage.\\n\\n\\n “Then will you just listen? After,\\n I’ll leave—if you tell me to.”\\n\\n\\n Against his will he found himself\\n liking the man, and wanting at least\\n to be courteous. He inclined his\\n head toward a curb wastebox with\\n a flat top. “Should we sit?”\\n\\n\\n Johnson smiled agreeably and\\n they walked over to the box and\\n sat down.\\n\\n\\n “When this colony was first\\n founded,” Johnson began without\\n preamble, “the administrative body\\n was a governor, and a council of\\n twelve. Their successors were to\\n be elected biennially. At first they\\n were. Then things changed. We\\n haven’t had an election now in the\\n last twenty-three years. St. Martin’s\\n is beginning to prosper. Yet\\n the only ones receiving the benefits\\n are the rulers. The citizens work\\n twelve hours a day. They are poorly\\n housed\\n , poorly fed, poorly clothed.\\n They\\xa0…”\\n\\n\\n Zarwell found himself not listening\\n as Johnson’s voice went on. The\\n story was always the same. But why\\n did they always try to drag him into\\n their troubles?\\n\\n\\n Why hadn’t he chosen some\\n other world on which to hide?\\n\\n\\n The last question prompted a\\n new thought. Just why had he\\n chosen St. Martin’s? Was it only a\\n coincidence? Or had he,\\n subconsciously\\n at least, picked this particular\\n world? He had always\\n considered himself the unwilling\\n subject of glib persuaders … but\\n mightn’t some inner compulsion of\\n his own have put the monkey on his\\n back?\\n\\n\\n “…\\xa0and we need your help.”\\n Johnson had finished his speech.\\n\\n\\n Zarwell gazed up at the bright\\n sky. He pulled in a long breath,\\n and let it out in a sigh.\\n\\n\\n “What are your plans so far?”\\n he asked wearily.\\n—\\nCHARLES V. DE VET\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

This system is designed to provide a fair distribution of work opportunities while accommodating the realities of automation, which has rendered many jobs obsolete. Upon being drafted, workers like Seymour Pond receive specialized training for their designated roles, such as space piloting, which requires significant investment in their skills and capabilities.

This accumulation of shares serves as a form of financial security, allowing retirees to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without the necessity of further labor.
