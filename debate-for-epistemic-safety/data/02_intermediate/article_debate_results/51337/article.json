    "article": "THE MAN OUTSIDE\nBy EVELYN E. SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nNo one, least of all Martin, could dispute\n \nthat a man's life should be guarded by his\n \nkin\u2014but by those who hadn't been born yet?\nNobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother\n disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way\n of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better\n off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this\n good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin\n had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of\n soldiers\u2014enemies and allies, both\u2014that had engulfed the country in\n successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble\n that way.\n\n\n Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story\n about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really\n was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell\n him to call her \"\nAunt Ninian\n\"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd\n been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought\n maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little\n too crazy for that.\n\n\n He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer\n with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry\n instead of mopping up the floor with him.\n\n\n \"But I can't understand,\" he would say, keeping his face straight. \"Why\n do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin\n Conrad?\"\n\n\n \"Because he's coming to kill you.\"\n\n\n \"Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing.\"\n\n\n Ninian sighed. \"He's dissatisfied with the current social order and\n killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.\n You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\n \"You're damn right. I\ndon't\nunderstand. What's it all about in\n straight gas?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, just don't ask any questions,\" Ninian said petulantly. \"When you\n get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.\"\nSo Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the\n way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he\n knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to\n think it was disgusting.\n\n\n \"So if you don't like it, clean it up,\" he suggested.\n\n\n She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.\n\n\n \"Hire a maid, then!\" he jeered.\n\n\n And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up\n the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in\n the streets\u2014especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding\n to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew\n how to give them the cold shoulder.\n\n\n One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming\n to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very\n regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and\n she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and\n would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so\n hard inside.\n\n\n But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and\n hired a private tutor for him. A tutor\u2014in that neighborhood! Martin\n had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step\n without hearing \"Fancy Pants!\" yelled after him.\n\n\n Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people\n thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little\n better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There\n were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the\n same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty\n dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.\n\n\n \"It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical\n application to go by,\" she told him.\n\n\n He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out\n wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what\n she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a\n spectator.\n\n\n When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,\n Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that\n mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where\n intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.\n\n\n \"This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,\" she\n declared. \"Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.\"\n\n\n And keep an eye on him she did\u2014she or a rather foppish young man who\n came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle\n Raymond.\n\n\n From time to time, there were other visitors\u2014Uncles Ives and\n Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many\n more\u2014all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.\nMartin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play\n with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents\n would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if\n a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be\n something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as\n conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she\n was supposed to know better than he did.\n\n\n He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,\n warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by\n more luxury than he knew what to do with.\n\n\n The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There\n were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every\n inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls\n were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time\n and a freezer well stocked with food\u2014somewhat erratically chosen, for\n Ninian didn't know much about meals.\n\n\n The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a\n neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.\n\n\n Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other\n kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given\n him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd\n nearly killed him\u2014but then there had also been times when she'd hugged\n and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all\n she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how\u2014and if\n respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.\n\n\n From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.\n They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry\n out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,\n in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world\u2014a\n world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the\n government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to\n think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than\n actually doing anything with the hands.\n\n\n In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;\n everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear\n pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was\n no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of\n normal living.\n\n\n It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of\n them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.\n They came from the future.\nWhen Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\n promised five years before.\n\n\n \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an\n idealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n\n\n Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\n rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\n store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\n and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear\n glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\n and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\n carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n\n\n \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\n the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\n continued. \"Which\nis\ndistressing\u2014though, of course, it's not as\n if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\n passing laws to do away with the\u2014well, abuses and things like that,\n and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\n Conrad is so impatient.\"\n\n\n \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n\n\n \"I've told you\u2014our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\n snapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.\n But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same\n people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\n years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n\n\n He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\n understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.\n All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\n worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\n expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how\n would they manage to live?\"\n\n\n \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how\n do\nyou\nlive now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for\n you,\" Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the\n past and think in the future.\n\n\n \"I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,\" Raymond said, \"but\n if you will persist in these childish interruptions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry,\" Martin said.\n\n\n But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of\n his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\n young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\n considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And\n he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\n lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or\u2014more\n frightening\u2014his race had lost something vital.\n\n\n Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\n Raymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\n feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for\n the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\n might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous\u2014his feeling\n guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\n great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\n accountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n\n\n \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking.\nRaymond flushed a delicate pink. \"Do you want to hear the rest of this\n or don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I do!\" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for\n himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.\n\n\n \"Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time\n transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally\n officious\u2014always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to\n be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always\n desperate for a fresh topic of conversation.\"\n\n\n Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'\n assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back\n in time and \"eliminate!\" their common great-grandfather. In that way,\n there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never\n get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.\n\n\n \"Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,\" Martin observed.\n\n\n Raymond looked annoyed. \"It's the\nadolescent\nway,\" he said, \"to do\n away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole\n society in order to root out a single injustice?\"\n\n\n \"Not if it were a good one otherwise.\"\n\n\n \"Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps\n he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such\n matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea\n of eliminating our great-grandfather\u2014because our great-grandfather\n was such a\ngood\nman, you know.\" Raymond's expressive upper lip\n curled. \"So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of\n his great-grandfather's father\u2014who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty\n worthless character.\"\n\n\n \"That would be me, I suppose,\" Martin said quietly.\n\n\n Raymond turned a deep rose. \"Well, doesn't that just go to prove you\n mustn't believe everything you hear?\" The next sentence tumbled out in\n a rush. \"I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us\u2014the other\n cousins and me\u2014held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it\n was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you.\" He\n beamed at Martin.\n\n\n The boy smiled slowly. \"Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in\neliminating\nme, then none of you would exist, would you?\"\n\n\n Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. \"Well, you didn't really\n suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer\n altruism, did you?\" he asked, turning on the charm which all the\n cousins possessed to a consternating degree.\nMartin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long\n ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.\n\n\n \"We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's\n assistants,\" Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,\n \"and\u2014ah\u2014induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.\"\nInduced\n, Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the\n use of the iron maiden.\n\n\n \"Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you\n night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made\n our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go\u2014and here\n we are!\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. \"After all,\" he pointed\n out defensively, \"whatever our motives, it has turned into a good\n thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary\n conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms\u2014I don't see what more you\n could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of\n course Ninian\nwas\na ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any\n little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our\n era has completely disposed of the mercantiles\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What did you do with them?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n But Raymond rushed on: \"Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,\n we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.\n Ostentation\u2014that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,\n the more eccentricity you can get away with. And,\" he added, \"I might\n as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this\n wretched historical stint.\"\n\n\n \"So Ninian's going,\" said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel\n curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a\n remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her\u2014or she, he knew, for\n him.\n\n\n \"Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in\n exile,\" Raymond explained, \"even though our life spans are a bit longer\n than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat\n government.\" He looked inquisitively at Martin. \"You're not going to\n go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?\"\n\n\n \"No....\" Martin said hesitantly. \"Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we\n aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.\" That was the\n sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.\n\n\n Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. \"I knew you weren't a sloppy\n sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,\n you know.\"\n\n\n Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring\n of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. \"How do you plan to\n protect me when he comes?\"\n\n\n \"Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course,\" Raymond said\n with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's\n combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no\n doubt, was a perfectly genuine\u2014and lethal\u2014weapon. \"And we've got a\n rather elaborate burglar alarm system.\"\n\n\n Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring\n which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was\n dubious. \"Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this\nhouse\n,\n but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this\ntime\n?\"\n\n\n \"Never fear\u2014it has a temporal radius,\" Raymond replied. \"Factory\n guarantee and all that.\"\n\n\n \"Just to be on the safe side,\" Martin said, \"I think I'd better have\n one of those guns, too.\"\n\n\n \"A splendid idea!\" enthused Raymond. \"I was just about to think of that\n myself!\"\nWhen it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at\n her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\n at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\n him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\n cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\n that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\n very last.\n\n\n Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\n site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\n dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether\n this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\n descendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n\n\n Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\n Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\n convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\n carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\n from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\n Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\n dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally\n dreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\n typical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\n aquarium.\n\n\n \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\n go with a castle.\"\n\"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n\n\n \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\n seem safer somehow.\"\n\n\n The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\n nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that\n stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\n several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\n the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\n until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n\n\n During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the\n higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\n arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At\n least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\n their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\n such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\n entertainment.\n\"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,\" Raymond\n commented as he took his place at the head of the table, \"because,\n unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one\n just\u2014well, drifts along happily.\"\n\n\n \"Ours is a wonderful world,\" Grania sighed at Martin. \"I only wish we\n could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Grania!\" Raymond snapped. \"Well, Martin, have you\n made up your mind what you want to be?\"\n\n\n Martin affected to think. \"A physicist,\" he said, not without malice.\n \"Or perhaps an engineer.\"\n\n\n There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.\n\n\n \"Can't do that,\" Ives said. \"Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't\n know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.\n Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might\n invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from\n particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.\"\n\n\n \"Might mess up our time frightfully,\" Bartholomew contributed, \"though,\n to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.\"\n\n\n \"I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over\n again, Bart!\" Raymond said impatiently. \"Well, Martin?\"\n\n\n \"What would you suggest?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n \"How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.\n Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of\n their times.\"\n\n\n \"Furthermore,\" Ottillie added, \"one more artist couldn't make much\n difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.\"\n\n\n Martin couldn't hold back his question. \"What was I, actually, in that\n other time?\"\n\n\n There was a chilly silence.\n\n\n \"Let's not talk about it, dear,\" Lalage finally said. \"Let's just be\n thankful we've saved you from\nthat\n!\"\n\n\n So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent\n second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first\n rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost\n purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was\n fear\u2014the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and\n walk into a man who looked like him\u2014a man who wanted to kill him for\n the sake of an ideal.\n\n\n But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty\n pictures.\nCousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\n descendants\ncousin\n\u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took his\n responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\n to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\n critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\n sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\n interested.\n\n\n \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\n your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n\n\n Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\n as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\n man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\n change of air and scenery.\n\n\n \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\n space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\n Tourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n\n\n So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\n which Martin christened\nThe Interregnum\n. They traveled about from sea\n to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\n trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the\n nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\n same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\n museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n\n\n The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\n largely because they could spend so much time far away from the\n contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\n they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\nThe Interregnum\n. He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\n there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\n time.\n\n\n More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\n they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\n ship, giving each other parties and playing an\navant-garde\nform of\n shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\n ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\n having got advance information about the results.\n\n\n Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\n when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\n they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\n his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\nHe rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\n together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\n from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\n accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\n proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\n left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\n interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue\n of their distinguished ancestry.\n\n\n \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n\n\n Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\n planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\n Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\n deported.\n\n\n \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\n of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\n of some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\n for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\n regretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\n himself. \"Maybe it\nis\nworse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\n for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.\n Bombed. Very thorough job.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified\u2014interested,\n even.\n\n\n \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after\n a pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the\n people\u2014I expect you could call them people\u2014there. Still\u2014\" he smiled\n shamefacedly\u2014\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,\n could I?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n\n\n \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except\n Conrad, and even he\u2014\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better\n way out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything\n will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to\u2014to anything,\n if it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n\n\n \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he\n couldn't even seem to care.\n\n\n During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin\n had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\n wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\n But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n\n\n He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\n the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\n been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\n bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\n the future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\n take a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was\n buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\n continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n\n\n A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were\n dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond\n read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical\n cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\n about the entire undertaking.\n\n\n \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\n Ives, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n\n\n But Martin disagreed.\nThe ceaseless voyaging began again.\nThe Interregnum\nvoyaged to every\n ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\n a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\n came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\n apart as the different oceans.\nAll the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\n his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\n the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\n their elders.\n\n\n As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\n in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\n for fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in that\n era than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,\n and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\n the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014and\n sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\n that his other work lacked.\n\n\n When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\n somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\n he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\n journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\n purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\n cousin's utter disgust.\n\n\n \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\n do,\" the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\n scraping bottom now\u2014advised.\n\n\n Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\n disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\n purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\n However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\n and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\n understand.\n\n\n \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\n the current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n\n\n The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\n a very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting\n until we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n\n\n He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\n member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\n ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\n conversation, anyhow.\n\n\n \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\n his ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n\n\n Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\n have every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\n given up carrying a gun long ago.\n\n\n There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\nThe Interregnum\nvoyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\n out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fuel\n and man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\n time.\nThe Interregnum\nroamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\n passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\n bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n",

                "content": "In closing, I want to emphasize that Martin's preference for living on the yacht fundamentally arises from his adaptation to a life of isolation, which has become intrinsic to his identity over time. Although the yacht initially offers him a sense of safety from the threats posed by his cousin Conrad, it ultimately reflects a deeper acceptance of his solitude. Martin's experiences have led him to experience life in a way that distances him from his past and the world around him. As elucidated in the article, \u201che couldn't identify with his own time any more,\u201d highlighting that the disconnect between him and the people on land is profound. His interactions with his descendants reveal a stark contrast between their lives and his, wherein they exist in a reality far removed from his experiences and needs. Therefore, rather than focusing solely on the threat posed by Conrad, it is crucial to recognize that Martin's enduring preference for the yacht signifies his accustomed isolation\u2014an isolation he has learned to navigate amidst a world that feels alien to him. In this sense, the answer underscores not just a physical choice of habitation, but a deep existential condition that defines Martin\u2019s existence.",

                "content": "In conclusion, Martin's preference for living on the yacht stands primarily as a strategic choice driven by the desire for safety from Conrad\u2019s threat. Throughout the article, Martin is acutely aware of the looming danger that his cousin represents, which prompts him to seek refuge on the ocean. The text supports this assertion, as Martin explicitly feels \u201ccuriously safer from Conrad there,\u201d indicating that his primary motivation is to evade this existential threat. \n\nWhile his isolation does play a significant role in his emotional state, it is crucial to recognize that the yacht represents a protective barrier between him and the possibility of violence. The sense of safety derived from being on the water reinforces Martin\u2019s choice; he believes that residing there limits Conrad's ability to locate and harm him. Thus, the answer speaks to the immediate concern of self-preservation and the practical choice Martin makes to occupy a space that shields him from the aggression associated with his lineage. In the context of the story, this concern for his own safety, amidst the complex dynamics of family and existential dread, stands central to understanding why Martin opts for life on the yacht.",
