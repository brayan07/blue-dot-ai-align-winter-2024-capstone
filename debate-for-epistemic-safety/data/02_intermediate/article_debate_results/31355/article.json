That's straight ahead to the sun with\n the red rim around it.\"\nBut Dunbar's eyes were old and uncertain. How could they\n believe in his choice when every star in this forsaken\n section of space was surrounded by a beckoning red rim?\nThere was just blackness, frosty glimmering terrible blackness, going\n out and out forever in all directions. Russell didn't think they could\n remain sane in all this blackness much longer. Bitterly he thought of\n how they would die\u2014not knowing within maybe thousands of light years\n where they were, or where they were going.\n\n\n After the wreck, the four of them had floated a while, floated and\n drifted together, four men in bulbous pressure suits like small\n individual rockets, held together by an awful pressing need for each\n other and by the \"gravity-rope\" beam.\n\n\n Dunbar, the oldest of the four, an old space-buster with a face\n wrinkled like a dried prune, burned by cosmic rays and the suns of\n worlds so far away they were scarcely credible, had taken command.\n Suddenly, Old Dunbar had known where they were. Suddenly, Dunbar knew\n where they were going.\n\n\n They could talk to one another through the etheric transmitters inside\n their helmets. They could live ... if this was living ... a long time,\n if only a man's brain would hold up, Russell thought. The suits were\n complete units. 700 pounds each, all enclosing shelters, with\n atmosphere pressure, temperature control, mobility in space, and\n electric power. Each suit had its own power-plant, reprocessing\n continuously the precious air breathed by the occupants, putting it\n back into circulation again after enriching it. Packed with food\n concentrates. Each suit a rocket, each human being part of a rocket,\n and the special \"life-gun\" that went with each suit each blast of\n which sent a man a few hundred thousand miles further on toward\n wherever he was going.\n\n\n Four men, thought Russell, held together by an invisible string of\n gravity, plunging through a lost pocket of hell's dark where there had\n never been any sound or life, with old Dunbar the first in line,\n taking the lead because he was older and knew where he was and where\n he was going. Maybe Johnson, second in line, and Alvar who was third,\n knew too, but were afraid to admit it.\n\n\n But Russell knew it and he'd admitted it from the first\u2014that old\n Dunbar was as crazy as a Jovian juke-bird.\n\n\n A lot of time had rushed past into darkness. Russell had no idea now\n how long the four of them had been plunging toward the red-rimmed sun\n that never seemed to get any nearer. When the ultra-drive had gone\n crazy the four of them had blanked out and nobody could say now how\n long an interim that had been. Nobody knew what happened to a man who\n suffered a space-time warping like that. When they had regained\n consciousness, the ship was pretty banged up, and the meteor-repeller\n shields cracked. A meteor ripped the ship down the center like an old\n breakfast cannister.\n\n\n How long ago that had been, Russell didn't know. All Russell knew was\n that they were millions of light years from any place he had ever\n heard about, where the galactic space lanterns had absolutely no\n recognizable pattern. But Dunbar knew. And Russell was looking at\n Dunbar's suit up ahead, watching it more and more intently, thinking\n about how Dunbar looked inside that suit\u2014and hating Dunbar more and\n more for claiming he knew when he didn't, for his drooling\n optimism\u2014because he was taking them on into deeper darkness and\n calling their destination Paradise.\n\n\n Russell wanted to laugh, but the last time he'd given way to this\n impulse, the results inside his helmet had been too unpleasant to\n repeat.\n\n\n Sometimes Russell thought of other things besides his growing hatred\n of the old man. Sometimes he thought about the ship, lost back there\n in the void, and he wondered if wrecked space ships were ever found.\n Compared with the universe in which one of them drifted, a wrecked\n ship was a lot smaller than a grain of sand on a nice warm beach back\n on Earth, or one of those specks of silver dust that floated like\n strange seeds down the night winds of Venus.\n\n\n And a human was smaller still, thought Russell when he was not hating\n Dunbar. Out here, a human being is the smallest thing of all. He\n thought then of what Dunbar would say to such a thought, how Dunbar\n would laugh that high piping squawking laugh of his and say that the\n human being was bigger than the Universe itself.\n\n\n Dunbar had a big answer for every little thing.\n\n\n When the four of them had escaped from that prison colony on a\n sizzling hot asteroid rock in the Ronlwhyn system, that wasn't enough\n for Dunbar. Hell no\u2014Dunbar had to start talking about a place they\n could go where they'd never be apprehended, in a system no one else\n had ever heard of, where they could live like gods on a green soft\n world like the Earth had been a long time back.\n\n\n And Dunbar had spouted endlessly about a world of treasure they would\n find, if they would just follow old Dunbar. That's what all four of\n them had been trying to find all their lives in the big cold grabbag\n of eternity\u2014a rich star, a rich far fertile star where no one else\n had ever been, loaded with treasure that had no name, that no one had\n ever heard of before. And was, because of that, the richest treasure\n of all.\n\n\n We all look alike out here in these big rocket pressure suits, Russell\n thought. No one for God only knew how many of millions of light years\n away could see or care. Still\u2014we might have a chance to live, even\n now, Russell thought\u2014if it weren't for old crazy Dunbar.\n\n\n They might have a chance if Alvar and Johnson weren't so damn lacking\n in self-confidence as to put all their trust in that crazed old\n rum-dum. Russell had known now for some time that they were going in\n the wrong direction. No reason for knowing. Just a hunch. And Russell\n was sure his hunch was right.\nRussell said. \"Look\u2014look to your left and to your right and behind\n us. Four suns. You guys see those other three suns all around you,\n don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" someone said.\n\n\n \"Well, if you'll notice,\" Russell said, \"the one on the left also now\n has a red rim around it. Can't you guys see that?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, I see it,\" Alvar said.\n\n\n \"So now,\" Johnson said, \"there's two suns with red rims around them.\"\n\n\n \"We're about in the middle of those four suns aren't we, Dunbar?\"\n Russell said.\n\n\n \"That's right, boys!\" yelled old Dunbar in that sickeningly optimistic\n voice. Like a hysterical old woman's. \"Just about in the sweet dark\n old middle.\"\n\n\n \"You're still sure it's the sun up ahead ... that's the only one with\n life on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?\" Russell asked.\n\n\n \"That's right! That's right,\" Dunbar yelled. \"That's the only one\u2014and\n it's a paradise. Not just a place to live, boys\u2014but a place you'll\n have trouble believing in because it's like a dream!\"\n\n\n \"And none of these other three suns have worlds we could live on,\n Dunbar?\" Russell asked. Keep the old duck talking like this and maybe\n Alvar and Johnson would see that he was cracked.\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"You still say that, Dunbar?\"\n\n\n \"No life, boys, nothing,\" Dunbar laughed. \"Nothing on these other\n worlds but ashes ... just ashes and iron and dried blood, dried a\n million years or more.\"\n\n\n \"When in hell were you ever here?\" Johnson said. \"You say you were\n here before. You never said when, or why or anything!\"\n\n\n \"It was a long time back boys. Don't remember too well, but it was\n when we had an old ship called the DOG STAR that I was here. A pirate\n ship and I was second in command, and we came through this sector.\n That was\u2014hell, it musta' been fifty years ago. I been too many places\n nobody's ever bothered to name or chart, to remember where it is, but\n I been here. I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect\n circle from this point, with us squarely in the middle. We explored\n all these suns and the worlds that go round 'em. Trust me, boys, and\n we'll reach the right one. And that one's just like Paradise.\"\n\n\n \"Paradise is it,\" Russell whispered hoarsely.\n\n\n \"Paradise and there we'll be like gods, like Mercuries with wings\n flying on nights of sweet song. These other suns, don't let them\n bother you. They're Jezebels of stars. All painted up in the darkness\n and pretty and waiting and calling and lying! They make you think of\n nice green worlds all running waters and dews and forests thick as\n fleas on a wet dog. But it ain't there, boys. I know this place. I\n been here, long time back.\"\n\n\n Russell said tightly. \"It'll take us a long time won't it? If it's got\n air we can breath, and water we can drink and shade we can rest\n in\u2014that'll be paradise enough for us. But it'll take a long time\n won't it? And what if it isn't there\u2014what if after all the time we\n spend hoping and getting there\u2014there won't be nothing but ashes and\n cracked clay?\"\n\n\n \"I know we're going right,\" Dunbar said cheerfully. \"I can tell. Like\n I said\u2014you can tell it because of the red rim around it.\"\n\n\n \"But the sun on our left, you can see\u2014it's got a red rim too now,\"\n Russell said.\n\n\n \"Yeah, that's right,\" said Alvar. \"Sometimes I see a red rim around\n the one we're going for, sometimes a red rim around that one on the\n left. Now, sometimes I'm not sure either of them's got a red rim. You\n said that one had a red rim, Dunbar, and I wanted to believe it. So\n now maybe we're all seeing a red rim that was never there.\"\n\n\n Old Dunbar laughed. The sound brought blood hotly to Russell's face.\n \"We're heading to the right one, boys. Don't doubt me ... I been here.\n We explored all these sun systems. And I remember it all. The second\n planet from that red-rimmed sun. You come down through a soft\n atmosphere, floating like in a dream. You see the green lakes coming\n up through the clouds and the women dancing and the music playing. I\n remember seeing a ship there that brought those women there, a long\n long time before ever I got there. A land like heaven and women like\n angels singing and dancing and laughing with red lips and arms white\n as milk, and soft silky hair floating in the winds.\"\n\n\n Russell was very sick of the old man's voice. He was at least glad he\n didn't have to look at the old man now. His bald head, his skinny\n bobbing neck, his simpering watery blue eyes. But he still had to\n suffer that immutable babbling, that idiotic cheerfulness ... and\n knowing all the time the old man was crazy, that he was leading them\n wrong.\n\n\n I'd break away, go it alone to the right sun, Russell thought\u2014but I'd\n never make it alone. A little while out here alone and I'd be nuttier\n than old Dunbar will ever be, even if he keeps on getting nuttier all\n the time.\n\n\n Somewhere, sometime then ... Russell got the idea that the only way\n was to get rid of Dunbar.\nYou mean to tell us there are people living by that red-rimmed sun,\"\n Russell said.\n\n\n \"Lost people ... lost ... who knows how long,\" Dunbar said, as the\n four of them hurtled along. \"You never know where you'll find people\n on a world somewhere nobody's ever named or knows about. Places where\n a lost ship's landed and never got up again, or wrecked itself so far\n off the lanes they'll never be found except by accident for millions\n of years. That's what this world is, boys. Must have been a ship load\n of beautiful people, maybe actresses and people like that being hauled\n to some outpost to entertain. They're like angels now, living in a\n land all free from care. Every place you see green forests and fields\n and blue lakes, and at nights there's three moons that come around the\n sky in a thousand different colors. And it never gets cold ... it's\n always spring, always spring, boys, and the music plays all night,\n every night of a long long year....\"\n\n\n Russell suddenly shouted. \"Keep quiet, Dunbar. Shut up will you?\"\n\n\n Johnson said. \"Dunbar\u2014how long'll it take us?\"\n\n\n \"Six months to a year, I'd say,\" Dunbar yelled happily. \"That is\u2014of\n our hereditary time.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" croaked Alvar.\n\n\n Johnson didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n Russell screamed at Dunbar, then quieted down. He whispered. \"Six\n months to a year\u2014out here\u2014cooped up in these damn suits. You're\n crazy as hell, Dunbar. Crazy ... crazy! Nobody could stand it. We'll\n all be crazier than you are\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll make it, boys. Trust ole' Dunbar. What's a year when we know\n we're getting to Paradise at the end of it? What's a year out here ...\n it's paradise ain't it, compared with that prison hole we were rotting\n in? We can make it. We have the food concentrates, and all the rest.\n All we need's the will, boys, and we got that. The whole damn Universe\n isn't big enough to kill the will of a human being, boys. I been over\n a whole lot of it, and I know. In the old days\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The hell with the old days,\" screamed Russell.\n\n\n \"Now quiet down, Russ,\" Dunbar said in a kind of dreadful crooning\n whisper. \"You calm down now. You younger fellows\u2014you don't look at\n things the way we used to. Thing is, we got to go straight. People\n trapped like this liable to start meandering. Liable to start losing\n the old will-power.\"\n\n\n He chuckled.\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" said Alvar. \"Someone says maybe we ought to go left, and\n someone says to go right, and someone else says to go in another\n direction. And then someone says maybe they'd better go back the old\n way. An' pretty soon something breaks, or the food runs out, and\n you're a million million miles from someplace you don't care about any\n more because you're dead. All frozen up in space ... preserved like a\n piece of meat in a cold storage locker. And then maybe in a million\n years or so some lousy insect man from Jupiter comes along and finds\n you and takes you away to a museum....\"\n\n\n \"Shut up!\" Johnson yelled.\n\n\n Dunbar laughed. \"Boys, boys, don't get panicky. Keep your heads. Just\n stick to old Dunbar and he'll see you through. I'm always lucky. Only\n one way to go ... an' that's straight ahead to the sun with the\n red-rim around it ... and then we tune in the gravity repellers, and\n coast down, floating and singing down through the clouds to\n paradise.\"\n\n\n After that they traveled on for what seemed months to Russell, but it\n couldn't have been over a day or two of the kind of time-sense he had\n inherited from Earth.\n\n\n Then he saw how the other two stars also were beginning to develop red\n rims. He yelled this fact out to the others. And Alvar said. \"Russ's\n right. That sun to the right, and the one behind us ... now they ALL\n have red rims around them. Dunbar\u2014\" A pause and no awareness of\n motion.\n\n\n Dunbar laughed. \"Sure, they all maybe have a touch of red, but it\n isn't the same, boys. I can tell the difference. Trust me\u2014\"\n\n\n Russell half choked on his words. \"You old goat! With those old eyes\n of yours, you couldn't see your way into a fire!\"\n\n\n \"Don't get panicky now. Keep your heads. In another year, we'll be\n there\u2014\"\n\n\n \"God, you gotta' be sure,\" Alvar said. \"I don't mind dyin' out here.\n But after a year of this, and then to get to a world that was only\n ashes, and not able to go any further\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I always come through, boys. I'm lucky. Angel women will take us to\n their houses on the edges of cool lakes, little houses that sit there\n in the sun like fancy jewels. And we'll walk under colored fountains,\n pretty colored fountains just splashing and splashing like pretty rain\n on our hungry hides. That's worth waiting for.\"\n\n\n Russell did it before he hardly realized he was killing the old man.\n It was something he had had to do for a long time and that made it\n easy. There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of\n Dunbar. If he'd aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have\n pierced Dunbar's back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished\n automatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated,\n self-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them\n hurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front\n of the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead.\n\n\n He was dead and his mouth was shut for good.\n\n\n Dunbar's last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell's\n ears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and\n Johnson both called Dunbar's name a few times. There was no answer.\n\n\n \"Russ\u2014you shouldn't have done that,\" Johnson whispered. \"You\n shouldn't have done that to the old man!\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Alvar said, so low he could barely be heard. \"You shouldn't have\n done it.\"\n\n\n \"I did it for the three of us,\" Russell said. \"It was either him or us.\n Lies ... lies that was all he had left in his crazy head. Paradise ...\n don't tell me you guys don't see the red rims around all four suns, all\n four suns all around us. Don't tell me you guys didn't know he was batty,\n that you really believed all that stuff he was spouting all the time!\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he was lying, maybe not,\" Johnson said. \"Now he's dead anyway.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he was wrong, crazy, full of lies,\" Alvar said. \"But now he's\n dead.\"\n\n\n \"How could he see any difference in those four stars?\" Russell said,\n louder.\n\n\n \"He thought he was right,\" Alvar said. \"He wanted to take us to\n paradise. He was happy, nothing could stop the old man\u2014but he's dead\n now.\"\n\n\n He sighed.\n\n\n \"He was taking us wrong ... wrong!\" Russell screamed. \"Angels\u2014music\n all night\u2014houses like jewels\u2014and women like angels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"\nShhhh\n,\" said Alvar. It was quiet. How could it be so quiet, Russell\n thought? And up ahead the old man's pressure suit with a corpse inside\n went on ahead, leading the other three at the front of the\n gravity-rope.\n\n\n \"Maybe he was wrong,\" Alvar said. \"But now do we know which way is\n right?\"\nSometime later, Johnson said, \"We got to decide now. Let's forget the\n old man. Let's forget him and all that's gone and let's start now and\n decide what to do.\"\n\n\n And Alvar said, \"Guess he was crazy all right, and I guess we trusted\n him because we didn't have the strength to make up our own minds. Why\n does a crazy man's laugh sound so good when you're desperate and don't\n know what to do?\"\n\n\n \"I always had a feeling we were going wrong,\" Johnson said. \"Anyway,\n it's forgotten, Russ. It's swallowed up in the darkness all around.\n It's never been.\"\n\n\n Russell said, \"I've had a hunch all along that maybe the old man was\n here before, and that he was right about there being a star here with\n a world we can live on. But I've known we was heading wrong. I've had\n a hunch all along that the right star was the one to the left.\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Johnson sighed. \"I been feeling partial toward that\n one on the right. What about you, Alvar?\"\n\n\n \"I always thought we were going straight in the opposite direction\n from what we should, I guess. I always wanted to turn around and go\n back. It won't make over maybe a month's difference. And what does a\n month matter anyway out here\u2014hell there never was any time out here\n until we came along. We make our own time here, and a month don't\n matter to me.\"\n\n\n Sweat ran down Russell's face. His voice trembled. \"No\u2014that's wrong.\n You're both wrong.\" He could see himself going it alone. Going crazy\n because he was alone. He'd have broken away, gone his own direction,\n long ago but for that fear.\n\n\n \"How can we tell which of us is right?\" Alvar said. \"It's like\n everything was changing all the time out here. Sometimes I'd swear\n none of those suns had red rims, and at other times\u2014like the old man\n said, they're all pretty and lying and saying nothing, just changing\n all the time. Jezebel stars, the old man said.\"\n\n\n \"I know I'm right,\" Russell pleaded. \"My hunches always been right.\n My hunch got us out of that prison didn't it? Listen\u2014I tell you it's\n that star to the left\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The one to the right,\" said Johnson.\n\n\n \"We been going away from the right one all the time,\" said Alvar.\n\n\n \"We got to stay together,\" said Russell. \"Nobody could spend a year\n out here ... alone....\"\n\n\n \"Ah ... in another month or so we'd be lousy company anyway,\" Alvar\n said. \"Maybe a guy could get to the point where he'd sleep most of the\n time ... just wake up enough times to give himself another boost with\n the old life-gun.\"\n\n\n \"We got to face it,\" Johnson said finally. \"We three don't go on\n together any more.\"\n\n\n \"That's it,\" said Alvar. \"There's three suns that look like they might\n be right seeing as how we all agree the old man was wrong. But we\n believe there is one we can live by, because we all seem to agree that\n the old man might have been right about that. If we stick together,\n the chance is three to one against us. But if each of us makes for one\n star, one of us has a chance to live. Maybe not in paradise like the\n old man said, but a place where we can live. And maybe there'll be\n intelligent life, maybe even a ship, and whoever gets the right star\n can come and help the other two....\"\n\n\n \"No ... God no....\" Russell whispered over and over. \"None of us can\n ever make it alone....\"\n\n\n Alvar said, \"We each take the star he likes best. I'll go back the\n other way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the\n right.\"\n\n\n Johnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and\n above his own yelling he could hear Johnson's rising laughter. \"Every\n guy's got a star of his own,\" Johnson said when he stopped laughing.\n \"And we got ours. A nice red-rimmed sun for each of us to call his\n very own.\"\n\n\n \"Okay,\" Alvar said. \"We cut off the gravity rope, and each to his own\n sun.\"\n\n\n Now Russell wasn't saying anything.\n\n\n \"And the old man,\" Alvar said, \"can keep right on going toward what he\n thought was right. And he'll keep on going. Course he won't be able to\n give himself another boost with the life-gun, but he'll keep going.\n Someday he'll get to that red-rimmed star of his. Out here in space,\n once you're going, you never stop ... and I guess there isn't any\n other body to pull him off his course. And what will time matter to\n old Dunbar? Even less than to us, I guess. He's dead and he won't\n care.\"\n\n\n \"Ready,\" Johnson said. \"I'll cut off the gravity rope.\"\n\n\n \"I'm ready,\" Alvar said. \"To go back toward whatever it was I started\n from.\"\n\n\n \"Ready, Russ?\"\n\n\n Russell couldn't say anything. He stared at the endless void which now\n he would share with no one. Not even crazy old Dunbar.\n\n\n \"All right,\" Johnson said. \"Good-bye.\"\n\n\n Russell felt the release, felt the sudden inexplicable isolation and\n aloneness even before Alvar and Johnson used their life-guns and shot\n out of sight, Johnson toward the left and Alvar back toward that other\n red-rimmed sun behind them.\n\n\n And old Dunbar shooting right on ahead. And all three of them\n dwindling and dwindling and blinking out like little lights.\n\n\n Fading, he could hear their voices. \"Each to his own star,\" Johnson\n said. \"On a bee line.\"\n\n\n \"On a bee line,\" Alvar said.\n\n\n Russell used his own life-gun and in a little while he didn't hear\n Alvar or Johnson's voices, nor could he see them. They were thousands\n of miles away, and going further all the time.\n\n\n Russell's head fell forward against the front of his helmet, and he\n closed his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"I shouldn't have killed the old\n man. Maybe one sun's as good as another....\"\n\n\n Then he raised his body and looked out into the year of blackness that\n waited for him, stretching away to the red-rimmed sun. Even if he were\n right\u2014he was sure now he'd never make it alone.\nThe body inside the pressure suit drifted into a low-level orbit\n around the second planet from the sun of its choice, and drifted there\n a long time. A strato-cruiser detected it by chance because of the\n strong concentration of radio-activity that came from it.\n\n\n They took the body down to one of the small, quiet towns on the edge\n of one of the many blue lakes where the domed houses were like bright\n joyful jewels. They got the leathery, well-preserved body from the\n pressure suit.\n\n\n \"An old man,\" one of them mused. \"A very old man. From one of the lost\n sectors. I wonder how and why he came so very far from his home?\"\n\n\n \"Wrecked a ship out there, probably,\" one of the others said. \"But he\n managed to get this far. It looks as though a small meteor fragment\n pierced his body. Here. You see?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" another of them said. \"But what amazes me is that this old man\n picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire\n sector that would sustain life.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he was just a very lucky old man. Yes ... a man who attains\n such an age was usually lucky. Or at least that is what they say about\n the lost sectors.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe he knew the way here. Maybe he was here before\u2014sometime.\"\n\n\n The other shook his head. \"I don't think so. They say some humans from\n that far sector did land here\u2014but that's probably only a myth. And if\n they did, it was well over a thousand years ago.\"\n\n\n Another said. \"He has a fine face, this old man. A noble face. Whoever\n he is ... wherever he came from, he died bravely and he knew the way,\n though he never reached this haven of the lost alive.\"\n\n\n \"Nor is it irony that he reached here dead,\" said the Lake Chieftain.\n He had been listening and he stepped forward and raised his arm. \"He\n was old. It is obvious that he fought bravely, that he had great\n courage, and that he knew the way. He will be given a burial suitable\n to his stature, and he will rest here among the brave.\n\n\n \"Let the women dance and the music play for this old man. Let the\n trumpets speak, and the rockets fly up. And let flowers be strewn over\n the path above which the women will carry him to rest.\"\n",

Beyond Russell's hunch, the text contains several elements that illustrate flawed reasoning and reveal the sentiments of the other men regarding Dunbar and their own instincts for survival. For instance, Russell struggles with the reality of their situation and projections of madness, suggesting a distraction from a more logical approach. As he muses about their predicament, he thinks, \"I know we're going right,\" showcasing a conflict where his emotions rather than clear reasoning are dictating his belief in the wrong direction.\n\nMoreover, Russell's interactions with Johnson and Alvar illuminate their varying perspectives on Dunbar. When Dunbar confidently states they will reach Paradise, Alvar displays doubt but also a flicker of hope, asking Dunbar directly, \"You still say that, Dunbar?\" This indicates that Alvar is wrestling with faith in Dunbar\u2019s knowledge, contrasting Russell's outright dismissal. Johnson's response to Russell's urging for caution is fraught with skepticism towards Russell's viewpoint; he comments, \"We got to decide now. Let's forget the old man,\" which shows a willingness among the group to move on without considering Dunbar\u2019s intentions further. \n\nThese exchanges reveal that the men are fracturing under pressure, as they grapple with the fear of the unknown and their own survival instincts. Their hesitance to unite under Dunbar's leadership ultimately highlights their collective vulnerability. By killing Dunbar, Russell not only acts out of fear and paranoia but also signifies a breakdown in their group\u2019s cohesion, leading them further from the safety and survival they desperately seek. This illustrates a broader theme in the story: the dire consequences of mistrust when survival hinges on cooperation and unity against the vast uncertainties of space.",

As he grapples with the silence that follows Dunbar\u2019s death, it becomes clear that Russell's rejection of Dunbar's dreams only serves to replace one delusion with another\u2014his own solitary conviction that he can succeed on his own.\n\nThus, the irony culminates in the tragic realization that while he aimed to dismiss Dunbar's fantastical visions, Russell inadvertently succumbs to a similar kind of madness, now isolated with hopelessness and devoid of direction. This profound shift underscores how Russell's choice not only dismantles the connection to any viable path forward but also leads him into the very delusion he once abhorred, making the answer to the question unequivocally evident: after killing Dunbar, Russell indeed becomes just as delusional as Dunbar.",

I been here, long time back.\"\n    Fact 1.2: Russell's doubt about Dunbar's plan is based on actual observations of the different stars.\n        Quote 1.2: \"So now there's two suns with red rims around them.\"\nCounter-Premise 2: Russell's decision was not just a belief about a dead end, but rather a response to the immediate psychological distress caused by Dunbar's delusions.\nOpponent's Original Premise: Russell's decision to kill Dunbar was based on his belief that Dunbar was leading them to a dead end, despite the evidence that Dunbar had some experience in the sector.\n    Fact 2.1: Russell's rising frustration highlights his deteriorating mental state, driven by the effect of Dunbar's erratic behavior on the group dynamics.\n        Quote 2.1: \"You're still sure it's the sun up ahead ... that's the only one with life on it, Dunbar ... the only one we can live on?\"\nCounter-Premise 3: Russell's actions were a means to reclaim agency in a situation spiraling toward madness, not merely an act of reckless abandonment of safety.\nOpponent's Original Premise: By choosing to act on his doubts instead of trusting Dunbar\u2019s knowledge, Russell not only dooms himself but also prevents the possibility that the group could find safety together.\n    Fact 3.1: After Dunbar's death, the group reflects on their course of action, indicating a shared understanding of their plight.\n        Quote 3.1: \"We got to decide now. Let's forget the old man. Let's forget him and all that's gone and let's start now and decide what to do.\"\nConclusion: In conclusion, Russell's ironic downfall stems from a desperate attempt to distance himself from a spiraling insanity that Dunbar represented, rather than a calculated move towards survival.

I remember those four suns all spotted to form a perfect circle from this point, with us squarely in the middle.\n    Fact 1.2: If they had followed him, they would have had hope and direction amidst the darkness of space.\n        Quote 1.2: What's a year when we know we're getting to Paradise at the end of it?\n    Fact 1.3: The eventual discovery of a body that reached a livable planet supports Dunbar's claim about the existence of a safe destination.\n        Quote 1.3: He picked this planet out of all the others. The only one in this entire sector that would sustain life.\nPremise 2: Russell's decision to kill Dunbar was driven by fear and paranoia, leading to a breakdown in group cohesion and eventual demise.\n    Fact 2.1: His impulsive act severed their collective chance of survival and plunged him into deeper isolation.\n        Quote 2.1: None of us can ever make it alone.\n    Fact 2.2: Russell's mental state deteriorated after he killed Dunbar, highlighting the futility of his act against perceived madness.\n        Quote 2.2: Even if he were right\u2014he was sure now he'd never make it alone.\n    Fact 2.3: Ultimately, Russell's actions resulted in his loss of direction, illustrating that trust and unity were key to survival.\n        Quote 2.3: Maybe, I thought, I shouldn't have killed the old man.\nConclusion: Thus, the irony lies in the fact that if the four men had followed Dunbar, they all would have survived, whereas Russell's choice to kill him ultimately led to their ruin.",
