The First Vice-President\n \nwas a cool cat\u2014the elevator and the\n \nmoney operators all wore earmuffs\u2014was\n \njust as phony as a three-dollar bill!\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nI\n\n\n The First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank and\n Trust Company, the gentleman to whom Miss Orison McCall was applying\n for a job, was not at all the public picture of a banker. His suit of\n hound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his\n jacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious\n bank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really\n swing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you\n come on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\n\n\n \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from\n staring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of\n furry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\n\n\n Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color\n bread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Beg pardon?\"\n\n\n \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and\n down on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\n\n\n \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\n\n\n \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n \"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught\n Orison's look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he\n explained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work\n in a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's a\n hunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\"\n\n\n \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed.\n\n\n \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with\n athletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell\n you, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around\n this tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of\n elevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\n to Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\n than Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\n Mr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n \"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\n and floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\n Curtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\n now that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n\n\n The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\n hold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\n a microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n \"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\n\n \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n\n\n The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n \"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\n get done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\n read. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a\n secretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\n with the Bank's operation?\"\n\n\n \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\n there paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to\n ask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\n coffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take\n care of these details now? Or would you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems\n best to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's\n might explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's\n secretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,\n girl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket,\n unfolded it to discover the day's\nWall Street Journal\n, and began at\n the top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,\n nodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\n \"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\n\n\n Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the\n one into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then\n took off upstairs in the elevator.\nBy lunchtime Orison had finished the\nWall Street Journal\nand had\n begun reading a book an earmuffed page had brought her. The book was a\n fantastic novel of some sort, named\nThe Hobbit\n. Reading this peculiar\n fare into the microphone before her, Miss McCall was more certain than\n ever that the Taft Bank was, as her boss in Washington had told her,\n the front for some highly irregular goings-on. An odd business for a\n Federal Mata Hari, Orison thought, reading a nonsense story into a\n microphone for an invisible audience.\n\n\n Orison switched off her microphone at noon, marked her place in the\n book and took the elevator down to the ground floor. The operator was\n a new man, ears concealed behind scarlet earmuffs. In the car, coming\n down from the interdicted upper floors, were several gentlemen with\n briefcases. As though they were members of a ballet-troupe, these\n gentlemen whipped off their hats with a single motion as Orison stepped\n aboard the elevator. Each of the chivalrous men, hat pressed to his\n heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. Orison nodded bemused acknowledgment\n of their gesture, and got off in the lobby vowing never to put a penny\n into this curiousest of banks.\n\n\n Lunch at the stand-up counter down the street was a normal interlude.\n Girls from the ground-floor offices of Taft Bank chattered together,\n eyed Orison with the coolness due so attractive a competitor, and\n favored her with no gambit to enter their conversations. Orison sighed,\n finished her tuna salad on whole-wheat, then went back upstairs to her\n lonely desk and her microphone. By five, Orison had finished the book,\n reading rapidly and becoming despite herself engrossed in the saga of\n Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. She switched off the microphone, put on her\n light coat, and rode downstairs in an elevator filled with earmuffed,\n silent, hat-clasping gentlemen.\n\n\n What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a\n double Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard\n Taft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of\n the U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association.\n Earmuffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read into a microphone. A Vice-President\n with the vocabulary of a racetrack tout. And what goes on in those\n upper floors? Orison stopped in at the restaurant nearest her apartment\n house\u2014the Windsor Arms\u2014and ordered a meal and a single Martini. Her\n boss in Washington had told her that this job of hers, spying on Taft\n Bank from within, might prove dangerous. Indeed it was, she thought.\n She was in danger of becoming a solitary drinker.\n\n\n Home in her apartment, Orison set the notes of her first day's\n observations in order. Presumably Washington would call tonight for\n her initial report. Item: some of the men at the Bank wore earmuffs,\n several didn't. Item: the Vice-President's name was Mr. Wanji:\n Oriental? Item: the top eight floors of the Taft Bank Building seemed\n to be off-limits to all personnel not wearing earmuffs. Item: she was\n being employed at a very respectable salary to read newsprint and\n nonsense into a microphone. Let Washington make sense of that, she\n thought.\nIn a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\n o'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\n of her first day's spying.\n\n\n No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\n was set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\n Perhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\n had her phone tapped.\n\n\n \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n\n\n Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\n said.\n\n\n \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\n Do you read me? Over.\"\n\n\n Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\n she reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n\n\n The room was empty.\n\n\n \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n\n\n \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\n Who are you?\"\n\n\n \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\n have anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n\n\n \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n\n\n \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\n to your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n\n\n Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n\n\n \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\n beside her.\n\n\n Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\n asked.\n\n\n \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\n security. Have you anything to report?\"\n\n\n \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\n time?\"\n\n\n \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\n establish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\n every day?\"\n\n\n \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n\n\n \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n \"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n\n\n Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\n microphone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\n National Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\n into a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n\n\n \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\n a peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\n placed the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n\n\n Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\n to write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\n registered mail.\nII\n\n\n At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\nWall Street Journal\n, Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\n of leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\n was bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\n wearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\n President of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\n little family.\"\n\n\n \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\n So tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\n Maybe higher heels?\n\n\n \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\n the chair to the right of her desk.\n\n\n \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n\n\n \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\n reasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n\n\n \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\n as though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\n designation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\n to keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\n and dictate it?\"\n\n\n \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\n presence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n\n\n \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\n asked, as though following her train of thought.\n\n\n \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\n financial organization.\"\n\n\n \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\n to them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\n with calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\n your using it.\"\n\n\n \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n\n\n \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\n evening?\"\n\n\n Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\n still so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n\n\n \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n\n\n \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\n playing, from the elevator.\n\n\n \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\n personnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\n and bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\n Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\n curtsy? Orison wondered.\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" she said.\n\n\n He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\n stayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\n to the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\n saw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\n not their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\n Small bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\nOrison finished the\nWall Street Journal\nby early afternoon. A\n page came up a moment later with fresh reading-matter: a copy of\n yesterday's\nCongressional Record\n. She launched into the\nRecord\n,\n thinking as she read of meeting again this evening that handsome\n madman, that splendid lunatic, that unlikely bank-president. \"You read\n so\nwell\n, darling,\" someone said across the desk.\n\n\n Orison looked up. \"Oh, hello,\" she said. \"I didn't hear you come up.\"\n\n\n \"I walk ever so lightly,\" the woman said, standing hip-shot in front\n of the desk, \"and pounce ever so hard.\" She smiled. Opulent, Orison\n thought. Built like a burlesque queen. No, she thought, I don't like\n her. Can't. Wouldn't if I could. Never cared for cats.\n\n\n \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing\n teeth.\n\n\n \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm\n Auga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\n\n\n \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\n\n\n \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to\n visit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.\n One for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\n\n\n \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to\n draw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding\u2014you know, the\n shoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should\n you throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little\n eyes scratched out. Word to the wise,\nn'est-ce pas\n?\"\n\n\n \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her\nWall\n Street Journal\ninto a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\n\n\n \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here.\n You could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of\n annoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\n\n\n \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to\n your stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\"\n\n\n \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right\n off?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator,\n displaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba\n motion.\n\n\n The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,\n stepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\n\n\n \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,\n he stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\n\n\n \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused\n and shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ...\n Vingt thing....\"\n\n\n \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\n\n\n \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\n\n\n \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank\n and Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding,\n Dink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped\n even closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch\n of frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The\n head, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's\n spike-topped\nPickelhauben\n; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed\n normal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed\u2014what continental manners these bankers\n had!\u2014and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up\n paper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.\nInstead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and\n said, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,\n Miss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing\n business with pleasure.\"\n\n\n Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she\n shouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I\n care. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in\n finance, and listen to another word.\"\n\n\n \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,\n a bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most\n charming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,\n dear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to\n the wise....\"\n\n\n \"\nN'est-ce pas?\n\" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the\n foolish. Get lost.\"\n\n\n Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\n\n\n \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind\n you. Push a button, will you? And\nbon voyage\n.\"\n\n\n Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with\n a cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above\n fifth floor.\n\n\n First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.\n Surely, Orison thought, recovering the\nWall Street Journal\nfrom her\n wastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern\n bank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior\n of the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\n thought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\n and all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\n finished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\n upper floors.\n\n\n Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\n sudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \"\nWanji e-Kal, Datto.\n Dink ger-Dink d'summa.\n\"\n\n\n Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before\n replying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\"\n\n\n \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda\n clutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see\n him, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down.\n What now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language\n Mr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by\n tonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\n it out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\n she had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\n only fire her.\n\n\n Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\n be here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.\n The elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\n off the upstairs floors.\n\n\n But the building had a stairway.\nIII\n\n\n The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\n seven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\n the landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\n was a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\n fringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n\n\n She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n\n\n Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\n extended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\n its ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\n galvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\n Orison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\n and eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\n strands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\n pink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\n full of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\n Orison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\n liquid. Then she screamed.\nThe pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\n the spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\n upon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\n leaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\n put her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\n stairway door.\n\n\n Into a pair of arms.\n\n\n \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\n Orison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\n her wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\n Gerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he\n said. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were\n we to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against\n her two\nsumo\n-sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by\n some quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the\n floor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted\n all around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of\n course, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of\n calcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within\n minutes.\"\n\n\n \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of\n the earmuffed\nsumo\n-wrestlers protested.\n\n\n \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you\n must tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.\"\n\n\n \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\n\n\n \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of\n damsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the\n bank.\"\n\n\n \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you\n acromegalic apes!\"\n\n\n \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\n\n\n \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\"\nSuddenly she was dropped. Her mountainous keepers were on the floor as\n though struck by lightning, their arms thrown out before them, their\n faces abject against the floor. Kraft Gerding was slowly lowering\n himself to one knee. Dink had entered the spider-room. Without\n questions, he strode between the shiko-ing Earmuffs and put his arms\n around Orison.\n\n\n \"They can't harm you,\" he said. She turned to press her face against\n his chest. \"You're all right, child. Breathe deep, swallow, and turn\n your brain back on. All right, now?\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" she said, still trembling. \"They were going to throw me to\n the spiders.\"\n\n\n \"Kraft told you that?\" Dink Gerding released her and turned to the\n kneeling man. \"Stand up, Elder Brother.\"\n\n\n \"I....\"\n\n\n Dink brought his right fist up from hip-level, crashing it into Kraft's\n jaw. Kraft Gerding joined the Earmuffs on the floor.\n\n\n \"If you'd care to stand again, Elder Brother, you may attempt to\n recover your dignity without regard for the difference in our rank.\"\n Kraft struggled to one knee and remained kneeling, gazing up at Dink\n through half-closed eyes. \"No? Then get out of here, all of you.\nSamma!\n\"\n\n\n Kraft Gerding arose, stared for a moment at Dink and Orison, then, with\n the merest hint of a bow, led his two giant Earmuffs to the elevator.\n\n\n \"I wish you hadn't come up here, Orison,\" Dink said. \"Why did you do\n it?\"\n\n\n \"Have you read the story of Bluebeard?\" Orison asked. She stood close\n to Dink, keeping her eyes on the nearest spidertank. \"I had to see\n what it was you kept up here so secretly, what it was that I was\n forbidden to see. My excuse was to have been that I was looking for\n you, to deliver a message from Mr. Wanji. He said I was to tell you\n that the escudo green is pale.\"\n\n\n \"You're too curious, and Wanji is too careless,\" Dink said. \"Now, what\n is this thing you have about spiders?\"\n\n\n \"I've always been terrified of them,\" Orison said. \"When I was a little\n girl, I had to stay upstairs all day one Sunday because there was a\n spider hanging from his thread in the stairway. I waited until Dad came\n home and took it down with a broom. Even then, I didn't have appetite\n for supper.\"\n\n\n \"Strange,\" Dink said. He walked over to the nearest tank and plucked\n one of the tiny pink creatures from a web-bridge. \"This is no spider,\n Orison,\" he said.\n\n\n She backed away from Dink Gerding and the minuscule creature he cupped\n in the palm of his hand. \"These are Microfabridae, more nearly related\n to shellfish than to spiders,\" he said. \"They're stone-and-metal\n eaters. They literally couldn't harm a fly. Look at it, Orison.\" He\n extended his palm. Orison forced herself to look. The little creature,\n flesh-colored against his flesh, was nearly invisible, scuttling around\n the bowl of his hand. \"Pretty little fellow, isn't he?\" Dink asked.\n \"Here. You hold him.\"\n\n\n \"I'd rather not,\" she protested.\n\n\n \"I'd be happier if you did,\" Dink said.\nOrison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the\n Microfabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like\n a legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and\n unfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm.\n\n\n \"He's like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said.\n\n\n \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial\n process we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and\n secret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\"\n\n\n \"What do they do?\" Orison asked.\n\n\n \"That's still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can't tell even you\n that, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.\"\n\n\n \"What's he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus,\n perched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching\n against her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.\n\n\n \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder,\n comfortably close. \"They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as\n children are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison.\n We'd better get you down where you belong.\"\n\n\n Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest\n tank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring.\n It was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange,\n using crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I\n thought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something\n like the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\n\n\n \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing\n together while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He\n took her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these\n little workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\n\n\n Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to\n the music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,\n storm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace\n and harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash\n of breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the\n quiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\n \"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been\n singing it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a\n wood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\n \"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\n \"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\n\n\n Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the\n mineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the\n liquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\n \"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she\n thought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling\n life. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.\n",

When they first meet, Dink welcomes her warmly, stating, \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" which is a sentiment that resonates with Orison. Furthermore, after Orison is threatened by Kraft and his Earmuffs, Dink reassures her, saying, \"They can't harm you,\" and demonstrates a protective instinct that strengthens Orison's trust in him.

This is important as many of her other colleagues demonstrate odd and disrespectful behavior. A pivotal moment occurs when Dink rescues Orison from Kraft Gerding's intimidating threats. After Orison expresses her fear of being thrown to the spiders, Dink immediately asserts, \"You're all right, child,\" demonstrating both concern and reassurance. This protective instinct solidifies Orison's trust in him, as Dink stands up to his brother, showcasing not only his authority but also his genuine care for her well-being. Finally, when they share a moment of intimacy as Dink introduces her to the Microfabridae and speaks of their song, the comfort and connection they establish reinforce her growing trust in him, allowing her to lean back into Dink's arms and listen to the music he describes.

Mr. Wanji, the Vice-President, engages in eccentric conversations filled with slang and casual language that makes Orison feel out of place, as seen when he asks her, \"What color bread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" This peculiar demeanor, along with the oddity of employees wearing earmuffs and the overall strange atmosphere of the bank, heightens her sense of distrust. Similarly, Kraft Gerding's aggressive demeanor and his warning to Orison that she should not mix business with pleasure paint him as an antagonistic figure. His possessive attitude over Dink and intimidating behavior indicate to Orison that he might prioritize his interests over her safety. In contrast, Dink's respectful approach and willingness to protect her during moments of crisis, saying reassuringly, \"They can't harm you,\" present him as a reliable ally. These interactions create a clear distinction between Dink's nurturing behavior and the unsettling presence of his colleagues, illustrating why Orison ultimately places her trust in Dink Gerding as the only person she feels she can rely on in the chaotic environment of the Taft Bank.",

Her initial response of \u201cWe've hardly met\u201d to his invitation for dinner indicates that she is guarded and uncertain about becoming more personally involved with him. Additionally, when she is warned by Auga Vingt about Dink's potential intentions, Orison's instinct to be wary is evident as she contemplates the competitive dynamics at play.\n\nHowever, Orison reconciles these feelings of doubt with her overall trust in Dink as she observes his actions and mannerisms. Unlike other bank employees, Dink behaves with kindness and respect, addressing her directly and valuing her contributions, which gradually puts her at ease. His protective reaction during the confrontation with Kraft and the way he comforts her following the scare with the spiders, saying, \"You're all right,\" serves as pivotal moments that reinforce her trust. Ultimately, Orison\u2019s initial hesitations are overshadowed by Dink\u2019s consistent empathy and regard for her safety, allowing her to move beyond her doubts and embrace the bond they are forming.",

For instance, she reflects, \"What I need, Orison thought, walking rapidly to the busline, is a double Scotch, followed by a double Scotch. And what the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company needs is a joint raid by forces of the U.S. Treasury Department and the American Psychiatric Association.\" This sentiment demonstrates her lack of confidence in the integrity of her surroundings. Additionally, her encounter with Kraft Gerding, the bank's president, only solidifies her feelings of suspicion. When he warns her against mixing business with pleasure, it further alienates her, leading her to conclude that \"no one would convert a major Midwestern bank into a lunatic asylum,\" showcasing her apprehension about their true nature.

Even when she has a positive conversation with Dink, where he invites her to dinner, the undercurrents of her thoughts suggest she's hesitant and unsure about his true intentions. For example, her immediate recollection of Kraft Gerding's earlier warning speaks volumes about her lack of trust: she feels \"target\" for attention from the men in the bank, further underlying her discomfort.\n\nAdditionally, during a moment of confrontation with Kraft Gerding, where he warns her against mixing business with pleasure, her reaction is one of defiance and rejection as she emphatically declares, \u201cI quit!\u201d This type of strong objection to perceived threats indicates that any chance of trust is nonexistent.

Though she appreciates Dink\u2019s manners and finds him appealing, her predominant emotion is unease regarding the situation at the Taft Bank and the strange behavior of its employees.\n\nA brief glimpse of her conflicting feelings can be found when she thinks, \"Perhaps he\u2019s interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\" This suggests a flicker of hope or attraction towards Dink but is quickly tempered by her overall distrust. Furthermore, when Dink is kind and respectful, offering help in an informal manner, it doesn't erase her apprehension. Her engagement with him is marred by the broader context of her experiences, leading her to reflect on Dink's position and the implications of his suggestion to use first names, which could create discomfort in a professional context.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle acknowledgment when she thinks back on Dink's warning to her about his brother, finding it slightly protective, which could hint at a measure of comfort. Yet overall, these moments are overcast by her cognitive judgment against the backdrop of her escalating suspicion of the bank as a whole. She remains in a state of reluctance and fear, demonstrating that trust is consistently overridden by her wariness towards nearly everyone she encounters at the bank.

Initially, Dink's warm, engaging demeanor impresses Orison when he welcomes her to the bank and invites her to dinner without pretense, prompting her to express enthusiasm for their meeting. For instance, she responds positively to his dinner invitation with, \"I'd love to,\" revealing her openness to him. As the narrative progresses, Dink demonstrates not only charm but also protectiveness; when Orison is threatened by Kraft Gerding's intrusive behavior, it is Dink who intervenes, showcasing his concern for her well-being. He physically defends her by confronting Kraft, stating, \"Get out of here, all of you,\" which highlights his loyalty and willingness to protect her. Furthermore, Dink's explanations about the strange happenings within the bank, such as the creatures in the spider tanks, display a level of transparency that contrasts starkly with the secretive nature of Mr. Wanji and Kraft. By the end of her encounter with Dink, Orison recognizes him not just as a colleague but as someone she can rely on amidst the chaos of the bank, especially when he comforts her after her initial fright with the Microfabridae, saying, \"They can't harm you.\" These moments of support and openness effectively cement Dink as the singular figure Orison can trust, distinguishing him from the other eccentric and unsettling characters at the bank, ultimately affirming Dink Gerding as her trusted ally.",

Her perception of Dink as a trustworthy and dependable figure allows her to navigate the unusual and often unsettling environment of the bank with more confidence. For example, she feels empowered to confront characters like Kraft Gerding, knowing that Dink provides a supportive backdrop to her experiences. When Kraft attempts to intimidate her with his warnings about Dink, Orison\u2019s dismissal of his threats is propelled by her trust in Dink, as she feels assured that he will stand by her side.\n\nAdditionally, Orison's interactions with other employees are marked by a palpable wariness. Given the oddity of Mr. Wanji\u2019s behavior, with his unusual attire and casual lingo, Orison remains cautious, viewing him as part of the bank's disturbing atmosphere. Similarly, the hostile encounter with Auga Vingt causes Orison to adopt a defensive attitude, \"I quit!\" she boldly declares, suggesting that she feels threatened and unsupported among her peers except for Dink. Her trust in him contrasts sharply with her suspicions of others, ultimately influencing her decisions. Rather than feeling vulnerable and confused by the bizarre happenings in the bank, she channels her trust into a resolve to understand and uncover the secrets of the institution, encouraged by the safety that Dink represents. This dynamic encapsulates how Orison\u2019s trust shapes her interactions, instilling her with a sense of agency as she navigates the complexities of her work environment, particularly as she investigates the true nature of the Taft Bank under Dink's guidance.",

Additionally, when Gerding tells her that her position is important and asks her to use his first name, she thinks, \"Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and still so young,\" implying skepticism about his qualifications and judgment.\n\nFurthermore, during their conversation about her job, Gerding asserts, \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used to them.\" Orison's internal response to his words is telling: she thinks of him as \"a kookie\" figure, which indicates a lack of confidence in his leadership and the institution's operations. Unlike her interactions with more eccentric characters, like Auga Vingt and Kraft Gerding, where her sarcasm and dismissiveness are more overt, with Dink, she maintains a level of politeness, albeit laced with uncertainty, suggesting that her mistrust towards him is couched in a mix of fascination and apprehension.

Yet, this trust is not without tension, as Kraft's warnings about Dink introduce a layer of complexity in Orison's perception. These moments create an ambivalence in her feelings; she acknowledges Dink as a potential ally, but remains conscious of the deceitful undertones surrounding her workplace.\n\nTherefore, the interplay of Dink's genuine efforts to support her against the backdrop of the bank's oddities reveals a multi-dimensional relationship. Orison's growing trust in Dink stands in stark contrast to her overall skepticism toward the bank and its employees, illustrating a nuanced dynamic that reflects both hope and caution in her psyche.",

Throughout the article, Dink's respectful demeanor and protective instincts establish him as the sole figure with whom Orison feels a sense of connection. He treats her with kindness and validation, evident in his statement, \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" and he fosters a sense of safety when he reassures her, \"They can't harm you,\" in the spider room.

The complexity of her feelings only deepens the authentic connection she finds in Dink, as her instinct to spy and report reflects a broader wariness towards her surroundings, yet does not extend to him. Therefore, the evidence consistently points to Dink Gerding as the only person Orison seems to trust within the chaotic and suspicious realm of the William Howard Taft National Bank.

Throughout the story, she continuously grapples with her overall suspicion and unease regarding the operations and culture at the William Howard Taft National Bank. Despite Dink's moments of kindness, Orison's trust remains superficial, significantly influenced by her impression of the bizarre environment in which she feels confined and threatened.\n\nInstances showcasing her discomfort\u2014such as her thoughts about the need for a raid by the Treasury or her decision to act as a spy\u2014illustrate a pervasive distrust that colors her perception of everyone at the bank, including Dink. His caring demeanor is juxtaposed with Kraft Gerding's manipulative comments, which serve to highlight a troubling dynamic rather than genuinely alleviate her concerns. Ultimately, Orison\u2019s conflicting feelings and her careful monitoring of the situation suggest that her sense of safety and trust is never fully realized with Dink. The scrutiny she applies to him, alongside her acknowledgment of the bizarre and dangerous atmosphere surrounding her, leads to the conclusion that she cannot place her trust in anyone at the bank, and thus, the answer is indeed 'no one - they all seem suspicious.'",

Moreover, when confronted with the terrifying reality of the spider tanks, it is Dink who comforts her and protects her, thus solidifying a bond of trust. The warning from Kraft Gerding does indeed add to the chaotic environment; however, Orison's decision to confide in Dink and her willingness to accept his invitation for dinner further highlight her inclination to trust him, unlike any other character at the bank. Therefore, while her overall suspicion may prevail in the broader context, it is clear that Dink stands apart and earns her trust amid the strangeness of the Taft Bank.",

Furthermore, even her willingness to go to dinner with him can stem from curiosity rather than genuine trust.

His immediate protective response and reassuring words (\"They can't harm you\") act as a counterbalance to her initial fear, allowing her to see him as a trustworthy ally.

Despite the pervasive sense of danger surrounding her, Orison displays a distinct affinity for Dink, marked by both admiration and a desire for connection. Her acknowledgment of Dink being \u201ca handsome man\u201d and their shift towards a first-name basis reflect her openness and comfort with him, which is absent in her interactions with others. Furthermore, when he comforts her after her frightening encounter in the spider room, saying, \u201cThey can\u2019t harm you,\u201d it underscores the protective role he assumes in her life, suggesting that she perceives him as an ally rather than a threat.\n\nThis relationship culminates in her willingness to engage with Dink, as evidenced by her acceptance of his invitation to dinner. Such a willingness indicates a level of trust that is not extended to anyone else in the bank, reflecting Orison\u2019s internal conflict between attraction and caution. Although she navigates the broader atmosphere of suspicion, Dink emerges as a notable exception in her experience\u2014one she is drawn to and can trust to a certain degree. Therefore, the assertion that Dink Gerding is the only person Orison trusts in the bank is firmly supported by their interactions and her evolving perceptions of him throughout the narrative.",
