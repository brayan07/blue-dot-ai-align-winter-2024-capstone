    "article": "Bodyguard\nBy CHRISTOPHER GRIMM\n\n\n Illustrated by CAVAT\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nWhen overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course\n \na man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that\n \nhe had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!\nThe man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did\n the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in\n the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\n\n\n Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the\n humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and\n arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior\n to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was\n accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was\n almost ordinary-looking.\n\n\n As for the extraterrestrials\u2014it was a free bar\u2014they were merely\n amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably\n hideous.\n\n\n Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a\n short man standing next to the pair\u2014young, as most men and women were\n in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though\n not death\u2014but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic\n surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.\n\n\n The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his\n clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather\n ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one\u2014or at least he felt\n he was, which was what mattered.\n\n\n \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me\n buy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the\n same for my fellow-man here.\"\n\n\n The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth\n hastily supplied by the management.\n\n\n \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out\n his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look\n at them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\"\nYou could use one\nwas implied.\n\n\n And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,\n was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just\n set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's\n handsome face.\nSuddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. \"Don't do that,\" the\n nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed\n the glass from the little man's slackening grasp. \"You wouldn't want to\n go to jail because of him.\"\n\n\n The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces\n now ranged against him\u2014including his own belated prudence\u2014were too\n strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to\n smash back, and now it was too late for that.\n\n\n Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. \"So, it's you again?\"\n\n\n The man in the gray suit smiled. \"Who else in any world would stand up\n for you?\"\n\n\n \"I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you\n around, of course,\" Gabriel added too quickly. \"You do come in useful\n at times, you know.\"\n\n\n \"So you don't mind having me around?\" The nondescript man smiled again.\n \"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from\n yourself\u2014you lost yourself a while back, remember?\"\n\n\n Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. \"Come on, have a drink\n with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you\n something\u2014I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.\"\n\n\n \"I drank with you once too often,\" the nondescript man said. \"And\n things worked out fine, didn't they? For you.\" His eyes studied the\n other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of\n bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were\n not pleased with what they saw. \"Watch yourself, colleague,\" he warned\n as he left. \"Soon you might not be worth the saving.\"\n\n\n \"Who was that, Gabe?\" the girl asked.\n\n\n He shrugged. \"I never saw him before in my life.\" Of course, knowing\n him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he\n happened to have been telling the truth.\nOnce the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\n suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\n he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\n that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\n coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\n reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\n the letter combination\nbodyguard\n, he went out into the street.\n\n\n If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\n been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\n identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\n years.\n\n\n The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\n the driver asked.\n\n\n \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n\n\n \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n\n\n But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n\n\n \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\n wanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n\n\n \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n\n\n The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\n teleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\n suicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n\n\n \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\n smile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\n happens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\n thrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\n which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n\n\n \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\n window. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\n cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\n anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n\n\n \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\n commission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n\n\n \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n\n\n \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n\n\n \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\nII\n\n\n It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\n condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n\n\n \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\n shook his handsome head.\n\n\n \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\n referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\n and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n\n\n Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\n when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\n town, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\n on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\n short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n\n\n To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\n the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\n young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\n at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\n remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\n before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n\n\n Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\n speculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\n a little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\n thrown me back in.\"\n\n\n \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n\n\n The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\n that he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n\n\n \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\n glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n\n\n \"\nMrs.\n,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\n Lockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n \"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n\n\n \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\n looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\n from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\n you'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\n car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\n Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n\n\n There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\n lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\n newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\n beginning to slide downhill....\n\n\n Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\nThere was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,\n which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and\n his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket\n closer about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your\u2014your\n friend to me, Gabe?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's\n no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\n\n\n \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification\n card from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and\n Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail\n milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks\n ago, and now he isn't ... anything.\"\n\n\n \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token\n of my\u2014of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier\n with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only\n casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation\n held little gratitude.\n\n\n The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money,\n thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\n \"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the\n future! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let\n something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\n\n\n Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise\u2014I'll be\n careful.\"\nWhen he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,\n the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi\n driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the\n commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others\n had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate\n or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known\n colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from\n one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you\n could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it\n extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.\n Perhaps\u2014and this was the most likely hypothesis\u2014he just didn't care.\n\n\n Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course\u2014so much so that there were\n many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word\n implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so\n deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\n \"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to\n zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly\n applied. And this was one crime\u2014for it was crime in law as well as\n nature\u2014in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;\n otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.\nPlaying the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it\n profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's\n seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien\n human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with\n interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many\n slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them\n zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.\n Which was why they came to Terra to make profits\u2014there has never been\n big money in musical chairs as such.\n\n\n When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent\u2014as\n they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the\n law\u2014they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court\n could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life\n spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital\n punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the\n terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons\n could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired\n after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because\n trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between\n Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance\n of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.\n\n\n The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in\n which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to\n conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.\n But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence\n of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive\n light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was\n the trouble in these smaller towns\u2014you ran greater risks of getting\n involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.\n\n\n The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,\n when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into\n darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to\n have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew\n everybody else far too well.\n\n\n The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in\n coming to such desolate, off-trail places\u2014hoping that eventually\n disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed\n too logical for the man he was haunting.\n\n\n However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the\n heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. \"One?\" the small green\n creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.\n\n\n \"One,\" the fat man answered.\nIII\n\n\n The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays\n from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile\n patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular\n features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine\n Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. \"Only\n weighted out,\" he muttered, \"he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you\n two to come out to a place like this?\"\n\n\n \"I really think Gabriel\nmust\nbe possessed....\" the girl said, mostly\n to herself. \"I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be\n until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.\n It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?\"\n\n\n \"It does indeed,\" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was\n growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect\n them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable\n and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.\n\n\n The girl looked closely at him. \"You look different, but you\nare\nthe\n same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before\n that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?\"\n\n\n The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. \"Yes, I'm all of\n them.\"\n\n\n \"Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people\n who go around changing their bodies like\u2014like hats?\" Automatically she\n reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale\n hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not\n been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.\nHe smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.\n\n\n \"But why do you do it?\nWhy!\nDo you like it? Or is it because of\n Gabriel?\" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here\n and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was\n included in its scope. \"Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;\n is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Ask him.\"\n\n\n \"He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I\n didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what\n we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I\n think?\"\n\n\n There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she\n wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or\n third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it\n respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she\n must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking\n for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,\n she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so\n casually.\nIt was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her\n husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat\u2014of fur taken from\n some animal who had lived and died light-years away\u2014more closely about\n herself. The thin young man began to cough again.\n\n\n Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk\n of the Moon and hurl itself upward\u2014one of the interstellar ships\n embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow\n she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a\n barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who\n followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of\n them would stay....\n\n\n \"If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,\" she asked, \"why then\n do you keep helping him?\"\n\n\n \"I am not helping\nhim\n. And he knows that.\"\n\n\n \"You'll change again tonight, won't you?\" she babbled. \"You always\n change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to\n identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's\n something about you that doesn't change.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad he got married,\" the young man said. \"I could have followed\n him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out\n from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,\" he added, his voice\n less impersonal, \"for your sake.\"\n\n\n She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but\n she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an\n outsider; he was part of their small family group\u2014as long as she had\n known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect\n that he was even more closely involved than that.\n\n\n \"Why must you change again?\" she persisted, obliquely approaching the\n subject she feared. \"You have a pretty good body there. Why run the\n risk of getting a bad one?\"\n\n\n \"This isn't a good body,\" he said. \"It's diseased. Sure, nobody's\n supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical\n examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading\n me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty\n of foliage.\"\n\n\n \"How\u2014long will it last you?\"\n\n\n \"Four or five months, if I'm careful.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry, if\n that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be\n expensive\u2014that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then\n it was tough on me too, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n \"But how did you get into this ... pursuit?\" she asked again. \"And why\n are you doing it?\" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard\n for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should\n know him better than most.\n\n\n \"Ask your husband.\"\n\n\n The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,\n snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,\n and stirred it with his toe. \"I'd better call a cab\u2014he might freeze to\n death.\"\n\n\n He signaled and a cab came.\n\n\n \"Tell him, when he comes to,\" he said to the girl as he and the driver\n lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, \"that I'm\n getting pretty tired of this.\" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.\n \"Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,\n in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.\"\n\"Sorry,\" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect\n except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, \"but I'm afraid you\n cannot play.\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.\n\n\n \"You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.\"\n\n\n \"But I have plenty of money.\" The young man coughed. The Vinzz\n shrugged. \"I'll pay you twice the regular fee.\"\n\n\n The green one shook his head. \"Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This\n game is really clean.\"\n\n\n \"In a town like this?\"\n\n\n \"That is the reason we can afford to be honest.\" The Vinzz' tendrils\n quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through\n long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His\n heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been\n velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung\n with him.\n\n\n \"We do a lot of business here,\" he said unnecessarily, for the whole\n set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by\n no means poor when it came to worldly goods. \"Why don't you try another\n town where they're not so particular?\"\n\n\n The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.\n He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.\n And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he\n wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was\n he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own\n discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact\n that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?\n Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the\n hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day\n win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original\n casing had?\n\n\n He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he\n would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl,\n seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened\n and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that\n the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand\n how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of\n information.\nThe Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they\n detached, and the first approached the man once more. \"There is, as it\n happens, a body available for a private game,\" he lisped. \"No questions\n to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good\n health.\"\n\n\n The man hesitated. \"But unable to pass the screening?\" he murmured\n aloud. \"A criminal then.\"\n\n\n The green one's face\u2014if you could call it a face\u2014remained impassive.\n\n\n \"Male?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate\n standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the\n curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it\n kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had\n also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials\n exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or\n biological impossibility, no one could tell.\n\n\n It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part\u2014if it had ever\n been proved that an alien life-form had \"desecrated\" a human body,\n Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held\n its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear\u2014and the Vinzz, despite\n being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had\n been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on\n Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,\n \"Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.\"\n\n\n \"It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take\n such a risk.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"How much?\"\n\n\n \"Thirty thousand credits.\"\n\n\n \"Why, that's three times the usual rate!\"\n\n\n \"The other will pay five times the usual rate.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, all right,\" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific\n risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he\n himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all\n the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.\nHe looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;\n tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to\n match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many\n people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the\n pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it\n was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\n student of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\n time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\n might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\n the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though\n not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the\n police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital\n punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the\n man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,\n nor whom the police intended to capture easily.\nThis might be a lucky break for me after all\n, the new tenant thought,\n as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious\n rude health, was not a very comfortable fit.\nI can do a lot with a\n hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe\n I'll be able to get away with it.\nIV\n\n\n \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you\n too well. And I know you have that man's\u2014the real Gabriel\n Lockard's\u2014body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she\n watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.\n\n\n Lockard\u2014Lockard's body, at any rate\u2014sat up and felt his unshaven\n chin. \"That what he tell you?\"\n\n\n \"No, he didn't tell me anything really\u2014just suggested I ask you\n whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he\n obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to\n see his body spoiled.\"\n\n\n \"It\nis\na pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles\n and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved\n at having someone with whom to share his secret.\n\n\n \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking\n at him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing.\n Gabe, why don't you...?\"\n\n\n \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.\n \"You'd like that, wouldn't you?

But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash\n that experience from her mind or her body.\n\n\n \"You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\"\n she went on. \"You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose,\n does he?\"\n\n\n \"I don't want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn't want it if I could get\n it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he\n looked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.\n \"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a\n hulk I had!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to\n match your character. Pity you could only change one.\"\n",

In his escapades into dangerous locations, we can see his strategy for dealing with the suffocating nature of his protector\u2014by engaging in activities that are as risky as they are enticing. \n\nOn the other hand, Gabe\u2019s specific intention to play zarquil is illustrated through the various references to the game's allure and the thrill it presents, such as when the article describes zarquil as \"fabulously expensive\" and \"extremely illegal.\" This dangerous aspect of the game serves as a powerful attractor for Gabe, showing that his visits to these seedy areas are not just about escaping but are also about the hedonistic pleasure and excitement that zarquil offers. \n\nUltimately, these examples encapsulate the complexity of Gabe's character: he is both a man in search of freedom from his vigilant bodyguard and someone drawn to the adrenaline rush provided by zarquil, reflecting the dual motivations that compel him to seek out perilous venues.",
