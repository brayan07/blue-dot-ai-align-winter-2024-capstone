    "article": "SECOND LANDING\nBy FLOYD WALLACE\nA gentle fancy for the Christmas Season\u2014an\n oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something\n that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer.\nEarth\n was so far away that\n it wasn't visible. Even the\n sun was only a twinkle. But this\n vast distance did not mean that\n isolation could endure forever.\n Instruments within the ship intercepted\n radio broadcasts and,\n within the hour, early TV signals.\n Machines compiled dictionaries\n and grammars and began\n translating the major languages.\n The history of the planet was\n tabulated as facts became available.\n\n\n The course of the ship changed\n slightly; it was not much out of\n the way to swing nearer Earth.\n For days the two within the ship\n listened and watched with little\n comment. They had to decide\n soon.\n\n\n \"We've got to make or break,\"\n said the first alien.\n\n\n \"You know what I'm in favor\n of,\" said the second.\n\n\n \"I can guess,\" said Ethaniel,\n who had spoken first. \"The place\n is a complete mess. They've never\n done anything except fight\n each other\u2014and invent better\n weapons.\"\n\n\n \"It's not what they've done,\"\n said Bal, the second alien. \"It's\n what they're going to do, with\n that big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"The more reason for stopping,\"\n said Ethaniel. \"The big\n bomb can destroy them. Without\n our help they may do just that.\"\n\n\n \"I may remind you that in two\n months twenty-nine days we're\n due in Willafours,\" said Bal.\n \"Without looking at the charts\n I can tell you we still have more\n than a hundred light-years to\n go.\"\n\n\n \"A week,\" said Ethaniel. \"We\n can spare a week and still get\n there on time.\"\n\n\n \"A week?\" said Bal. \"To settle\n their problems? They've had two\n world wars in one generation\n and that the third and final one\n is coming up you can't help feeling\n in everything they do.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take much,\" said\n Ethaniel. \"The wrong diplomatic\n move, or a trigger-happy soldier\n could set it off. And it wouldn't\n have to be deliberate. A meteor\n shower could pass over and their\n clumsy instruments could interpret\n it as an all-out enemy\n attack.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" said Bal. \"We'll\n just have to forget there ever\n was such a planet as Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Could you? Forget so many\n people?\"\n\n\n \"I'm doing it,\" said Bal. \"Just\n give them a little time and they\n won't be here to remind me that\n I have a conscience.\"\n\n\n \"My memory isn't convenient,\"\n said Ethaniel. \"I ask you\n to look at them.\"\nBal rustled, flicking the screen\n intently. \"Very much like ourselves,\"\n he said at last. \"A bit\n shorter perhaps, and most certainly\n incomplete. Except for the\n one thing they lack, and that's\n quite odd, they seem exactly like\n us. Is that what you wanted me\n to say?\"\n\n\n \"It is. The fact that they are\n an incomplete version of ourselves\n touches me. They actually\n seem defenseless, though I suppose\n they're not.\"\n\n\n \"Tough,\" said Bal. \"Nothing\n we can do about it.\"\n\n\n \"There is. We can give them\n a week.\"\n\n\n \"In a week we can't negate\n their entire history. We can't\n begin to undo the effect of the\n big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"You can't tell,\" said Ethaniel.\n \"We can look things over.\"\n\n\n \"And then what? How much\n authority do we have?\"\n\n\n \"Very little,\" conceded Ethaniel.\n \"Two minor officials on the\n way to Willafours\u2014and we run\n directly into a problem no one\n knew existed.\"\n\n\n \"And when we get to Willafours\n we'll be busy. It will be a\n long time before anyone comes\n this way again.\"\n\n\n \"A very long time. There's\n nothing in this region of space\n our people want,\" said Ethaniel.\n \"And how long can Earth last?\n Ten years? Even ten months?\n The tension is building by the\n hour.\"\n\n\n \"What can I say?\" said Bal.\n \"I suppose we can stop and look\n them over. We're not committing\n ourselves by looking.\"\n\n\n They went much closer to\n Earth, not intending to commit\n themselves. For a day they circled\n the planet, avoiding radar\n detection, which for them was\n not difficult, testing, and sampling.\n Finally Ethaniel looked up\n from the monitor screen. \"Any\n conclusions?\"\n\n\n \"What's there to think? It's\n worse than I imagined.\"\n\n\n \"In what way?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we knew they had the\n big bomb. Atmospheric analysis\n showed that as far away as we\n were.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"We also knew they could deliver\n the big bomb, presumably\n by some sort of aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"That was almost a certainty.\n They'd have no use for the big\n bomb without aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"What's worse is that I now\n find they also have missiles,\n range one thousand miles and\n upward. They either have or are\n near a primitive form of space\n travel.\"\n\n\n \"Bad,\" said Ethaniel. \"Sitting\n there, wondering when it's going\n to hit them. Nervousness could\n set it off.\"\n\n\n \"It could, and the missiles\n make it worse,\" said Bal. \"What\n did you find out at your end?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing worthwhile. I was\n looking at the people while you\n were investigating their weapons.\"\n\n\n \"You must think something.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I knew what to think.\n There's so little time,\" Ethaniel\n said. \"Language isn't the difficulty.\n Our machines translate\n their languages easily and I've\n taken a cram course in two or\n three of them. But that's not\n enough, looking at a few plays,\n listening to advertisements, music,\n and news bulletins. I should\n go down and live among them,\n read books, talk to scholars, work\n with them, play.\"\n\n\n \"You could do that and you'd\n really get to know them. But\n that takes time\u2014and we don't\n have it.\"\n\n\n \"I realize that.\"\n\n\n \"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"No. We can't help them,\" said\n Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we\n can do for them\u2014but we have to\n try.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I knew it before we\n started,\" said Bal. \"It's happened\n before. We take the trouble to\n find out what a people are like\n and when we can't help them we\n feel bad. It's going to be that\n way again.\" He rose and stretched.\n \"Well, give me an hour to\n think of some way of going at\n it.\"\nIt was longer than that before\n they met again. In the meantime\n the ship moved much closer to\n Earth. They no longer needed instruments\n to see it. The planet\n revolved outside the visionports.\n The southern plains were green,\n coursed with rivers; the oceans\n were blue; and much of the\n northern hemisphere was glistening\n white. Ragged clouds covered\n the pole, and a dirty pall\n spread over the mid-regions of\n the north.\n\n\n \"I haven't thought of anything\n brilliant,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"Nor I,\" said Bal. \"We're going\n to have to go down there\n cold. And it will be cold.\"\n\n\n \"Yes. It's their winter.\"\n\n\n \"I did have an idea,\" said Bal.\n \"What about going down as supernatural\n beings?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly,\" said Ethaniel. \"A\n hundred years ago it might have\n worked. Today they have satellites.\n They are not primitives.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose you're right,\" said\n Bal. \"I did think we ought to\n take advantage of our physical\n differences.\"\n\n\n \"If we could I'd be all for it.\n But these people are rough and\n desperate. They wouldn't be\n fooled by anything that crude.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're calling it,\" said\n Bal.\n\n\n \"All right,\" said Ethaniel.\n \"You take one side and I the\n other. We'll tell them bluntly\n what they'll have to do if they're\n going to survive, how they can\n keep their planet in one piece so\n they can live on it.\"\n\n\n \"That'll go over big. Advice is\n always popular.\"\n\n\n \"Can't help it. That's all we\n have time for.\"\n\n\n \"Special instructions?\"\n\n\n \"None. We leave the ship here\n and go down in separate landing\n craft. You can talk with me any\n time you want to through our\n communications, but don't unless\n you have to.\"\n\n\n \"They can't intercept the\n beams we use.\"\n\n\n \"They can't, and even if they\n did they wouldn't know what to\n do with our language. I want\n them to think that we don't\nneed\nto talk things over.\"\n\n\n \"I get it. Makes us seem better\n than we are. They think we know\n exactly what we're doing even\n though we don't.\"\n\n\n \"If we're lucky they'll think\n that.\"\nBal looked out of the port at\n the planet below. \"It's going to\n be cold where I'm going. You too.\n Sure we don't want to change\n our plans and land in the southern\n hemisphere? It's summer\n there.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not. The great\n powers are in the north. They\n are the ones we have to reach to\n do the job.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, but I was thinking of\n that holiday you mentioned.\n We'll be running straight into it.\n That won't help us any.\"\n\n\n \"I know, they don't like their\n holidays interrupted. It can't be\n helped. We can't wait until it's\n over.\"\n\n\n \"I'm aware of that,\" said Bal.\n \"Fill me in on that holiday, anything\n I ought to know. Probably\n religious in origin. That so?\"\n\n\n \"It was religious a long time\n ago,\" said Ethaniel. \"I didn't\n learn anything exact from radio\n and TV. Now it seems to be\n chiefly a time for eating, office\n parties, and selling merchandise.\"\n\n\n \"I see. It has become a business\n holiday.\"\n\n\n \"That's a good description. I\n didn't get as much of it as I\n ought to have. I was busy studying\n the people, and they're hard\n to pin down.\"\n\n\n \"I see. I was thinking there\n might be some way we could tie\n ourselves in with this holiday.\n Make it work for us.\"\n\n\n \"If there is I haven't thought\n of it.\"\n\n\n \"You ought to know. You're\n running this one.\" Bal looked\n down at the planet. Clouds were\n beginning to form at the twilight\n edge. \"I hate to go down\n and leave the ship up here with\n no one in it.\"\n\n\n \"They can't touch it. No matter\n how they develop in the next\n hundred years they still won't be\n able to get in or damage it in\n any way.\"\n\n\n \"It's myself I'm thinking\n about. Down there, alone.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be with you. On the other\n side of the Earth.\"\n\n\n \"That's not very close. I'd like\n it better if there were someone\n in the ship to bring it down in a\n hurry if things get rough. They\n don't think much of each other.\n I don't imagine they'll like aliens\n any better.\"\n\n\n \"They may be unfriendly,\"\n Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he\n switched a monitor screen until\n he looked at the slope of a mountain.\n It was snowing and men\n were cutting small green trees in\n the snow. \"I've thought of a\n trick.\"\n\n\n \"If it saves my neck I'm for\n it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't guarantee anything,\"\n said Ethaniel. \"This is what I\n was thinking of: instead of hiding\n the ship against the sun\n where there's little chance it will\n be seen, we'll make sure that\n they do see it. Let's take it\n around to the night side of the\n planet and light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Say, pretty good,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"They can't imagine that we'd\n light up an unmanned ship,\" said\n Ethaniel. \"Even if the thought\n should occur to them they'll have\n no way of checking it. Also, they\n won't be eager to harm us with\n our ship shining down on them.\"\n\n\n \"That's thinking,\" said Bal,\n moving to the controls. \"I'll move\n the ship over where they can see\n it best and then I'll light it up.\n I'll really light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Don't spare power.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that.\n They'll see it. Everybody on\n Earth will see it.\" Later, with the\n ship in position, glowing against\n the darkness of space, pulsating\n with light, Bal said: \"You know,\n I feel better about this. We may\n pull it off. Lighting the ship may\n be just the help we need.\"\n\n\n \"It's not we who need help, but\n the people of Earth,\" said Ethaniel.\n \"See you in five days.\" With\n that he entered a small landing\n craft, which left a faintly luminescent\n trail as it plunged toward\n Earth. As soon as it was\n safe to do so, Bal left in another\n craft, heading for the other side\n of the planet.\nAnd the spaceship circled\n Earth, unmanned, blazing and\n pulsing with light. No star in the\n winter skies of the planet below\n could equal it in brilliancy. Once\n a man-made satellite came near\n but it was dim and was lost sight\n of by the people below. During\n the day the ship was visible as\n a bright spot of light. At evening\n it seemed to burn through\n the sunset colors.\n\n\n And the ship circled on,\n bright, shining, seeming to be a\n little piece clipped from the center\n of a star and brought near\n Earth to illuminate it. Never, or\n seldom, had Earth seen anything\n like it.\n\n\n In five days the two small landing\n craft that had left it arched\n up from Earth and joined the\n orbit of the large ship. The two\n small craft slid inside the large\n one and doors closed behind\n them. In a short time the aliens\n met again.\n\n\n \"We did it,\" said Bal exultantly\n as he came in. \"I don't know\n how we did it and I thought we\n were going to fail but at the last\n minute they came through.\"\n\n\n Ethaniel smiled. \"I'm tired,\"\n he said, rustling.\n\n\n \"Me too, but mostly I'm cold,\"\n said Bal, shivering. \"Snow.\n Nothing but snow wherever I\n went. Miserable climate. And yet\n you had me go out walking after\n that first day.\"\n\n\n \"From my own experience it\n seemed to be a good idea,\" said\n Ethaniel. \"If I went out walking\n one day I noticed that the next\n day the officials were much more\n cooperative. If it worked for me\n I thought it might help you.\"\n\n\n \"It did. I don't know why, but\n it did,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, this\n agreement they made isn't the\n best but I think it will keep them\n from destroying themselves.\"\n\n\n \"It's as much as we can expect,\"\n said Ethaniel. \"They may\n have small wars after this, but\n never the big one. In fifty or a\n hundred years we can come back\n and see how much they've\n learned.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I want to,\" said\n Bal. \"Say, what's an angel?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"When I went out walking\n people stopped to look. Some\n knelt in the snow and called me\n an angel.\"\n\n\n \"Something like that happened\n to me,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"I didn't get it but I didn't let\n it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled\n at them and went about my business.\"\n He shivered again. \"It was\n always cold. I walked out, but\n sometimes I flew back. I hope\n that was all right.\"\n\n\n In the cabin Bal spread his\n great wings. Renaissance painters\n had never seen his like but\n knew exactly how he looked. In\n their paintings they had pictured\n him innumerable times.\n\n\n \"I don't think it hurt us that\n you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did\n so myself occasionally.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know what an\n angel is?\"\n\n\n \"No. I didn't have time to find\n out. Some creature of their folklore\n I suppose. You know, except\n for our wings they're very much\n like ourselves. Their legends are\n bound to resemble ours.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway,\n peace on Earth.\"\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\nJanuary\n 1960.

This unique characteristic reinforces the argument that the aliens are not only visitors from another world but also reflections of humanity's best ideals. By embodying these cherished cultural narratives, the aliens become symbols of possibility and change, suggesting that through understanding and cooperation, peace could be achieved.

It challenges the perception that differences define relationships; instead, it suggests that shared traits can become a bridge to understanding and cooperation. Furthermore, it may encourage humans to reflect on their own flaws\u2014illustrated when Ethaniel contemplates the various conflicts on Earth\u2014making the aliens' intervention seem even more urgent and relatable. In essence, the physical similarity becomes a catalyst for questioning assumptions about identity, morality, and the potential for peaceful coexistence across different forms of life.",

This is reinforced when the aliens successfully broker a peace agreement among various factions on Earth that previously would have been in conflict.

Despite the compelling arguments regarding a potential familial relationship, the narrative consistently emphasizes how Bal, with wings that evoke angelic entities, represents hope and admiration from humanity. The fact that people on Earth refer to him as an \"angel\" highlights how the aliens resonate with deeply ingrained cultural stories, suggesting their purpose extends beyond mere observation to embody archetypes that inspire change and reconciliation. The emphasis on their ethereal qualities frames the aliens within a mythological context, allowing them to fulfill a vital role in advancing humanity's understanding of itself and its potential. While acknowledging the aliens' similarities to humans, the framing of their angelic representation and its implications in the narrative strongly suggests that their significance aligns more with the mythological beings in Earth's history than with distant relatives. Therefore, the key takeaway is that their unique characteristics tie them to Earth's folklore, proving the aliens happened to look like certain beings from stories, which plays a pivotal role in their connection to humanity.",

The observation by Ethaniel that the aliens are \"very much like ourselves\" serves as a pivotal point, suggesting that their correspondence isn't merely skin deep but points to a shared evolutionary history. This connection prompts reflection upon human identity and the broader implications of what it means to be sentient beings in the universe. While my opponent emphasizes the cultural and mythological significance of the aliens' appearance, it is the notion of shared ancestry that provides the foundation for deeper understanding and empathy. Recognizing that we may have a common origin fosters a sense of kinship and enhances our appreciation of other life forms, encouraging peaceful exploration and communication. This shared ancestry not only underscores our vulnerabilities and strengths but also aligns with the broader themes of interconnectedness across the cosmos. Therefore, the notion that the aliens and humans are actually distant relatives is significant in shaping our understanding of identity, raising questions of unity and coexistence in an expansive universe.",

                "content": "In conclusion, the argument that the aliens resemble beings from Earth's myths and folklore is underscored by their significant impact on human perception and interaction. The response of humans to Bal, calling him an \"angel,\" illustrates that their appearance elicits a strong emotional and cultural resonance rather than merely a biological connection. This aspect introduces a layer of mythology that creates an environment of intrigue and acceptance, making humans more receptive to the aliens' messages. While my opponent focuses on shared ancestry, which primarily addresses biological ties, the cultural implications of the aliens' appearance foster a deeper connection that transcends these roots. The notion that the aliens embody figures from human legends allows people on Earth to engage with them in a context filled with wonder rather than fear, paving the way for potential cooperation. This connection emphasizes the relevance of myth in shaping relationships and enriching the narrative of existence itself. Therefore, the significance of the aliens presenting similarities to mythological beings speaks volumes about the nature of connections we create with others, which is critical in fostering an understanding that transcends mere ancestry.",
