Extensive\n research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on\n this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and\n typographical errors have been corrected without note.\nA Classic Reprint from AMAZING STORIES, November, 1930\nCopyright 1931, by Experimenter Publications Inc.\nThe Cosmic Express\nBy JACK WILLIAMSON\nIntroduction by Sam Moskowitz\nThe\nyear 1928 was a great\n year of discovery for\nAMAZING\n STORIES\n .\nThey were uncovering\n new talent at such a great rate,\n (Harl Vincent, David H. Keller,\n E. E. Smith, Philip Francis Nowlan,\n Fletcher Pratt and Miles J.\n Breuer), that Jack Williamson\n barely managed to become one of\n a distinguished group of discoveries\n by stealing the cover of the\n December issue for his first story\nThe Metal Man.\nA disciple of A. Merritt, he attempted\n to imitate in style, mood\n and subject the magic of that\n late lamented master of fantasy.\n The imitation found great favor\n from the readership and almost\n instantly Jack Williamson became\n an important name on the\n contents page of\nAMAZING STORIES\n .\nHe followed his initial success\n with two short novels\n, The\n Green Girl\nin\nAMAZING STORIES\nand\nThe Alien Intelligence\nin\nSCIENCE WONDER STORIES\n ,\nanother\n Gernsback publication. Both of\n these stories were close copies of\n A. Merritt, whose style and method\n Jack Williamson parlayed into\n popularity for eight years.\nYet the strange thing about it\n was that Jack Williamson was\n one of the most versatile science\n fiction authors ever to sit down\n at the typewriter. When the\n vogue for science-fantasy altered\n to super science, he created the\n memorable super lock-picker\n Giles Habilula as the major attraction\n in a rousing trio of space\n operas\n, The Legion of Space, The\n Cometeers\nand\nOne Against the\n Legion.\nWhen grim realism was\n the order of the day, he produced\nCrucible of Power\nand when they\n wanted extrapolated theory in\n present tense, he assumed the\n disguise of Will Stewart and\n popularized the concept of contra\n terrene matter in science fiction\n with\nSeetee Ship\nand\nSeetee\n Shock.\nFinally, when only psychological\n studies of the future\n would do, he produced\n\"With\n Folded Hands ...\" \"... And\n Searching Mind.\"\n\n\n The Cosmic Express\nis of special\n interest because it was written\n during Williamson's A. Merritt\n \"kick,\" when he was writing\n little else but, and it gave the\n earliest indication of a more general\n capability. The lightness of\n the handling is especially modern,\n barely avoiding the farcical\n by the validity of the notion that\n wireless transmission of matter\n is the next big transportation\n frontier to be conquered. It is\n especially important because it\n stylistically forecast a later trend\n to accept the background for\n granted, regardless of the quantity\n of wonders, and proceed with\n the story. With only a few thousand\n scanning-disk television sets\n in existence at the time of the\n writing, the surmise that this\n media would be a natural for\n westerns was particularly astute.\nJack Williamson was born in\n 1908 in the Arizona territory\n when covered wagons were the\n primary form of transportation\n and apaches still raided the settlers.\n His father was a cattle\n man, but for young Jack, the\n ranch was anything but glamorous.\n \"My days were filled,\" he remembers,\n \"with monotonous\n rounds of what seemed an endless,\n heart-breaking war with\n drought and frost and dust-storms,\n poison-weeds and hail,\n for the sake of survival on the\nLlano Estacado.\"\nThe discovery\n of\nAMAZING STORIES\nwas the escape\n he sought and his goal was\n to be a science fiction writer. He\n labored to this end and the first\n he knew that a story of his had\n been accepted was when he\n bought the December, 1929 issue\n of\nAMAZING STORIES\n .\nSince then,\n he has written millions of words\n of science fiction and has gone on\n record as follows: \"I feel that\n science-fiction is the folklore of\n the new world of science, and\n the expression of man's reaction\n to a technological environment.\n By which I mean that it is the\n most interesting and stimulating\n form of literature today.\"\nMr. Eric Stokes-Harding\n tumbled out of the\n rumpled bed-clothing, a striking\n slender figure in purple-striped\n pajamas. He smiled fondly across\n to the other of the twin beds,\n where Nada, his pretty bride,\n lay quiet beneath light silk covers.\n With a groan, he stood up\n and began a series of fantastic\n bending exercises. But after a\n few half-hearted movements, he\n gave it up, and walked through\n an open door into a small bright\n room, its walls covered with bookcases\n and also with scientific appliances\n that would have been\n strange to the man of four or\n five centuries before, when the\n Age of Aviation was beginning.\nSuddenly there was a sharp tingling\n sensation where they touched\n the polished surface.\nYawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\n stood before the great\n open window, staring out. Below\n him was a wide, park-like space,\n green with emerald lawns, and\n bright with flowering plants.\n Two hundred yards across it rose\n an immense pyramidal building\u2014an\n artistic structure, gleaming\n with white marble and bright\n metal, striped with the verdure\n of terraced roof-gardens,\n its slender peak rising to\n help support the gray, steel-ribbed\n glass roof above. Beyond,\n the park stretched away in\n illimitable vistas, broken with\n the graceful columned buildings\n that held up the great glass roof.\n\n\n Above the glass, over this New\n York of 2432 A. D., a freezing\n blizzard was sweeping. But small\n concern was that to the lightly\n clad man at the window, who was\n inhaling deeply the fragrant air\n from the plants below\u2014air kept,\n winter and summer, exactly at\n 20\u00b0 C.\n\n\n With another yawn, Mr. Eric\n Stokes-Harding turned back to\n the room, which was bright with\n the rich golden light that poured\n in from the suspended globes of\n the cold ato-light that illuminated\n the snow-covered city.\n With a distasteful grimace, he\n seated himself before a broad,\n paper-littered desk, sat a few\n minutes leaning back, with his\n hands clasped behind his head.\n At last he straightened reluctantly,\n slid a small typewriter\n out of its drawer, and began\n pecking at it impatiently.\n\n\n For Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\n was an author. There was a whole\n shelf of his books on the wall, in\n bright jackets, red and blue and\n green, that brought a thrill of\n pleasure to the young novelist's\n heart when he looked up from his\n clattering machine.\n\n\n He wrote \"thrilling action romances,\"\n as his enthusiastic publishers\n and television directors\n said, \"of ages past, when men\n were men. Red-blooded heroes responding\n vigorously to the stirring\n passions of primordial life!\"\nHe\n was impartial as to the\n source of his thrills\u2014provided\n they were distant enough\n from modern civilization. His\n hero was likely to be an ape-man\n roaring through the jungle, with\n a bloody rock in one hand and\n a beautiful girl in the other.\n Or a cowboy, \"hard-riding, hard-shooting,\"\n the vanishing hero of\n the ancient ranches. Or a man\n marooned with a lovely woman\n on a desert South Sea island.\n His heroes were invariably\n strong, fearless, resourceful fellows,\n who could handle a club on\n equal terms with a cave-man, or\n call science to aid them in defending\n a beautiful mate from\n the terrors of a desolate wilderness.\n\n\n And a hundred million read\n Eric's novels, and watched the\n dramatization of them on the\n television screens. They thrilled\n at the simple, romantic lives his\n heroes led, paid him handsome\n royalties, and subconsciously\n shared his opinion that civilization\n had taken all the best from\n the life of man.\n\n\n Eric had settled down to the\n artistic satisfaction of describing\n the sensuous delight of his\n hero in the roasted marrow-bones\n of a dead mammoth, when\n the pretty woman in the other\n room stirred, and presently came\n tripping into the study, gay and\n vivacious, and\u2014as her husband\n of a few months most justly\n thought\u2014altogether beautiful in\n a bright silk dressing gown.\n\n\n Recklessly, he slammed the\n machine back into its place, and\n resolved to forget that his next\n \"red-blooded action thriller\" was\n due in the publisher's office at the\n end of the month. He sprang up\n to kiss his wife, held her embraced\n for a long happy moment.\n And then they went hand in\n hand, to the side of the room and\n punched a series of buttons on a\n panel\u2014a simple way of ordering\n breakfast sent up the automatic\n shaft from the kitchens below.\n\n\n Nada Stokes-Harding was also\n an author. She wrote poems\u2014\"back\n to nature stuff\"\u2014simple\n lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of\n bird songs, of bright flowers and\n warm winds, of thrilling communion\n with Nature, and growing\n things. Men read her poems\n and called her a genius. Even\n though the whole world had\n grown up into a city, the birds\n were extinct, there were no wild\n flowers, and no one had time to\n bother about sunsets.\n\n\n \"Eric, darling,\" she said, \"isn't\n it terrible to be cooped up here\n in this little flat, away from the\n things we both love?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, dear. Civilization has\n ruined the world. If we could only\n have lived a thousand years ago,\n when life was simple and natural,\n when men hunted and killed their\n meat, instead of drinking synthetic\n stuff, when men still had\n the joys of conflict, instead of\n living under glass, like hot-house\n flowers.\"\n\n\n \"If we could only go somewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There isn't anywhere to go. I\n write about the West, Africa,\n South Sea Islands. But they\n were all filled up two hundred\n years ago. Pleasure resorts, sanatoriums,\n cities, factories.\"\n\n\n \"If only we lived on Venus!\n I was listening to a lecture on\n the television, last night. The\n speaker said that the Planet\n Venus is younger than the Earth,\n that it has not cooled so much. It\n has a thick, cloudy atmosphere,\n and low, rainy forests. There's\n simple, elemental life there\u2014like\n Earth had before civilization\n ruined it.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red\n ray telescope, that penetrates\n the cloud layers of the\n planet, proved that Venus rotates\n in about the same period as\n Earth; and it must be much like\n Earth was a million years ago.\"\n\n\n \"Eric, I wonder if we could go\n there! It would be so thrilling to\n begin life like the characters in\n your stories, to get away from\n this hateful civilization, and live\n natural lives. Maybe a rocket\u2014\"\nThe\n young author's eyes were\n glowing. He skipped across the\n floor, seized Nada, kissed her\n ecstatically. \"Splendid! Think of\n hunting in the virgin forest, and\n bringing the game home to you!\n But I'm afraid there is no way.\u2014Wait!\n The Cosmic Express.\"\n\n\n \"The Cosmic Express?\"\n\n\n \"A new invention. Just perfected\n a few weeks ago, I understand.\n By Ludwig Von der Valls,\n the German physicist.\"\n\n\n \"I've quit bothering about science.\n It has ruined nature, filled\n the world with silly, artificial\n people, doing silly, artificial\n things.\"\n\n\n \"But this is quite remarkable,\n dear. A new way to travel\u2014by\n ether!\"\n\n\n \"By ether!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. You know of course that\n energy and matter are interchangeable\n terms; both are simply\n etheric vibration, of different\n sorts.\"\n\n\n \"Of course. That's elementary.\"\n She smiled proudly. \"I can\n give you examples, even of the\n change. The disintegration of the\n radium atom, making helium\n and lead and\nenergy\n. And Millikan's\n old proof that his Cosmic\n Ray is generated when particles\n of electricity are united to form\n an atom.\"\n\n\n \"Fine! I thought you said you\n weren't a scientist.\" He glowed\n with pride. \"But the method, in\n the new Cosmic Express, is simply\n to convert the matter to be\n carried into power, send it out\n as a radiant beam and focus the\n beam to convert it back into\n atoms at the destination.\"\n\n\n \"But the amount of energy\n must be terrific\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It is. You know short waves\n carry more energy than long\n ones. The Express Ray is an\n electromagnetic vibration of frequency\n far higher than that of\n even the Cosmic Ray, and correspondingly\n more powerful and\n more penetrating.\"\n\n\n The girl frowned, running slim\n fingers through golden-brown\n hair. \"But I don't see how they\n get any recognizable object, not\n even how they get the radiation\n turned back into matter.\"\n\n\n \"The beam is focused, just like\n the light that passes through a\n camera lens. The photographic\n lens, using light rays, picks up a\n picture and reproduces it again\n on the plate\u2014just the same as\n the Express Ray picks up an\n object and sets it down on the\n other side of the world.\n\n\n \"An analogy from television\n might help. You know that by\n means of the scanning disc, the\n picture is transformed into mere\n rapid fluctuations in the brightness\n of a beam of light. In a\n parallel manner, the focal plane\n of the Express Ray moves slowly\n through the object, progressively,\n dissolving layers of the\n thickness of a single atom, which\n are accurately reproduced at the\n other focus of the instrument\u2014which\n might be in Venus!\n\n\n \"But the analogy of the lens\n is the better of the two. For no\n receiving instrument is required,\n as in television. The object is\n built up of an infinite series of\n plane layers, at the focus of the\n ray, no matter where that may\n be. Such a thing would be impossible\n with radio apparatus\n because even with the best beam\n transmission, all but a tiny fraction\n of the power is lost, and\n power is required to rebuild the\n atoms. Do you understand,\n dear?\"\n\n\n \"Not altogether. But I should\n worry! Here comes breakfast.\n Let me butter your toast.\"\n\n\n A bell had rung at the shaft.\n She ran to it, and returned with\n a great silver tray, laden with\n dainty dishes, which she set on a\n little side table. They sat down\n opposite each other, and ate, getting\n as much satisfaction from\n contemplation of each other's\n faces as from the excellent food.\n When they had finished, she carried\n the tray to the shaft, slid\n it in a slot, and touched a button\u2014thus\n disposing of the culinary\n cares of the morning.\n\n\n She ran back to Eric, who was\n once more staring distastefully\n at his typewriter.\n\n\n \"Oh, darling! I'm thrilled to\n death about the Cosmic Express!\n If we could go to Venus, to a new\n life on a new world, and get\n away from all this hateful conventional\n society\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We can go to their office\u2014it's\n only five minutes. The chap\n that operates the machine for\n the company is a pal of mine.\n He's not supposed to take passengers\n except between the offices\n they have scattered about the\n world. But I know his weak\n point\u2014\"\n\n\n Eric laughed, fumbled with a\n hidden spring under his desk. A\n small polished object, gleaming\n silvery, slid down into his hand.\n\n\n \"Old friendship,\nplus\nthis,\n would make him\u2014like spinach.\"\nFive\n minutes later Mr. Eric\n Stokes-Harding and his pretty\n wife were in street clothes,\n light silk tunics of loose, flowing\n lines\u2014little clothing being required\n in the artificially warmed\n city. They entered an elevator\n and dropped thirty stories to the\n ground floor of the great building.\n\n\n There they entered a cylindrical\n car, with rows of seats down\n the sides. Not greatly different\n from an ancient subway car, except\n that it was air-tight, and\n was hurled by magnetic attraction\n and repulsion through a\n tube exhausted of air, at a speed\n that would have made an old\n subway rider gasp with amazement.\n\n\n In five more minutes their car\n had whipped up to the base of\n another building, in the business\n section, where there was no room\n for parks between the mighty\n structures that held the unbroken\n glass roofs two hundred stories\n above the concrete pavement.\n\n\n An elevator brought them up a\n hundred and fifty stories. Eric\n led Nada down a long, carpeted\n corridor to a wide glass door,\n which bore the words:\nCOSMIC EXPRESS\nstenciled in gold capitals across\n it.\n\n\n As they approached, a lean\n man, carrying a black bag, darted\n out of an elevator shaft opposite\n the door, ran across the corridor,\n and entered. They pushed in after\n him.\n\n\n They were in a little room,\n cut in two by a high brass grill.\n In front of it was a long bench\n against the wall, that reminded\n one of the waiting room in an old\n railroad depot. In the grill was a\n little window, with a lazy, brown-eyed\n youth leaning on the shelf\n behind it. Beyond him was a\n great, glittering piece of mechanism,\n half hidden by the brass.\n A little door gave access to the\n machine from the space before\n the grill.\n\n\n The thin man in black, whom\n Eric now recognized as a prominent\n French heart-specialist, was\n dancing before the window, waving\n his bag frantically, raving at\n the sleepy boy.\n\n\n \"Queek! I have tell you zee\n truth! I have zee most urgent\n necessity to go queekly. A patient\n I have in Paree, zat ees in\n zee most creetical condition!\"\n\n\n \"Hold your horses just a minute,\n Mister. We got a client in\n the machine now. Russian diplomat\n from Moscow to Rio de\n Janeiro.... Two hundred seventy\n dollars and eighty cents,\n please.... Your turn next. Remember\n this is just an experimental\n service. Regular installations\n all over the world in a year....\n Ready now. Come on in.\"\n\n\n The youth took the money,\n pressed a button. The door\n sprang open in the grill, and the\n frantic physician leaped through\n it.\n\n\n \"Lie down on the crystal, face\n up,\" the young man ordered.\n \"Hands at your sides, don't\n breathe. Ready!\"\n\n\n He manipulated his dials and\n switches, and pressed another\n button.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Eric, old man!\"\n he cried. \"That's the lady you\n were telling me about? Congratulations!\"\n A bell jangled before\n him on the panel. \"Just a minute.\n I've got a call.\"\n\n\n He punched the board again.\n Little bulbs lit and glowed for a\n second. The youth turned toward\n the half-hidden machine, spoke\n courteously.\n\n\n \"All right, madam. Walk out.\n Hope you found the transit pleasant.\"\n\n\n \"But my Violet! My precious\n Violet!\" a shrill female voice\n came from the machine. \"Sir,\n what have you done with my\n darling Violet?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know, madam.\n You lost it off your hat?\"\n\n\n \"None of your impertinence,\n sir! I want my dog.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a dog. Must have jumped\n off the crystal. You can have\n him sent on for three hundred\n and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Young man, if any harm\n comes to my Violet\u2014I'll\u2014I'll\u2014I'll\n appeal to the Society for the\n Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!\"\n\n\n \"Very good, madam. We appreciate\n your patronage.\"\nThe\n door flew open again.\n A very fat woman, puffing\n angrily, face highly colored,\n clothing shimmering with artificial\n gems, waddled pompously\n out of the door through which\n the frantic French doctor had\n so recently vanished. She rolled\n heavily across the room, and out\n into the corridor. Shrill words\n floated back:\n\n\n \"I'm going to see my lawyer!\n My precious Violet\u2014\"\n\n\n The sallow youth winked.\n \"And now what can I do for you,\n Eric?\"\n\n\n \"We want to go to Venus, if\n that ray of yours can put us\n there.\"\n\n\n \"To Venus? Impossible. My\n orders are to use the Express\n merely between the sixteen designated\n stations, at New York,\n San Francisco, Tokyo, London,\n Paris\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Charley,\" with a\n cautious glance toward the door,\n Eric held up the silver flask.\n \"For old time's sake, and for\n this\u2014\"\n\n\n The boy seemed dazed at sight\n of the bright flask. Then, with a\n single swift motion, he snatched\n it out of Eric's hand, and bent\n to conceal it below his instrument\n panel.\n\n\n \"Sure, old boy. I'd send you to\n heaven for that, if you'd give me\n the micrometer readings to set\n the ray with. But I tell you, this\n is dangerous. I've got a sort of\n television attachment, for focusing\n the ray. I can turn that on\n Venus\u2014I've been amusing myself,\n watching the life there, already.\n Terrible place. Savage. I\n can pick a place on high land to\n set you down. But I can't be responsible\n for what happens afterward.\"\n\n\n \"Simple, primitive life is what\n we're looking for. And now what\n do I owe you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's all right. Between\n friends. Provided that stuff's\n genuine! Walk in and lie down on\n the crystal block. Hands at your\n sides. Don't move.\"\n\n\n The little door had swung\n open again, and Eric led Nada\n through. They stepped into a little\n cell, completely surrounded\n with mirrors and vast prisms\n and lenses and electron tubes. In\n the center was a slab of transparent\n crystal, eight feet square\n and two inches thick, with an\n intricate mass of machinery below\n it.\n\n\n Eric helped Nada to a place\n on the crystal, lay down at her\n side.\n\n\n \"I think the Express Ray is\n focused just at the surface of the\n crystal, from below,\" he said. \"It\n dissolves our substance, to be\n transmitted by the beam. It\n would look as if we were melting\n into the crystal.\"\n\n\n \"Ready,\" called the youth.\n \"Think I've got it for you. Sort\n of a high island in the jungle.\n Nothing bad in sight now. But,\n I say\u2014how're you coming back?\n I haven't got time to watch you.\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead. We aren't coming\n back.\"\n\n\n \"Gee! What is it? Elopement?\n I thought you were married already.\n Or is it business difficulties?\n The Bears did make an awful\n raid last night. But you better\n let me set you down in Hong\n Kong.\"\n\n\n A bell jangled. \"So long,\" the\n youth called.\n\n\n Nada and Eric felt themselves\n enveloped in fire. Sheets of white\n flame seemed to lap up about\n them from the crystal block. Suddenly\n there was a sharp tingling\n sensation where they touched\n the polished surface. Then blackness,\n blankness.\nThe\n next thing they knew, the\n fires were gone from about\n them. They were lying in something\n extremely soft and fluid;\n and warm rain was beating in\n their faces. Eric sat up, found\n himself in a mud-puddle. Beside\n him was Nada, opening her eyes\n and struggling up, her bright\n garments stained with black\n mud.\n\n\n All about rose a thick jungle,\n dark and gloomy\u2014and very wet.\n Palm-like, the gigantic trees\n were, or fern-like, flinging clouds\n of feathery green foliage high\n against a somber sky of unbroken\n gloom.\n\n\n They stood up, triumphant.\n\n\n \"At last!\" Nada cried. \"We're\n free! Free of that hateful old\n civilization! We're back to Nature!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, we're on our feet now,\n not parasites on the machines.\"\n\n\n \"It's wonderful to have a fine,\n strong man like you to trust in,\n Eric. You're just like one of the\n heroes in your books!\"\n\n\n \"You're the perfect companion,\n Nada.... But now we\n must be practical. We must\n build a fire, find weapons, set up\n a shelter of some kind. I guess it\n will be night, pretty soon. And\n Charley said something about\n savage animals he had seen in\n the television.\n\n\n \"We'll find a nice dry cave,\n and have a fire in front of the\n door. And skins of animals to\n sleep on. And pottery vessels to\n cook in. And you will find seeds\n and grown grain.\"\n\n\n \"But first we must find a flint-bed.\n We need flint for tools, and\n to strike sparks to make a fire\n with. We will probably come\n across a chunk of virgin copper,\n too\u2014it's found native.\"\n\n\n Presently they set off through\n the jungle. The mud seemed to\n be very abundant, and of a most\n sticky consistence. They sank\n into it ankle deep at every step,\n and vast masses of it clung to\n their feet. A mile they struggled\n on, without finding where a provident\n nature had left them even\n a single fragment of quartz, to\n say nothing of a mass of pure\n copper.\n\n\n \"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled,\n \"to come forty million\n miles, and meet such a reception\n as this!\"\n\n\n Nada stopped. \"Eric,\" she\n said, \"I'm tired. And I don't believe\n there's any rock here, anyway.\n You'll have to use wooden\n tools, sharpened in the fire.\"\n\n\n \"Probably you're right. This\n soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.\n Shouldn't be surprised if\n the native rock is some hundreds\n of feet underground. Your\n idea is better.\"\n\n\n \"You can make a fire by rubbing\n sticks together, can't you?\"\n\n\n \"It can be done, I'm sure. I've\n never tried it, myself. We need\n some dry sticks, first.\"\n\n\n They resumed the weary\n march, with a good fraction of\n the new planet adhering to their\n feet. Rain was still falling from\n the dark heavens in a steady,\n warm downpour. Dry wood\n seemed scarce as the proverbial\n hen's teeth.\n\n\n \"You didn't bring any matches,\n dear?\"\n\n\n \"Matches! Of course not!\n We're going back to Nature.\"\n\n\n \"I hope we get a fire pretty\n soon.\"\n\n\n \"If dry wood were gold dust,\n we couldn't buy a hot dog.\"\n\n\n \"Eric, that reminds me that\n I'm hungry.\"\n\n\n He confessed to a few pangs of\n his own. They turned their attention\n to looking for banana\n trees, and coconut palms, but\n they did not seem to abound in\n the Venerian jungle. Even small\n animals that might have been\n slain with a broken branch had\n contrary ideas about the matter.\n\n\n At last, from sheer weariness,\n they stopped, and gathered\n branches to make a sloping shelter\n by a vast fallen tree-trunk.\n\n\n \"This will keep out the rain\u2014maybe\u2014\"\n Eric said hopefully.\n \"And tomorrow, when it has quit\n raining\u2014I'm sure we'll do better.\"\n\n\n They crept in, as gloomy night\n fell without. They lay in each\n other's arms, the body warmth\n oddly comforting. Nada cried a\n little.\n\n\n \"Buck up,\" Eric advised her.\n \"We're back to nature\u2014where\n we've always wanted to be.\"\nWith\n the darkness, the temperature\n fell somewhat, and\n a high wind rose, whipping cold\n rain into the little shelter, and\n threatening to demolish it.\n Swarms of mosquito-like insects,\n seemingly not inconvenienced in\n the least by the inclement elements,\n swarmed about them in\n clouds.\n\n\n Then came a sound from the\n dismal stormy night, a hoarse,\n bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.\n\n\n Nada clung against Eric.\n \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.\n\n\n \"Must be a reptile. Dinosaur,\n or something of the sort. This\n world seems to be in about the\n same state as the Earth when\n they flourished there.... But\n maybe it won't find us.\"\n\n\n The roar was repeated, nearer.\n The earth trembled beneath a\n mighty tread.\n\n\n \"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled.\n \"Don't you think\u2014it might have\n been better\u2014 You know the old\n life was not so bad, after all.\"\n\n\n \"I was just thinking of our\n rooms, nice and warm and\n bright, with hot foods coming up\n the shaft whenever we pushed\n the button, and the gay crowds\n in the park, and my old typewriter.\"\n\n\n \"Eric?\" she called softly.\n\n\n \"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\n \"Don't you wish\u2014we had\n known better?\"\n\n\n \"I do.\" If he winced at the\n \"we\" the girl did not notice.\n\n\n The roaring outside was closer.\n And suddenly it was answered\n by another raucous bellow, at\n considerable distance, that echoed\n strangely through the forest.\n The fearful sounds were repeated,\n alternately. And always\n the more distant seemed nearer,\n until the two sounds were together.\n\n\n And then an infernal din\n broke out in the darkness. Bellows.\n Screams. Deafening\n shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if\n struggling Titans had upset\n oceans. Thunderous crashes, as\n if they were demolishing forests.\n\n\n Eric and Nada clung to each\n other, in doubt whether to stay\n or to fly through the storm.\n Gradually the sound of the conflict\n came nearer, until the earth\n shook beneath them, and they\n were afraid to move.\n\n\n Suddenly the great fallen tree\n against which they had erected\n the flimsy shelter was rolled\n back, evidently by a chance blow\n from the invisible monsters. The\n pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled\n humans. Nada burst\n into tears.\n\n\n \"Oh, if only\u2014if only\u2014\"\nSuddenly\n flame lapped up\n about them, the same white\n fire they had seen as they lay on\n the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility\n overcame them. A few\n moments later, they were lying\n on the transparent table in the\n Cosmic Express office, with all\n those great mirrors and prisms\n and lenses about them.\n\n\n A bustling, red-faced official\n appeared through the door in the\n grill, fairly bubbling apologies.\n\n\n \"So sorry\u2014an accident\u2014inconceivable.\n I can't see how he\n got it! We got you back as soon\n as we could find a focus. I sincerely\n hope you haven't been injured.\"\n\n\n \"Why\u2014what\u2014what\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Why I happened in, found\n our operator drunk. I've no idea\n where he got the stuff. He muttered\n something about Venus. I\n consulted the auto-register, and\n found two more passengers registered\n here than had been recorded\n at our other stations. I\n looked up the duplicate beam coordinates,\n and found that it had\n been set on Venus. I got men on\n the television at once, and we\n happened to find you.\n\n\n \"I can't imagine how it happened.\n I've had the fellow locked\n up, and the 'dry-laws' are on the\n job. I hope you won't hold us for\n excessive damages.\"\n\n\n \"No, I ask nothing except that\n you don't press charges against\n the boy. I don't want him to suffer\n for it in any way.

Specifically, the phrase, \u201cthe method, in the new Cosmic Express, is simply to convert the matter to be carried into power, send it out as a radiant beam and focus the beam to convert it back into atoms at the destination,\u201d captures the operational mechanics effectively. \n\nMy opponent has presented strong arguments, but it is important to emphasize that the description provided outlines a clear sequential flow of events: the matter is first transformed into energy, transmitted as a focused beam, and only then reconstructed at the destination. This sequence is critical as it ensures the structural integrity of the matter being transported is maintained, reinforcing the reliability and functionality of the Cosmic Express Ray. Thus, upon considering both sides of the debate and the key details presented in the article, I firmly advocate that my defined answer accurately reflects the mechanism of the Cosmic Express Ray.",

The article states, \u201cthe method, in the new Cosmic Express, is simply to convert the matter to be carried into power, send it out as a radiant beam and focus the beam to convert it back into atoms at the destination,\u201d illustrating the important steps involved.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that my opponent's scenario has merit, yet the focus on the radiant beam as the central mechanism highlights its significance in converting and transmitting matter accurately. The comparison to photographic techniques serves to reinforce how the focused nature of the beam ensures the integrity of the original matter, with each atom being precisely reassembled once it arrives at its destination. Thus, the answer I defend encapsulates not only the process of conversion and transmission but underscores the fundamental reliance on the radiant beam, arguing for its primacy in this innovative transport mechanism.",
