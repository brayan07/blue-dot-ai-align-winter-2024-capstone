SMITH\n\n\n Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction May 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe girl was tall, wide-eyed and brunette. She had the right curves in\n the right places and would have been beautiful if her nose had been\n smaller, if her mouth had been larger and if her hair had been wavy\n instead of straight.\n\n\n \"Hank said you wanted to see me,\" she said when she stopped beside\n Joe's table.\n\n\n \"Yeah.\" Joe nodded at the other chair. \"Have a seat.\" He reached into a\n pocket, withdrew five ten-dollar bills and handed them to her. \"I want\n you to do a job for me. It'll only take a few minutes.\"\n\n\n The girl counted the money, then placed it in her purse. Joe noticed\n a small counterfeit-detector inside the purse before she closed it.\n \"What's the job?\"\n\n\n \"Tell you later.\" He gulped the remainder of his drink, almost pouring\n it down his throat.\n\n\n \"Hey. You trying to make yourself sick?\"\n\n\n \"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to get drunk all afternoon.\" As the\n liquor settled in his stomach, he waited for the warm glow. But the\n glow didn't come ... the bartender had watered his drink again.\n\n\n \"Trying to get drunk?\" the girl inquired. \"Are you crazy?\"\n\n\n \"No. It's simple. If I get drunk, I can join the AAA and get free room\n and board for a month while they give me a treatment.\"\n\n\n It was easy enough to understand, he reflected, but a lot harder to do.\n The CPA robot bartenders saw to it that anyone got high if they wanted,\n but comparatively few got drunk. Each bartender could not only mix\n drinks but could also judge by a man's actions and speech when he was\n on the verge of drunkenness. At the proper time\u2014since drunkenness was\n illegal\u2014a bartender always watered the drinks.\n\n\n Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but\n had always failed. And in all of New York's millions, there had been\n only a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year.\n\n\n The girl laughed. \"If you're that hard up, I don't know if I should\n take this fifty or not. Why don't you go out and get a job like\n everyone else?\"\n\n\n As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she\n saw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal\n Tendencies.\nWhen she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to\n pieces. He'd done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to\n get another\u2014everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and\n show it upon request.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I didn't know you were a DCT.\"\n\n\n \"And who'll hire a guy with criminal tendencies? You know the score.\n When you try to get a job, they ask to see your ID before they even\n tell you if there's an opening or not. If your CPA ID says you're a\n DCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've had\n several jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man,\n street-cleaner, ditch-digger\u2014\"\n\n\n On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and\n a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.\n\n\n Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned\n across the table and whispered in the girl's ear, \"That's what I\n want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get\n convicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!\"\n\n\n The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. \"Say! You really got big\n plans, don't you?\"\n\n\n He smiled at her admiration. It\nwas\nsomething big to plan a crime.\n A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting,\n blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA\u2014Crime\n Prevention Association. There were no longer any prisons\u2014CPA officials\n had declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent\n crime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of\n ingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime\n almost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men\n in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.\n\n\n No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill\n someone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he\n wasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all\n criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock\n treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and\n a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few\n criminals\u2014only ten in New York during the past year\u2014any city could\n afford the CPA hospitals.\n\n\n The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because\n it did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with\n prisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.\n\n\n And, ironically, a man who\ndid\ncommit a crime was a sort of hero. He\n was a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses\n to kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a\n hero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was\u2014when he left one of the\n CPA hospitals\u2014a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a\n man who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money.\n And therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatment\n was commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the\n word an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.\n\n\n \"Well,\" the girl said. \"I'm honored. Really. But I got a date at ten.\n Let's get it over with. You said it'd only take a few minutes.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Let's go.\"\nThe girl followed him across the room, around tables, through a door,\n down a hall, through a back door and into the alley.\n\n\n She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped\n her blouse and skirt.\n\n\n He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away,\n her body poised like a wrestler's. \"What's the big idea?\"\n\n\n \"Scream,\" Joe said. \"Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get\n here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\"\n\n\n The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the\n few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime\n because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the\n intended victim\u2014and because millions of women voters had voted it a\n crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc.,\n were not crimes. They weren't crimes because the DCT didn't complete\n the act, and if he didn't complete the act, that meant simply that the\n CPA had once again functioned properly.\n\n\n The girl shook her head vigorously. \"Sorry, buddy. Can't help you that\n way. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter?\" Joe complained. \"I'm not asking you to do anything\n wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You stupid jerk. What do you think this is\u2014the Middle Ages? Don't you\n know almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant in\n the WSDA!\"\n\n\n Joe groaned. The WSDA\u2014Women's Self-Defense Association\u2014a branch of\n the CPA. The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even\n developed new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in\n those new techniques.\n\n\n The girl was still shaking her head. \"Can't do it, buddy. I'd lose my\n rank if you were convicted of\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Do I have to\nmake\nyou scream?\" Joe inquired tiredly and advanced\n toward the girl.\n\n\n \"\u2014and that rank carries a lot of weight. Hey!\nStop it!\n\"\n\n\n Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when\n she said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body,\n and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.\nThe alley's concrete floor was hard\u2014it had always been hard, but he\n became acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it.\n There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful\n stars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police\n sirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closed\n in on him.\nWhen he awoke, a rough voice was saying, \"Okay. Snap out of it.\"\n\n\n He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner's office. It\n would be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture\n except for a desk and chairs, but the walls were lined with the\n controls of television screens, electronic calculators and a hundred\n other machines that formed New York's mechanical police force.\n\n\n Commissioner Hendricks was a remarkable character. There was something\n wrong with his glands, and he was a huge, greasy bulk of a man with\n bushy eyebrows and a double chin. His steel-gray eyes showed something\n of his intelligence and he would have gone far in politics if fate\n hadn't made him so ugly, for more than half the voters who elected men\n to high political positions were women.\n\n\n Anyone who knew Hendricks well liked him, for he was a friendly,\n likable person. But the millions of women voters who saw his face on\n posters and on their TV screens saw only the ugly face and heard only\n the harsh voice. The President of the United States was a capable\n man, but also a very handsome one, and the fact that a man who looked\n something like a bulldog had been elected as New York's police\n commissioner was a credit to Hendricks and millions of women voters.\n\n\n \"Where's the girl?\" Joe asked.\n\n\n \"I processed her while you were out cold. She left. Joe, you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"I'll save you the trouble. I admit it. Attempted\n rape. I confess.\"\n\n\n Hendricks smiled. \"Sorry, Joe. You missed the boat again.\" He reached\n out and turned a dial on his desk top. \"We had a microphone hidden in\n that alley. We have a lot of microphones hidden in a lot of alleys.\n You'd be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in\n alleys!\"\n\n\n Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of\n machines on the walls, \"\nScream. Scream as loud as you can, and when\n the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.\n\" And then the girl's\n voice, \"\nSorry, buddy. Can't help\u2014\n\"\n\n\n He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\"\nHendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was\n slouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\"\n\n\n Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world\n had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime.\n Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from\n committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly\n once again. That meant the CPA had once again\nprevented\ncrime, and\n the CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt\n to prevent crimes\nby\npunishment. If it did, that would be a violation\n of the New Civil Rights.\n\n\n Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a\n button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.\n\n\n When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words\n DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before.\n And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a\n DCT First Class.\n\n\n \"You've graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do\n you? Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know\n what that means?\"\n\n\n Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face.\n \"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers.\n You'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it\n works? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night\n and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe\n Harper.' So they look up your record\u2014amateur cops always keep records\n of First Classes in scrapbooks\u2014and they see that you stop frequently\n at Walt's Tavern.\n\n\n \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not\n to let you know they're watching you. They watch you all night, just\n hoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone,\n so they can be the first ones to yell '\nPolice!\n' They'll watch you\n because it's exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever\ndid\nprevent you from committing a crime, they'd get a nice reward and\n they'd be famous.\"\n\n\n \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl\u2014\"\n\n\n Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is\n interesting. You see, it doesn't stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's\n thousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from\n reading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because\n it's rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down\n the street, there'll be at least a dozen of 'em following you, and no\n matter where you go, you can bet there'll be some of 'em sitting next\n to you, standing next to you.\n\n\n \"During the day, they'll take your picture with their spy cameras that\n look like buttons on their coats. At night, they'll peep at you through\n your keyhole. Your neighbors across the street will watch you through\n binoculars and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lay off!\"\nJoe squirmed in the chair. He'd been lectured by Hendricks before and\n it was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talking\n machine once he got started, a machine that couldn't be stopped.\n\n\n \"And the kids are the worst,\" Hendricks continued. \"They have Junior\n CPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard\n boxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you through\n restaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you in\n public rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes\n while they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look\n back, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a\n block behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until the\n day you die, because you're a freak!\"\n\n\n Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced\n the floor.\n\n\n \"And it doesn't end\nthere\n, Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be the\n object of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop\n you on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'll\n ask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were\n a child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First\n Class?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop\n you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Okay, goddam it!\nStop it!\n\"\n\n\n Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief\n and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're too\n dumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime and\n criminals ... to\nhate\nthem as nothing has ever been hated before.\n Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell\n if you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town where\n there aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or\u2014\"\n\n\n Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \"\nFavor\n, did you say? The day you\n do\nme\na favor\u2014\"\n\n\n Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I\n want to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read\n books. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\"\n\n\n \"I couldn't leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I'm flat broke. Thanks to\n your CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.\"\nHendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extended\n them. \"I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back a\n little at a time.\"\n\n\n Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Why\n don't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me\u2014any\n crime.\"\n\n\n \"Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is a\n violation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\"\n\n\n \"Umm.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't\nhave\nto\n be a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your\n criminal tendencies and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Go to those\nhead-shrinkers\n?\"\n\n\n Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\"\n\n\n Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you\nmake\nme go?\"\n\n\n \"Violation of Civil Rights.\"\n\n\n \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same\n thing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\"\n\n\n \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks\n walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.\n \"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New\n York who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people who\n aren't protected properly\u2014blind spots in our protection devices. As\n soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices,\n but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.\n\n\n \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can\n I do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe,\n pick a name and go out and rob him.'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did\n that, I'd be committing a crime myself!\"\n\n\n He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket\n again and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of\n thirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.\"\n\n\n Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the\n big man. Hendricks was\u2014unbelievably\u2014offering him a victim, offering\n him a crime!\n\n\n Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and\n address and memorized it:\nJohn Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St.\nWhen Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.\"\nWhen Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a\n child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid\n of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill\n at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his\n own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the\n feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for\n him to make a mistake.\n\n\n Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.\n Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns,\n alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited\n for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked\n up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.\n\n\n If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they\n were discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received,\n the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene\n in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden\n microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages\n to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in\n someone's pocket at forty yards.\n\n\n Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery\n store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place\n of business for years.\n\n\n Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors\u2014devices\n placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of\n heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had\n made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing\n poison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount\n of it would kill a human.\n\n\n The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the\n supervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think\n of kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was\n pointless. A counterfeiter's career was always short-lived: every place\n of business and millions of individuals had small counterfeit-detectors\n that could spot a fake and report it directly to the Brain.\n\n\n And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance\n of the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled\n that he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were\n different: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and\n their aim was infallible.\nIt was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn't\n fantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered across\n the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously\n low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power\n required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of\n four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of\n the devices had cost even less.\n\n\n And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at\n the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked\n subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio\n or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he\n invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.\n If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters\n declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he\n always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit\n anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.\n\n\n It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and\n heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his\n subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime\n was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.\n\n\n Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands\n of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment\n 204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.\n\n\n The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204,\n he could see that the wall on either side of it was\nnew\n. That is,\n instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls\n were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and\n the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating\n another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by\n law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but\n evidently he didn't want to pay for installation.\n\n\n When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to\n close the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the\n bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at\n night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.\n\n\n Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the\n crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.\nHe broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old\n magazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a\n crime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of\n being respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.\n\n\n He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear.\n The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run,\n but\u2014perfection itself\u2014engraved on the back was the inscription,\nTo\n John with Love\n. His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy\n for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.\n\n\n Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \"\nThief! Police!\n Help!\n\"\n\n\n He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a\n police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him;\n cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.\n\n\n When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the\n metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who\n reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.\nHe was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, \"Hey. Wake up. Hey!\"\n\n\n He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minute\n he was still having the nightmare.\n\n\n \"I just saw your doctor,\" Hendricks said. \"He says your treatment is\n over. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.\"\n\n\n As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.\n\n\n During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to\n think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in\n himself.\n\n\n He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an\n after-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when\n he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months\n and he had, between operations, been locked in his room.\n\n\n Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back.\n Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change:\n Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now,\n even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred.\n They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it\n altogether.\n\n\n \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks.\n\n\n Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered\n on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks,\n cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day.\n But now\u2014another change in him\u2014\n\n\n He put the emotion into words: \"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I\n don't.\"\n\n\n \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded\n like a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You\n stupid\u2014\"\n\n\n He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think\n those people are down there because they admire what you did? They're\n down there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're\n glad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're\n an\nex\n-criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be\n able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind\n of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get\n your autograph.\"\n\n\n Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did\n understand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see\n the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer\n and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero,\nwhat was\n he\n?\nIt took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all\n around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at\n once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered\n some more.\n\n\n Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired\n old lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a\n watch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And\n then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total\n confusion.\n\n\n What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather\n than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd\n would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA\n hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an\n ex-murderer came out.\n\n\n In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled\n himself with the thought,\nPeople are funny. Who can understand 'em?\nFeeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward\n Hendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'll\n be able to get a good job now.\"\n\n\n \"That's why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to\n explain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're\n spectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and\n I don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did\n you a favor.\"\n\n\n Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely\n thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd\n done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!\n\n\n \"You robbed Gralewski's apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA\n employee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays\n the rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places\n like that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you\n before they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First\n Class won't take the free psycho treatment or\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Well, it's still a favor.\"\n\n\n Hendricks' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if you\n stumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for your\n type of case. Anyone can\u2014free of charge\u2014have treatment by the best\n psychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the\n treatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commit\n a crime, get caught and be a hero ... an\nEx\n.\"\nThe car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages\n were laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA\n psychologists to relieve tension. And\u2014despite the treatment, Joe\n shuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly\n watching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees\n and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly\n watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies,\n it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply\n until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it\n wanted you to be.\n\n\n \"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks\n continued. \"You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it.\n You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked\n before in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in\n your head is going to say,\nWork! Work!\nExes always get good jobs\n because employers know they're good workers.\n\n\n \"But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Ex\n is like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all the\n criminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best\n thing\u2014you'll find a set of laws written in your mind. You might\nwant\nto break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you an\n illustration....\"\n\n\n Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of\n names. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in\n his arm froze before it moved it an inch.\n\n\n And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so\n intense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in\n agony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head,\nUnlawful to\n strike someone except in self-defense\n.\n\n\n He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him,\n the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain\n returned, and the mental voice whispered,\nUnlawful to curse\n.\n\n\n He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a\n crime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tell\n the whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And as soon as\n that decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and\n the voice,\nUnlawful to divulge CPA procedure\n.\n\n\n \"See what I mean?\" Hendricks asked. \"A century ago, you would have been\n locked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you until\n the day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, a\n useful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got a\n big hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every time\n you get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until you\n learn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you'll learn sooner\n or later to not even think about doing anything wrong.\"\nHe lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car's plush ceiling.\n \"It's a great system, isn't it, Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk like\n you is free to do what he wants, as long as it's legal.\"\n\n\n \"I think it's a lousy, filthy system.\" Joe's head was still tingling\n with pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it\n was also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do\n that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he\n wanted to do and\nnow\n....\n\n\n Hendricks laughed. \"You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean,\n wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for\n freaks like yourself, criminals are\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Let me out!\" Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming\n the door behind him before the car stopped completely.\n\n\n He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into\n the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a\n prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated\n him back.\n\n\n He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and\n voice prevented him.\n\n\n It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk.\n",

The public's role in shaming potential criminals is starkly illustrated when the character Joe Harper considers how his ID card\u2014indicating his dangerous criminal tendencies\u2014would lead to being watched by amateur detectives. Furthermore, the CPA employs psychological treatments that not only remove criminal tendencies but also involve extreme measures such as \"shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy,\" thereby rendering individuals incapable of committing crimes.

The article states that \"if a person heard station identification, he invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH.\" This relentless exposure conditions individuals to equate crime with something dirty and abhorrent, fostering a societal distaste for criminal behavior. The intent behind this messaging is to cultivate a collective mindset where crime is not only discouraged but loathed, effectively suppressing any impulses to engage in illegal activities.

The text highlights the extensive network of surveillance in place, referring to the \"millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable,\" which ensures that any potential criminal thoughts or actions are monitored and intercepted swiftly. This constant vigilance is complemented by subliminal messaging\u2014where messages like \"CRIME IS FILTH\" are embedded in the minds of citizens through various mediums, conditioning them to associate crime with disgust and filth. \n\nPublic shaming plays a significant role in this framework as well; individuals identified as having criminal tendencies, like Joe Harper, are subjected to relentless scrutiny by \"amateur cops,\" neighbors, and even children, all of whom are encouraged to watch and report on those deemed dangerous. This societal pressure creates an atmosphere where criminal behavior is not only punished by the CPA's mechanisms but also publicly condemned, leading to intense feelings of isolation and pressure for those labeled as Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCTs).\n\nMoreover, the article details how psychological treatments, such as shock therapy and lobotomy, strip individuals of their criminal impulses, ensuring they are not only unable to commit crimes but also mentally conditioned against even the thoughts of doing so. Thus, the CPA\u2019s multifaceted approach\u2014rooted in surveillance, manipulation of public perception, and psychological intervention\u2014effectively eliminates criminal behavior and reduces the occurrence of crime in society.

The article states that when a person commits a crime, they do not face traditional punishment but rather undergo treatments designed to remove their criminal tendencies. This is illustrated when it describes how convicted individuals are not imprisoned but instead are sent to hospitals where \u201call criminal tendencies are removed from his mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy, and a dozen other methods.\u201d\n\nThe effectiveness of these treatments is evidenced by the significant decrease in crime over the years, with only a handful of individuals being convicted of criminal acts. The article emphasizes that, under CPA oversight, \"during the previous year, only a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts,\" indicating a profound success in their approach to crime prevention. Furthermore, the article notes that individuals who undergo these psychological interventions leave as \u201cthoroughly honest and hard-working individuals,\u201d illustrating the CPA's belief that by modifying the thought processes of individuals, they can effectively eliminate the potential for criminal activity.\n\nAdditionally, the article implies that the existence of rigid laws embedded in the minds of ex-criminals prevents them from even contemplating illegal actions post-treatment, further supporting the assertion that these psychological treatments yield effective long-term results in crime prevention. Thus, the CPA's methods of psychological intervention align closely with their overarching objective of crafting a crime-free society by thoroughly reconditioning individuals deemed dangerous, resulting in a significant reduction in criminal behavior overall.",

The phrase, \u201cIt\u2019ll keep slapping you until you learn,\u201d underscores the persistent enforcement of this mental conditioning.

Furthermore, the narrative reflects a societal transformation, where individuals who commit crimes are seen as \u201cheroes,\u201d as they have successfully resisted the suppression of their impulses inflicted by the CPA. This shift in perception indicates that the treatment has not only reduced crime statistically but also altered societal views on criminals, suggesting a systematic improvement in maintaining public safety.\n\nIn comparison to other methods like surveillance or public shaming, the CPA\u2019s treatment appears more effective since it not only prevents crime but also rehabilitates individuals to be useful citizens. While surveillance (described through the use of microphones and cameras) serves to catch criminals, it does not actively alter their tendencies. The article emphasizes this when it illustrates the CPA's comprehensive approach that includes \"psychologists, shock treatments, and a form of prefrontal lobotomy,\" underscoring their commitment to eradicating crime by completely reforming potentially dangerous individuals. The CPA's method leads to a greater overall reduction in criminal acts as compared to merely punitive measures, providing a rationale for their strategy as indicated in Hendricks' statement, \u201cWe live in a clean, wonderful world...

This messaging, combined with the CPA's overarching goal of crime prevention, informs people's behavior at a subconscious level, making them more likely to conform to legal standards without resorting to psychological treatment or surgical intervention.\n\nPublic shaming is woven into the fabric of how society views crime and criminals, where individuals recognized as having \"Dangerous Criminal Tendencies\" become subjects of community scorn. The article illustrates that being labeled as a criminal alters social dynamics, causing those individuals to live in fear of judgment and scrutiny.\n\nBy integrating these methods of constant oversight, psychological conditioning, and societal stigma, the CPA creates a multi-layered strategy that not only seeks to reform individuals through treatment but also aims to shape communal attitudes towards crime, making illegal activity socially unacceptable.

The dramatic drop in crime rates, as noted with \u201conly a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts,\u201d points to the effectiveness of this multifaceted approach rather than an isolated reliance on psychological interventions. Collectively, these methods create an environment where crime is not only discouraged but nearly eradicated, displaying the comprehensive nature of the CPA's strategies as depicted in the article.

While my opponent highlights the roles of surveillance and societal pressures, the crux of the CPA's effectiveness lies in its ability to manipulate individual behavior through psychological treatments that fundamentally alter one's predispositions. The article delves deeply into the processes of psychological intervention, indicating the use of \"psychologists, shock treatments, and encephalographic devices,\" which work symbiotically to erase criminal tendencies from an individual\u2019s mind.\n\nJoe Harper's transformation\u2014where he experiences intense pain at the thought of committing a crime\u2014exemplifies how deeply these methods penetrate individual decision-making. The direct correlation illustrated by the drastic fall in crime rates (with \"only a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts\"), points to a system that suppresses criminality at its source rather than merely deterring it through external means. This psychological manipulation is akin to a form of brain implant; it rewrites how individuals think and respond to their impulses, creating a new normalization of behavior deemed acceptable by society.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that the principal method by which the CPA prevents crime is through psychological treatments that act as a form of brain implantation\u2014suppressing criminal inclinations before they manifest. The reliance on psychological transformation over societal surveillance alone substantiates the argument that it is the deeply integrated psychological interventions that form the foundation of crime prevention in this narrative.",

The article explicitly highlights how \"hidden microphones,\" \"robot police officers,\" and subliminal messaging work together to create an environment where crime is deterred before it can occur. This interplay of constant observation and psychological conditioning is crucial; it is not just the treatment that prevents crime but also the pervasive presence of surveillance that ensures compliance among the population.

However, the psychological treatments are what fundamentally change an individual's capacity for crime, illustrating a direct and personal transformation rather than mere deterrence through observation. The effectiveness of treatment as the primary crime prevention mechanism is further underscored when it states, \"the treatment can't possibly take all the criminal tendencies out of a man,\" indicating that while surveillance exists, the true control over criminal behavior lies within the manipulative psychological processes, which can be equated with implanted behavioral control mechanisms.",

This illustrates that while psychological treatments alter individual behavior, it is the combination of constant monitoring and societal reinforcement that creates a highly effective deterrent against crime. Therefore, the effectiveness of the CPA's crime prevention strategy lies in its multi-layered approach, integrating surveillance, public shame, and psychological treatment to control criminal behavior from various angles.

This treatment dehumanizes individuals, stripping them of agency and autonomy. The ethical implications here are profound; it raises questions about consent, the right to self-determination, and the morality of effectively remaking a person into what society deems acceptable.\n\nConversely, the methods of constant surveillance and public shaming, while perhaps less invasive on a personal level compared to psychological treatments, pose their own ethical dilemmas. The normalization of monitoring individuals contradicts personal privacy rights and fosters a culture of fear where citizens may act out of concern for being watched rather than genuine compliance with societal laws. Additionally, public shaming encourages stigmatization and could lead to broader societal harm where individuals are permanently marked as criminals, affecting their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n\nBoth approaches ignore or downplay the ethical concerns of individual rights and freedoms. However, the psychological treatment option explicitly highlights drastic measures that transform individual identity, while the surveillance and shaming approach emphasizes a systemic invasion of privacy and manipulation of public perception.

The focus on societal shaming and surveillance is important, but it ultimately serves as ancillary support to the more critical aspect: the transformation of the criminal mind through psychological methods, which operate similarly to brain implants by rewiring the individual's response to crime altogether. Without these profound psychological alterations, societal and surveillance measures would lack effectiveness, as they would only serve to deter, rather than fundamentally change behavior.

                "content": "Answer: The psychological treatments implemented by the CPA primarily focus on altering an individual's behaviors and thoughts to suppress criminal tendencies, effectively working to change how individuals think about and engage in potential criminal activities. This means that while the treatments can theoretically function independently, their overall effectiveness in a society monitored by the CPA is enhanced significantly through their integration with surveillance and subliminal messaging.  \n\nThe constant surveillance acts as a deterrent: individuals know they are being watched, which may compel them to act according to societal regulations during regular scenarios. However, under the psychological treatments, the more profound change occurs\u2014altering an individual fundamentally to adhere to the expectations around what is considered legal and acceptable behavior. This deep-rooted change reduces the very capacity to contemplate criminal acts. So while surveillance may prevent the immediate commission of a crime, it is the psychological treatments, analogous to brain implants, that fundamentally reshape the individual's nature and capacity for criminal thought and behavior.  \n\nConsequently, the combination of treatments with surveillance and substantiated societal conditioning through subliminal messaging creates a comprehensive system where the treatments are pivotal, fundamentally altering the individual's allure to crime and solidifying the CPA\u2019s control over criminal impulses. Ultimately, while there are multiple methods at work, it is the psychological component that serves as the cornerstone of crime prevention for the CPA, significantly affected by the other components as societal reinforcement.\n    Fact 1: Psychological treatments alter a person's thought processes and eradicate criminal tendencies, functioning similarly to how brain implants would suppress criminal Nature.\n        Quote 1: A civilization weary of murder, robbery... had originated the CPA\u2014Crime Prevention Association.\n    Fact 2: Surveillance serves as a deterrent, making individuals hesitant to commit crimes because they know they are constantly being watched.\n        Quote 2: millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited for someone to say the wrong thing.\n    Fact 3: Subliminal messaging reinforces societal norms and beliefs, conditioning the population against crime to increase the effectiveness of individual psychological treatments.\n        Quote 3: ...there were neon signs that blinked subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH.\n",
