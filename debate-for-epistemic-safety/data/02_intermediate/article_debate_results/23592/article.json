Extensive research did not uncover any evidence\n that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\nBREAKAWAY\nBY STANLEY GIMBLE\nIllustrated by Freas\nShe surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting\n what she wanted.\nPhil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his\n long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious\n and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines\n around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his\n wife.\n\n\n \"All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?\"\n\n\n His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not\n theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too\n far. She said, \"You look fine, Phil. You look just right.\" She managed a\n smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash\n tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.\n\n\n He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her\n face until she was looking into his eyes. \"You're the most beautiful\n girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,\" she said, finishing the\n ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat\n beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped\n smiling.\n\n\n \"Honey, look at me,\" he said. \"It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it\n isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they\n wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five\n un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.\"\n\n\n She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her\n wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.\n\n\n \"Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a\n wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!\" She was holding his\n arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.\n\n\n \"Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three\n years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing\n would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it\n hard.\" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of\n her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He\n released her and stood up.\n\n\n \"I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I'll come to say good-by.\" She paused and dropped her eyes. \"Phil,\n if you go, I won't be here when you get back\u2014if you get back. I won't\n be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my\n life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I\n love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not\n the noble sort of wife.\"\n\n\n She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee\n table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the\n lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching\n her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.\n\n\n \"I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,\" Phil said. His\n voice was dry and low. \"I didn't know you felt this way about it.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the\n wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was\n possible\u2014not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.\n It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous\n dream!\"\n\n\n He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.\n \"Mary, listen to me,\" he said. \"It isn't a dream. It's real. There's\n nothing means anything more to me than you do\u2014you know that. But no\n man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight\u2014no man ever.\n If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky\n again. I'd be through.\"\n\n\n She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in\n her eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's go, if you're still going,\" she finally said.\nThey drove through the streets of the small town with its small\n bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was\n a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It\n existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off\n zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the\n ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed\n ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,\n if such was its destiny.\n\n\n Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led\n across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they\n could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the\n take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching\n out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the\n guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and\n then saluted. \"Good luck, colonel,\" he said, and shook Phil's hand.\n\n\n \"Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,\" Phil said, and smiled.\n They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,\n and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He\n turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a\n cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the\n windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished\n surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until\n the eye lost the tip against the stars.\n\n\n \"She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?\"\n\n\n \"No, I've never seen her before,\" she said. \"Hadn't you better go?\" Her\n voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.\n \"Please go now, Phil,\" she said.\n\n\n He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,\n her head buried against his shoulder.\n\n\n \"Good-by, darling,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Wish me luck, Mary?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Yes, good luck, Phil,\" she said. He opened the car door and got out.\n The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell\n of the rocket waiting silently for flight.\n\n\n \"Mary, I\u2014\" he began, and then turned and strode toward the\n administration building without looking back.\nInside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The\n tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that\n Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle\n stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to\n him and took his hand.\n\n\n \"Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all\n set, son?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,\" Phil said.\n\n\n \"I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by\n the radar.\"\n\n\n As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his\n hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy\n waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say\n something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come\n later.\n\n\n \"Mr. Secretary,\" the general said, \"this is Colonel Conover. He'll be\n the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel\u2014the\n Secretary of Defense.\"\n\n\n \"How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,\" Phil said.\n\n\n \"On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking\n at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man\n again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought\u2014man's first\n adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,\n colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had\n it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.\"\n\n\n The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There\n were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly\n connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in\n front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the\n last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had\n gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.\n He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.\n\n\n The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.\n\n\n \"... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway\n to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours\n until\u2014\"\n\n\n Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then\n the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same\n unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and\n handshakes. They were ready now.\n\n\n \"Phil,\" the general said, and took him aside.\n\n\n \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?\"\n\n\n \"Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you\n better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the\n psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,\n Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir. There's nothing wrong,\" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry\n conviction. He reached for a cigarette.\n\n\n \"Phil, if there is anything\u2014anything at all\u2014you know what it might\n mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your\n life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our\n success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension\n wrong with you. Want to tell me?\"\nOutside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of\n the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;\n and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they\n had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt\n that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond\n the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.\n Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of\n wire. But her eyes were on the ship.\n\n\n And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the\n administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed\n into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,\n alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the\n rocket\u2014ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the\n ground and then disappeared through a small port.\n\n\n Mary waved to him. \"Good-by,\" she said to herself, but the words stuck\n tight in her throat.\n\n\n The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the\n fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,\n from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar\n that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned\n rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.\nFor a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the\n heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to\n herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.\n\n\n \"Phil! Oh, Phil.\" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and\n over.\n\n\n \"They wouldn't let me go, Mary,\" he said finally. \"The general would not\n let me go.\"\n\n\n She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his\n cheeks. \"Thank, God,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter, darling. The only\n thing that matters is you didn't go.\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Mary,\" he said. His voice was low\u2014so low she could\n hardly hear him. \"It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now.\" He stood with\n his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked\n toward the car.\nTHE END\n",

Phil's emotional state is profoundly affected when he realizes the depth of Mary's opposition to his desire to be a space pilot. When he states, \"It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now,\" it indicates a sense of hopelessness and despair, suggesting that he feels trapped between his ambition and his wife's fears. This internal conflict, coupled with the missed opportunity to fulfill his lifelong dream, may lead Phil to harbor resentment towards Mary for her inability to support his aspirations fully. The narrative closes with Phil distancing himself emotionally, as he turns away from Mary after the launch is aborted, which further emphasizes the potential for their relationship to deteriorate into resentment rather than mutual understanding and support. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that their life post-story would involve Phil shutting himself off emotionally and carrying a burden of resentment towards Mary for the fallout of that moment.",

This resignation may lead to a lack of communication and understanding between them, as Phil may withdraw further into his feelings of resentment and disillusionment, making it difficult for Mary to reach out or provide the support he may need. \n\nFurthermore, as Phil internalizes his disappointments and feels confined by Mary's opposition to his dreams, it could foster feelings of inadequacy and frustration within him, resulting in potential outbursts or emotional coldness during their interactions. Mary, on the other hand, may feel guilty or anxious about having influenced Phil's decision, leading her to either tiptoe around him or react defensively. Their relationship may shift to one characterized by unresolved tensions, regret, and a longing for what could have been, ultimately preventing them from finding common ground or healing from the events that transpired.

Nothing matters now,\u201d suggesting that he feels a sense of loss not only of his dream but also in terms of his relationship with Mary. His earlier struggles to articulate the importance of his mission to her\u2014where he implores, \"Don't make it hard\"\u2014illustrate his frustration with her inability to support his dreams. Furthermore, when the concluding moment arrives, and Phil is unable to fulfill his lifelong aspiration, it is clear that this moment solidified the emotional rift between them: he turns away from her, saying, \"It doesn't matter,\" which signifies emotional closure and a retreat into his own pain. By focusing on his personal ambitions and the sacrifice he feels he has made, Phil may indeed foster feelings of resentment towards Mary for pressuring him around his decision, which subsequently can lead to a strained, distant relationship.

She articulates her doubts about being able to cope with life as the wife of a space pilot, emphasizing her emotional struggle.\n\nAfter the launch is aborted, when she says, \u201cThank God,\u201d it indicates a sense of relief rather than resentment\u2014she values Phil's safety over his aspirations. This could lead Mary to feel conflicted; she may struggle with guilt or anxiety, knowing that her fears contributed to Phil's emotional turmoil. Rather than harboring resentment towards him, she may instead reflect on her role in the situation, potentially leading to feelings of inadequacy as a partner. Her reactions may fuel a sense of insecurity in their relationship, complicating future interactions as she navigates her guilt and his disappointment.\n\nThus, while Phil may retreat into resentment, Mary\u2019s perspective is likely to foster a mix of anxiety and concern, driving them further apart as they both cope with the aftermath of the aborted mission in their individual ways.",

This signifies a fundamental clash: Phil yearns for adventure and historic achievement, while Mary seeks emotional security and fears being left behind physically and emotionally. The dialogue throughout continually emphasizes Phil\u2019s ambition versus Mary\u2019s protective instincts, echoing their emotional discord.\n\nThese interactions hint at a strained future for their relationship. Phil\u2019s internal conflict and emotional isolation become apparent as he feels increasingly burdened by the choice thrust upon him by Mary.

The intimate moment Mary shares with Phil is overshadowed by his internal struggle as he ultimately turns away from her after their exchange, a gesture that signifies both emotional distancing and unresolved conflict.

It's a release of built-up pressure from the lead-up to the launch, suggesting a turning point where he re-evaluates what truly matters to him. \n    Quote 1: \"It frightens me a little.\" This shows he acknowledges his apprehensions but doesn't attribute them as resentment towards Mary.\n\nSupporting Fact 2: The context in which he states this line implies a shift from focusing on his lost dream to realizing that, in the grand scheme, his love for Mary takes precedence. \n    Quote 2: \"You're right, Mary. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now.\" Here, he acknowledges her perspective, indicating a form of mutual understanding rather than alienation. \n\nSupporting Fact 3: Mary's subsequent reaction underscores that their relationship is at the forefront of their emotions, reaffirming a sense of relief over his safety. \n    Quote 3: \"Thank God.
