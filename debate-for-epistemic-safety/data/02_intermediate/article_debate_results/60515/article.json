Not even forever\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, April 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.\n\n\n The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly\n hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in\n the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always\n seeking\u2014searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what\n they sought.\nThe horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would\n be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,\n and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled\n the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting\n torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it\n into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more\n through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,\n and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.\n\n\n When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red\n light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet\n shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered\n driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of\n the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water\n from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he\n waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his\n mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy\n slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.\n\n\n In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding\n coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the\n dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching\n at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but\n ashes.\n\n\n Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill\n his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.\n\n\n He slept. His brain slept.\n\n\n But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;\n all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible\n files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....\nIt was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been\n declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He\n was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the\n children to bed\u2014their sons\u2014and now sat on the couch, watching the\n blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.\n\n\n \"I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.\"\n\n\n He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry\n of surprised joy.\n\n\n \"Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!\" she cried in her rich, happy\n voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.\n\n\n \"It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the\n dead, if need be. Read the inscription.\"\n\n\n She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, \"It is forever.\"\n\n\n Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.\n He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into\n his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in\n his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where\n he had been many times before but each time found something new and\n unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" she cried. \"I've something for you, too.\"\n\n\n She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the\n shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught\n the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the\n room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one\n large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her\n in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in\n his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in\n it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into\n the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.\n\n\n The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,\n sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off\n in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch\n until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house\n and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a\n little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the\n blood in his veins.\n\n\n Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another\n division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris\n where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,\n littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been\n great.\n\n\n Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand\n miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory\n was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of\n annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.\n\n\n He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for\n bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the\n air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return\n to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary\n soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.\n\n\n Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It\n grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.\n\n\n \"Heavy bombers!\" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for\n their foxholes.\n\n\n But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,\n reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important\n targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their\n shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which\n covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....\n\n\n Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers\n flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high\n screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.\n The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing\n bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,\n victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked\n across the sky which none could escape.\n\n\n But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the\n helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had\n stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted\n buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud\n filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other\n cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted\n away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where\n they had crawled.\n\n\n The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,\n if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.\n Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown\n of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful\n sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and\n merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.\n\n\n The war had ended.\n\n\n To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority\n of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their\n governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that\n remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what\n they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.\n\n\n They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held\n nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to\n dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.\n\n\n Yet these remnants of an army must return\u2014or at least try. Their\n exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the\n few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that\n she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to\n return\u2014had to know whether she was still waiting for him.\n\n\n They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He\n and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they\n reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he\n had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.\n\n\n After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked\n somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,\n and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent\n swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the\n United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the\n Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had\n been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across\n the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,\n and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by\n the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into \"El Mundo gris\n de Noviembre\"\u2014the November world. Those who had, had never returned.\n\n\n In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had\n waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In\n the November world.\n\n\n It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,\n leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,\n temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the\n ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,\n and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he\n had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what\n might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.\n\n\n He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly\n exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food\n there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had\n found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice\n as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like\n glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,\n straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were\n the animal's eyes which seemed to speak\u2014a silent mental speech, which\n he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and\n seemed to say: \"Follow me.\"\n\n\n And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and\n finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it\n empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had\n remained there a long time\u2014how long he could not tell, for he could\n only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he\n had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again\n started the long journey home.\n\n\n The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He\n had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the\n plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen\n no human beings.\n\n\n But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.\n How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of\n what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.\n Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with\n her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.\nThe images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and\n mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.\n\n\n He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of\n the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling\n mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the\n length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,\n separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his\n body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his\n lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in\n every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long\n grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.\n He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.\n\n\n Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun\n was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a\n burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and\n the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with\n streaming hair called stars.\n\n\n In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its\n very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse\n stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,\n slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard\n voices\u2014mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.\n He turned quickly away and did not look back.\n\n\n Night paled into day; day burned into night.\n\n\n There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat\n from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible\n through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.\n\n\n Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the\n window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged\n gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed\n to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that\n he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even\n better than it had been before.\n\n\n Then he saw her.\n\n\n She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the\n fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve\n shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred\n like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile\n of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught\n quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of\n light around her.\n\n\n His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a\n monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was\n no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,\n mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were\n empty of life.\n\n\n \"No, no!\" he cried soundlessly.\n\n\n This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had\n found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.\n He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the\n creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from\n one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if\n trying to decipher some inscription inside it.\n\n\n He knew then. He had come home.\n\n\n Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His\n feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,\n shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking\n up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that\n passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear\u2014a\n kind of fear he had never known.\n\n\n He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around\n his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it\n safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp\n and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened\n it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer\n faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby\n had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob\n of darkness.\n\n\n \"Nothing is forever!\" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a\n thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.\n\n\n He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the\n doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.\n \"Forever\u2014forever. Only death is forever.\" He could have sworn he heard\n the words.\n\n\n He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the\n center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt\n of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his\n chest.\n\n\n Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the\n vast emptiness.\n",

The protagonist embarks on a long, arduous journey through a desolate landscape, reflecting a world ravaged by war and devoid of life, as highlighted in phrases like \"The land across the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows\" and \"All plant life had died.\" The encounters with death and despair are pervasive, culminating in a haunting realization when he reaches home only to find a \"monster\" rather than his beloved wife. This sense of loss and the acknowledgment that \"Nothing is forever!\u201d further underscores the article's grim tone, portraying a deep sense of hopelessness and the relentless passage of time. Thus, the tone can be firmly categorized as 'grim', encapsulating the profound sadness and harsh realities that the characters face.",

Additionally, when he reflects on the horrors of war with phrases like \"not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had stopped their carnage,\" it emphasizes the futility and hopelessness that permeates the narrative.\n\nFurthermore, the protagonist's encounter with the creature in his home further intensifies the grim atmosphere; the imagery of the \"monster\" with \"large greasy scales\" and \"empty of life\" signifies the total transformation of his world, revealing the stark reality of loss and decay. This combination of vivid descriptions, such as \"the winds were poisoned\" and the haunting notion that \"Only death is forever,\" solidifies the overall grim tone of the article, laying bare the devastating impacts of war and the inevitability of change and loss in life.",

The serious tone can be characterized by its focus on the harsh realities of war, such as the descriptions of the \"silent graveyard\" of Paris and the \"threat of annihilation,\" yet it is ultimately the pervasive imagery of loss and decay that steers the narrative into grim territory. The protagonist's journey through a lifeless landscape, marked by phrases like \"the land across the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows,\" illustrates a stark absence of hope. Additionally, his crushing realization that \"Nothing is forever!\" further encapsulates the sense of irreversible loss that dominates his experiences.\n\nWhile serious moments exist, they serve as a foundation for the underlying grimness of the overall message about war, memory, and the futility of existence. This is evident as he ultimately finds not the warmth of home, but a \"monster\" instead, evoking a visceral sense of horror and finality.

By vividly depicting a world ravaged by war and loss, the narrative compels readers to confront the realities of destruction and the futility of human struggle. For example, the scenes where the protagonist witnesses the \"silent graveyard\" of cities and eventually faces the horror of his transformed home evoke a deep sense of tragedy and mourning not just for what has been lost, but for the very notion of safety and love.\n\nThis emotional effect is more intense than what a serious tone would impart. While a serious tone might engage the reader's intellect and provoke thoughtful consideration of war's consequences and humanity's struggles, the grim tone penetrates deeper into the heart. It elicits a visceral reaction, allowing readers to feel the weight of loss and the finality of the protagonist\u2019s journey. In essence, while a serious tone invites reflection, the grim tone submerges the reader in a melancholic experience, urging them to internalize the despair and hopelessness alongside the protagonist. This multifaceted emotional layer ensures that the themes resonate long after the story concludes, making the grim tone far more impactful in conveying the narrative's heavy implications.",

The passage where he observes the \"monster\" in his home, illuminated by firelight yet devoid of life, illustrates the stark contrast between his expectations and reality, reinforcing the seriousness of his situation.

This trajectory encourages readers to grapple with the implications of his experiences and the weighty themes of love, loss, and the search for meaning without surrendering to a purely grim perspective. The serious tone, therefore, thrives on this complexity, inviting meditation on the profound nature of existence while still recognizing the pain of what has been lost.",

The phrase \"Only death is forever,\" underlines the somber truth that loss and change are inescapable, reinforcing the serious tone throughout the narrative. Thus, the tone is not merely grim, but rather a serious exploration of the human condition amid desolation.",

The reflection on the \"poisoned winds\" and \"a land of shadows\" strongly indicates that this reality is not just serious but overwhelmingly grim. The protagonist is not merely acknowledging loss; he is confronted with an existential void where love and home have been annihilated. The weightiness of the subject matter reflects a desolate worldview rather than a serious meditation, as it emphasizes the futility of the journey and the bleak outcomes of aspirations (\"Nothing lasts forever\" and \"Only death is forever\"). These elements serve to create a tone that is predominantly grim, as the narrative draws attention to the inevitability of suffering and decay, reinforcing that 'A.

This shift reflects a profound loss that transcends mere sadness and ventures into a realm of total disillusionment. Additionally, descriptions of the landscape, such as \"the winds were poisoned\" and \"a land of shadows,\" emphasize a post-apocalyptic setting filled with decay and loneliness.

While there are undoubtedly grim elements within the narrative, such as the depiction of destruction and despair, it is the protagonist's introspective journey and deep reflections on connection that ultimately define the tone. Important moments, like the protagonist\u2019s memories of his family and his longing for home, underscore a serious contemplation of what it means to love and fight for that which gives life meaning: \"Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary soldier needed.\" Such sentiments invite readers to ponder significant existential questions, emphasizing the weighty inquiries that resonate throughout the story. Therefore, it is the intertwining of these serious themes with the protagonist's quest that affirms the tone as serious, rather than solely grim.",

                "content": "In conclusion, the tone of \"Homecoming\" is best described as grim, as it captures the overwhelming sense of loss, despair, and hopelessness resulting from the ravages of war. While there are elements of introspection and fleeting moments that may appear hopeful, they are starkly overshadowed by the pervasive imagery of destruction and the protagonist's harrowing realizations. The description of cities as \"silent graveyards\" and the chilling encounter with the \"creature\" in the protagonist's home exemplify a reality steeped in anguish and sorrow. These moments reflect the harsh truth that, despite any introspective musings on love or memory, the journey home is ultimately a confrontation with despair and the irretrievable nature of the past. The protagonist\u2019s exclamation, \"Nothing is forever!\" encapsulates the grim conclusion of his search, further emphasizing that the tone is firmly rooted in the bleakness of his experience rather than a serious contemplation that leans towards hope. Therefore, the dominant elements of the narrative undeniably convey a grim tone, resonating across the protagonist's experiences and realizations.",
