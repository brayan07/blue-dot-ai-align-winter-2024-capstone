    "article": "THE MADMAN FROM EARTH\nBY KEITH LAUMER\nYou don't have to be crazy to be an earth\n\n diplomat\u2014but on Groac it sure helps!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nI\n\n\n \"The Consul for the Terrestrial States,\" Retief said, \"presents his\n compliments, et cetera, to the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian\n Autonomy, and with reference to the Ministry's invitation to attend a\n recital of interpretive grimacing, has the honor to express regret that\n he will be unable\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You can't turn this invitation down,\" Administrative Assistant Meuhl\n said flatly. \"I'll make that 'accepts with pleasure'.\"\n\n\n Retief exhaled a plume of cigar smoke.\n\n\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" he said, \"in the past couple of weeks I've sat through\n six light-concerts, four attempts at chamber music, and god knows how\n many assorted folk-art festivals. I've been tied up every off-duty\n hour since I got here\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You can't offend the Groaci,\" Miss Meuhl said sharply. \"Consul Whaffle\n would never have been so rude.\"\n\n\n \"Whaffle left here three months ago,\" Retief said, \"leaving me in\n charge.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Miss Meuhl said, snapping off the dictyper. \"I'm sure I don't\n know what excuse I can give the Minister.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind the excuses,\" Retief said. \"Just tell him I won't be\n there.\" He stood up.\n\n\n \"Are you leaving the office?\" Miss Meuhl adjusted her glasses. \"I have\n some important letters here for your signature.\"\n\n\n \"I don't recall dictating any letters today, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said,\n pulling on a light cape.\n\"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted\n them.\"\n\n\n \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n\n\n \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n \"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n\n\n \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't\n be so busy.\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes\n up?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n\n\n Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac\n for four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put\n the present government in power?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I haven't pried into\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this\n way about ten years back?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we\navoid\nwith the\n Groaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\n raking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down\n the fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\n occasion.\"\n\n\n \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n\n\n \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\n grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try\n never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\n\n\n \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\n\n\n Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before\n you close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim\n disapproval as he closed the door.\nThe pale-featured Groacian vibrated his throat-bladder in a distressed\n bleat.\n\n\n \"Not to enter the Archives,\" he said in his faint voice. \"The denial of\n permission. The deep regret of the Archivist.\"\n\n\n \"The importance of my task here,\" Retief said, enunciating the glottal\n dialect with difficulty. \"My interest in local history.\"\n\n\n \"The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.\"\n\n\n \"The necessity that I enter.\"\n\n\n \"The specific instructions of the Archivist.\" The Groacian's voice rose\n to a whisper. \"To insist no longer. To give up this idea!\"\n\n\n \"OK, Skinny, I know when I'm licked,\" Retief said in Terran. \"To keep\n your nose clean.\"\n\n\n Outside, Retief stood for a moment looking across at the deeply carved\n windowless stucco facades lining the street, then started off in the\n direction of the Terrestrial Consulate General. The few Groacians on\n the street eyed him furtively, veered to avoid him as he passed. Flimsy\n high-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement.\n The air was clean and cool.\n\n\n At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of\n complaints.\n\n\n Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street.\n An elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the\n Groacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in.\n\n\n A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from\n the bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in\n mid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot.\n\n\n \"To enjoy a cooling drink,\" Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at\n the edge of the pit. \"To sample a true Groacian beverage.\"\n\n\n \"To not enjoy my poor offerings,\" the Groacian mumbled. \"A pain in the\n digestive sacs; to express regret.\"\n\n\n \"To not worry,\" Retief said, irritated. \"To pour it out and let me\n decide whether I like it.\"\n\n\n \"To be grappled in by peace-keepers for poisoning of\u2014foreigners.\" The\n barkeep looked around for support, found none. The Groaci customers,\n eyes elsewhere, were drifting away.\n\n\n \"To get the lead out,\" Retief said, placing a thick gold-piece in the\n dish provided. \"To shake a tentacle.\"\n\n\n \"The procuring of a cage,\" a thin voice called from the sidelines. \"The\n displaying of a freak.\"\nRetief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture\n of contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the\n creature was drunk.\n\n\n \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes\n toward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\"\n\n\n \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk\n whispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered\n toward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\"\n\n\n \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly.\n\n\n \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The\n barkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,\n took his arms and helped him to the door.\n\n\n \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own\n stinking place.\"\n\n\n \"I've changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful\n as hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the\n door. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked\n at the weaving alien.\n\n\n \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered.\n\n\n \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\"\n\n\n \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\"\n\n\n \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum\n with you.\"\n\n\n \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\"\n\n\n \"To have a drink together\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief.\n Retief backed away.\n\n\n \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy\u2014\"\n\n\n The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,\n head down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow\n crossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,\n who followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow\n alley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following\n Groacian.\n\n\n Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian\n fell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;\n Retief put a foot against his chest and pushed.\n\n\n \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay\n right here and have a nice long talk.\"\nII\n\n\n \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There\n are two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\"\n\n\n \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his\n cape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign\n Ministry.\"\n\n\n \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind telling\n you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\"\n\n\n Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments\n indicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a\n courteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.\n\n\n \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\n Consul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present\n Shluh, of the Internal Police?\"\n\n\n \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said. They resumed their seats. Miss\n Meuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's such a pleasure\u2014\" she began.\n\n\n \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn't come here to\n sip tea today.\"\n\n\n \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,\n Mr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police\n chief.\n\n\n \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought\n to hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this\n individual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a\n foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department\n indicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of\n the Terrestrial Consul.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.\n\n\n \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a\n Terrestrial cruiser, the\nISV Terrific\n, which dropped from sight in\n this sector nine years ago?\"\n\n\n \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped.\n\n\n \"I'll not be a party\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I'm\n telling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl sat down.\n\n\n Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound,\n Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial\n hands\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but\n it hits a sour note with me.\"\n\n\n \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible\n episode! And you\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac\n and sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny\n answers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.\n Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe\u2014at the most. If they were\n innocent.\"\n\n\n \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out.\n\n\n \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest\n your\u2014\"\n\"Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don't\n think your story will be good enough.\"\n\n\n \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\n\n\n \"Then you admit\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to\n it.\"\n\n\n Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\n\n\n \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for\n your diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force\n paid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial\n diplomatic mission.\"\n\n\n \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\n \"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It\n has outdone itself\u2014\"\n\n\n \"\u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief\n said. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've\n visaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the\n diplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or\n your satellite\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of\n this matter\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do\n the talking,\" Retief said.\n\n\n \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\n\n\n Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The\n Groaci sat down.\n\n\n \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years\n back\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here. Some\n curious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,\n they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the\n streets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.\n\n\n \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to\n communicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the\n parade was over?\"\nFith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\n retracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\n mouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n\n\n \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\n throats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\n out for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\n yell....\"\n\n\n \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\n once.\"\n\n\n \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\n narco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\n parade.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\n was no killing.\"\n\n\n \"They're alive?\"\n\n\n \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n\n\n \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n\n\n \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\n foods\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n\n\n \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n\n\n \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\n more information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?\n What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the\n big parade?\"\n\n\n \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n\n\n \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n\n\n \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\n Terrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were\n strange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\n\n\n \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\n\n\n \"Guns? No, no guns\u2014\"\n\n\n \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;\n helped them to death.\"\n\n\n \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n\n\n \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\n for them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a\n brisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\n call, eh?\"\n\n\n \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\n strange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\n felt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\n came, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our\n guilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our\n friendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made\n a blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make\n amends....\"\n\n\n \"Where is the ship?\"\n\n\n \"The ship?\"\n\n\n \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget.\n Where is it?\"\n\n\n The two Groacians exchanged looks.\n\n\n \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the\n ship.\"\n\n\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don't come back in a reasonable length\n of time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He\n stood, looked at the Groaci.\n\n\n \"Let's go,\" he said.\nRetief stooped under the heavy timbers shoring the entry to the cavern.\n He peered into the gloom at the curving flank of the space-burned hull.\n\n\n \"Any lights in here?\" he asked.\n\n\n A Groacian threw a switch. A weak bluish glow sprang up.\n\n\n Retief walked along the raised wooden catwalk, studying the ship. Empty\n emplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was\n visible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words 'IVS\n Terrific B7 New Terra' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy.\n\n\n \"How did you get it in here?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,\"\n Fith said, his voice thinner than ever. \"This is a natural crevasse.\n The vessel was lowered into it and roofed over.\"\n\n\n \"How did you shield it so the detectors didn't pick it up?\"\n\n\n \"All here is high-grade iron ore,\" Fith said, waving a member. \"Great\n veins of almost pure metal.\"\n\n\n Retief grunted. \"Let's go inside.\"\n\n\n Shluh came forward with a hand-lamp. The party entered the ship.\n\n\n Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior\n of the control compartment. Dust was thick on the deck, the stanchions\n where acceleration couches had been mounted, the empty instrument\n panels, the litter of sheared bolts, scraps of wire and paper. A thin\n frosting of rust dulled the exposed metal where cutting torches had\n sliced away heavy shielding. There was a faint odor of stale bedding.\n\n\n \"The cargo compartment\u2014\" Shluh began.\n\n\n \"I've seen enough,\" Retief said.\n\n\n Silently, the Groacians led the way back out through the tunnel and\n into the late afternoon sunshine. As they climbed the slope to the\n steam car, Fith came to Retief's side.\n\n\n \"Indeed, I hope that this will be the end of this unfortunate affair,\"\n he said. \"Now that all has been fully and honestly shown\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You can skip all that,\" Retief said. \"You're nine years late. The\n crew was still alive when the task force called, I imagine. You killed\n them\u2014or let them die\u2014rather than take the chance of admitting what\n you'd done.\"\n\n\n \"We were at fault,\" Fith said abjectly. \"Now we wish only friendship.\"\n\n\n \"The\nTerrific\nwas a heavy cruiser, about twenty thousand tons.\"\n Retief looked grimly at the slender Foreign Office official. \"Where is\n she, Fith? I won't settle for a hundred-ton lifeboat.\"\nFith erected his eye stalks so violently that one eye-shield fell off.\n\n\n \"I know nothing of ... of....\" He stopped. His throat vibrated rapidly\n as he struggled for calm.\n\n\n \"My government can entertain no further accusations, Mr. Consul,\"\n he said at last. \"I have been completely candid with you, I have\n overlooked your probing into matters not properly within your sphere of\n responsibility. My patience is at an end.\"\n\n\n \"Where is that ship?\" Retief rapped out. \"You never learn, do you?\n You're still convinced you can hide the whole thing and forget it. I'm\n telling you you can't.\"\n\n\n \"We return to the city now,\" Fith said. \"I can do no more.\"\n\n\n \"You can and you will, Fith,\" Retief said. \"I intend to get to the\n truth of this matter.\"\n\n\n Fith spoke to Shluh in rapid Groacian. The police chief gestured to his\n four armed constables. They moved to ring Retief in.\n\n\n Retief eyed Fith. \"Don't try it,\" he said. \"You'll just get yourself in\n deeper.\"\n\n\n Fith clacked his mandibles angrily, eye stalks canted aggressively\n toward the Terrestrial.\n\n\n \"Out of deference to your diplomatic status, Terrestrial, I shall\n ignore your insulting remarks,\" Fith said in his reedy voice. \"Let us\n now return to the city.\"\n\n\n Retief looked at the four policemen. \"I see your point,\" he said.\n\n\n Fith followed him into the car, sat rigidly at the far end of the seat.\n\n\n \"I advise you to remain very close to your consulate,\" Fith said. \"I\n advise you to dismiss these fancies from your mind, and to enjoy the\n cultural aspects of life at Groac. Especially, I should not venture out\n of the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to\n the Groacian government.\"\n\n\n In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung\n vehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to\n the rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing.\nIII\n\n\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said, \"I want you to listen carefully to what I'm\n going to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off\n guard.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,\" Miss Meuhl snapped,\n her eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses.\n\n\n \"If you'll listen, you may find out,\" Retief said. \"I have no time\n to waste, Miss Meuhl. They won't be expecting an immediate move\u2014I\n hope\u2014and that may give me the latitude I need.\"\n\n\n \"You're still determined to make an issue of that incident!\" Miss\n Meuhl snorted. \"I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a\n sophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.\"\n\n\n \"You're ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it's not what\n happened nine years ago I'm concerned with. It's what's happening now.\n I've told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out.\n Don't you understand the implication? That vessel couldn't have come\n far. The cruiser itself must be somewhere near by. I want to know\n where!\"\n\n\n \"The Groaci don't know. They're a very cultured, gentle people. You can\n do irreparable harm to the reputation of Terrestrials if you insist\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's my decision,\" Retief said. \"I have a job to do and we're\n wasting time.\" He crossed the room to his desk, opened a drawer and\n took out a slim-barreled needler.\n\n\n \"This office is being watched. Not very efficiently, if I know the\n Groaci. I think I can get past them all right.\"\n\n\n \"Where are you going with ... that?\" Miss Meuhl stared at the needler.\n \"What in the world\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The Groaci won't waste any time destroying every piece of paper in\n their files relating to this thing. I have to get what I need before\n it's too late. If I wait for an official Inquiry Commission, they'll\n find nothing but blank smiles.\"\n\n\n \"You're out of your mind!\" Miss Meuhl stood up, quivering with\n indignation. \"You're like a ... a....\"\n\n\n \"You and I are in a tight spot, Miss Meuhl. The logical next move for\n the Groaci is to dispose of both of us. We're the only ones who know\n what happened. Fith almost did the job this afternoon, but I bluffed\n him out\u2014for the moment.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl emitted a shrill laugh. \"Your fantasies are getting the\n better of you,\" she gasped. \"In danger, indeed! Disposing of me! I've\n never heard anything so ridiculous.\"\n\n\n \"Stay in this office. Close and safe-lock the door. You've got food and\n water in the dispenser. I suggest you stock up, before they shut the\n supply down. Don't let anyone in, on any pretext whatever. I'll keep in\n touch with you via hand-phone.\"\n\n\n \"What are you planning to do?\"\n\n\n \"If I don't make it back here, transmit the sealed record of this\n afternoon's conversation, along with the information I've given you.\n Beam it through on a mayday priority. Then tell the Groaci what you've\n done and sit tight. I think you'll be all right. It won't be easy to\n blast in here and anyway, they won't make things worse by killing you.\n A force can be here in a week.\"\n\n\n \"I'll do nothing of the sort! The Groaci are very fond of me! You ...\n Johnny-come-lately! Roughneck! Setting out to destroy\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Blame it on me if it will make you feel any better,\" Retief said, \"but\n don't be fool enough to trust them.\" He pulled on a cape, opened the\n door.\n\n\n \"I'll be back in a couple of hours,\" he said. Miss Meuhl stared after\n him silently as he closed the door.\nIt was an hour before dawn when Retief keyed the combination to the\n safe-lock and stepped into the darkened consular office. He looked\n tired.\n\n\n Miss Meuhl, dozing in a chair, awoke with a start. She looked at\n Retief, rose and snapped on a light, turned to stare.\n\n\n \"What in the world\u2014Where have you been? What's happened to your\n clothing?\"\n\n\n \"I got a little dirty. Don't worry about it.\" Retief went to his desk,\n opened a drawer and replaced the needler.\n\n\n \"Where have you been?\" Miss Meuhl demanded. \"I stayed here\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you did,\" Retief said. \"I hope you piled up a supply of food\n and water from the dispenser, too. We'll be holed up here for a week,\n at least.\" He jotted figures on a pad. \"Warm up the official sender. I\n have a long transmission for Regional Headquarters.\"\n\n\n \"Are you going to tell me where you've been?\"\n\n\n \"I have a message to get off first, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said sharply.\n \"I've been to the Foreign Ministry,\" he added. \"I'll tell you all about\n it later.\"\n\n\n \"At this hour? There's no one there....\"\n\n\n \"Exactly.\"\n\n\n Miss Meuhl gasped. \"You mean you broke in? You burgled the Foreign\n Office?\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Retief said calmly. \"Now\u2014\"\n\n\n \"This is absolutely the end!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"Thank heaven I've\n already\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Get that sender going, woman!\" Retief snapped. \"This is important.\"\n\n\n \"I've already done so, Mr. Retief!\" Miss Meuhl said harshly. \"I've been\n waiting for you to come back here....\" She turned to the communicator,\n flipped levers. The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance\n image appeared.\n\n\n \"He's here now,\" Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief\n triumphantly.\n\n\n \"That's good,\" Retief said. \"I don't think the Groaci can knock us off\n the air, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"I made a full\n report to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this\n office. Any doubts I may have had as to the rightness of that decision\n have been completely dispelled by what you've just told me.\"\n\n\n Retief looked at her levelly. \"You've been a busy girl, Miss Meuhl. Did\n you mention the six Terrestrials who were killed here?\"\n\n\n \"That had no bearing on the matter of your wild behavior! I must say,\n in all my years in the Corps, I've never encountered a personality less\n suited to diplomatic work.\"\nThe screen crackled, the ten-second transmission lag having elapsed.\n \"Mr. Retief,\" the face on the screen said, \"I am Counsellor Pardy,\n DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region. I have received a\n report on your conduct which makes it mandatory for me to relieve you\n administratively, vice Miss Yolanda Meuhl, DAO-9. Pending the findings\n of a Board of Inquiry, you will\u2014\"\n\n\n Retief reached out and snapped off the communicator. The triumphant\n look faded from Miss Meuhl's face.\n\n\n \"Why, what is the meaning\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If I'd listened any longer, I might have heard something I couldn't\n ignore. I can't afford that, at this moment. Listen, Miss Meuhl,\"\n Retief went on earnestly, \"I've found the missing cruiser.\"\n\n\n \"You heard him relieve you!\"\n\n\n \"I heard him say he was\ngoing\nto, Miss Meuhl. But until I've heard\n and acknowledged a verbal order, it has no force. If I'm wrong, he'll\n get my resignation. If I'm right, that suspension would be embarrassing\n all around.\"\n\n\n \"You're defying lawful authority! I'm in charge here now.\" Miss Meuhl\n stepped to the local communicator.\n\n\n \"I'm going to report this terrible thing to the Groaci at once, and\n offer my profound\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't touch that screen,\" Retief said. \"You go sit in that corner\n where I can keep an eye on you. I'm going to make a sealed tape for\n transmission to Headquarters, along with a call for an armed task\n force. Then we'll settle down to wait.\"\n\n\n Retief ignored Miss Meuhl's fury as he spoke into the recorder.\n\n\n The local communicator chimed. Miss Meuhl jumped up, staring at it.\n\n\n \"Go ahead,\" Retief said. \"Answer it.\"\n\n\n A Groacian official appeared on the screen.\n\n\n \"Yolanda Meuhl,\" he said without preamble, \"for the Foreign Minister of\n the Groacian Autonomy, I herewith accredit you as Terrestrial Consul\n to Groac, in accordance with the advices transmitted to my government\n direct from the Terrestrial Headquarters. As consul, you are requested\n to make available for questioning Mr. J. Retief, former consul, in\n connection with the assault on two peace keepers and illegal entry into\n the offices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\"\n\n\n \"Why, why,\" Miss Meuhl stammered. \"Yes, of course. And I do want to\n express my deepest regrets\u2014\"\nRetief rose, went to the communicator, assisted Miss Meuhl aside.\n\n\n \"Listen carefully, Fith,\" he said. \"Your bluff has been called. You\n don't come in and we don't come out. Your camouflage worked for nine\n years, but it's all over now. I suggest you keep your heads and resist\n the temptation to make matters worse than they are.\"\n\n\n \"Miss Meuhl,\" Fith said, \"a peace squad waits outside your consulate.\n It is clear you are in the hands of a dangerous lunatic. As always, the\n Groaci wish only friendship with the Terrestrials, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't bother,\" Retief said. \"You know what was in those files I looked\n over this morning.\"\n\n\n Retief turned at a sound behind him. Miss Meuhl was at the door,\n reaching for the safe-lock release....\n\n\n \"Don't!\" Retief jumped\u2014too late.\n\n\n The door burst inward. A crowd of crested Groaci pressed into the room,\n pushed Miss Meuhl back, aimed scatter guns at Retief. Police Chief\n Shluh pushed forward.\n\n\n \"Attempt no violence, Terrestrial,\" he said. \"I cannot promise to\n restrain my men.\"\n\n\n \"You're violating Terrestrial territory, Shluh,\" Retief said steadily.\n \"I suggest you move back out the same way you came in.\"\n\n\n \"I invited them here,\" Miss Meuhl spoke up. \"They are here at my\n express wish.\"\n\n\n \"Are they? Are you sure you meant to go this far, Miss Meuhl? A squad\n of armed Groaci in the consulate?\"\n\n\n \"You are the consul, Miss Yolanda Meuhl,\" Shluh said. \"Would it not be\n best if we removed this deranged person to a place of safety?\"\n\n\n \"You're making a serious mistake, Shluh,\" Retief said.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"You're quite right, Mr. Shluh. Please escort\n Mr. Retief to his quarters in this building\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I don't advise you to violate my diplomatic immunity, Fith,\" Retief\n said.\n\n\n \"As chief of mission,\" Miss Meuhl said quickly, \"I hereby waive\n immunity in the case of Mr. Retief.\"\n\n\n Shluh produced a hand recorder. \"Kindly repeat your statement, Madam,\n officially,\" he said. \"I wish no question to arise later.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, woman,\" Retief said. \"Don't you see what you're\n letting yourself in for? This would be a hell of a good time for you to\n figure out whose side you're on.\"\n\n\n \"I'm on the side of common decency!\"\n\n\n \"You've been taken in. These people are concealing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You think all women are fools, don't you, Mr. Retief?\" She turned to\n the police chief and spoke into the microphone he held up.\n\n\n \"That's an illegal waiver,\" Retief said. \"I'm consul here, whatever\n rumors you've heard. This thing's coming out into the open, whatever\n you do. Don't add violation of the Consulate to the list of Groacian\n atrocities.\"\n\n\n \"Take the man,\" Shluh said.\n",

For instance, her insistence that Retief cannot offend the Groaci by rejecting their invitation\u2014\"You can't offend the Groaci,\"\u2014demonstrates her focus on compliance with their cultural norms. She appears more concerned with maintaining proper diplomatic relations than mentoring Retief in understanding the nuances of Groacian culture. This mindset is reinforced when she expresses her disapproval of Retief's intentions to investigate the past incidents with the Groaci, as she warns, \"Those are just the sort of questions we avoid with the Groaci.\" Her actions suggest that her priority lies in upholding the Groacians' feelings and expectations, indicating that her enjoyment of the job is embedded in fulfilling those customs rather than providing cultural guidance.

Additionally, her discontent when Retief wishes to investigate historical incidents demonstrates her inclination to avoid stirring any perceived discontent with the Groaci, as she insists, \"These are the sort of questions we avoid with the Groaci.\" This reaction suggests her priority is not on fostering a deeper cultural understanding for Retief, but on ensuring they comply with Groacian expectations to maintain peace. Her overall demeanor conveys more of a sense of duty and obligation to uphold diplomatic propriety than genuine enthusiasm for educating Retief about the intricacies of Groacian culture. This indicates her enjoyment of her job is rooted in the satisfaction of fulfilling diplomatic roles rather than through active mentoring.",

Additionally, her dedication to doing things \"just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted them\" suggests that she derives satisfaction from adhering to established practices that she believes will ensure successful relations. While she may also show some inclination toward guiding Retief, her primary focus appears centered on compliance and maintaining harmony with the Groacians. This dedication reflects an enjoyment rooted in fulfilling her role effectively and respectfully within the diplomatic context, ultimately supporting the assertion that she enjoys doing her job the way the Groacians like it. Her actions throughout the narrative confirm that her pleasure in her work is intrinsically tied to her commitment to the cultural dynamics at play, solidifying the position that the correct answer is that she enjoys doing her job in accordance with Groacian customs.",

Her insistence on the importance of not offending the Groaci indicates a foundational understanding of the significance of cultural sensitivities, which she seems eager to impart to Retief. Consider her statement, \"You can't offend the Groaci,\" which demonstrates her desire for Retief to grasp the delicate nature of their diplomatic relationship, suggesting she values the role of mentoring. Furthermore, her actions convey a sense of responsibility towards preparing Retief for his role in this culture, as she ardently defends the practices of her predecessors, which implies that she finds pleasure in teaching these protocols to someone new to the diplomatic arena. This dual focus on personal duty and guiding Retief showcases her enjoyment in not only complying with Groacian customs but also in equipping Retief with the tools to navigate these complexities.
