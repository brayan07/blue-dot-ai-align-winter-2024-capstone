But Ned Vince lived\n again\u2014a million years later!\n\"See\n you in half an hour,\n Betty,\" said Ned Vince\n over the party telephone. \"We'll\n be out at the Silver Basket before\n ten-thirty....\"\n\n\n Ned Vince was eager for the\n company of the girl he loved.\n That was why he was in a hurry\n to get to the neighboring town\n of Hurley, where she lived. His\n old car rattled and roared as he\n swung it recklessly around Pit\n Bend.\n\n\n There was where Death tapped\n him on the shoulder. Another car\n leaped suddenly into view, its\n lights glaring blindingly past a\n high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic\n rock at the turn of the road.\n\n\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his\n own rash speed, Ned Vince had\n only swift young reflexes to rely\n on to avoid a fearful, telescoping\n collision. He flicked his wheel\n smoothly to the right; but the\n County Highway Commission\n hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened\n gravel at the Bend.\nAn incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures.\nNed could scarcely have chosen\n a worse place to start sliding and\n spinning. His car hit the white-painted\n wooden rail sideways,\n crashed through, tumbled down\n a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,\n bounced up a little, and\n arced outward, falling as gracefully\n as a swan-diver toward the\n inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet\n beneath....\n\n\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious\n when that black, quiet\n pool geysered around him in a\n mighty splash. He had only a\n dazing welt on his forehead, and\n a gag of terror in his throat.\n\n\n Movement was slower now, as\n he began to sink, trapped inside\n his wrecked car. Nothing that he\n could imagine could mean doom\n more certainly than this. The Pit\n was a tremendously deep pocket\n in the ground, spring-fed. The\n edges of that almost bottomless\n pool were caked with a rim of\n white\u2014for the water, on which\n dead birds so often floated, was\n surcharged with alkali. As that\n heavy, natronous liquid rushed\n up through the openings and\n cracks beneath his feet, Ned\n Vince knew that his friends and\n his family would never see his\n body again, lost beyond recovery\n in this abyss.\n\n\n The car was deeply submerged.\n The light had blinked out on the\n dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute\n darkness. A flood rushed\n in at the shattered window. He\n clawed at the door, trying to\n open it, but it was jammed in\n the crash-bent frame, and he\n couldn't fight against the force\n of that incoming water. The\n welt, left by the blow he had received\n on his forehead, put a\n thickening mist over his brain,\n so that he could not think clearly.\n Presently, when he could no\n longer hold his breath, bitter\n liquid was sucked into his lungs.\n\n\n His last thoughts were those\n of a drowning man. The machine-shop\n he and his dad had\n had in Harwich. Betty Moore,\n with the smiling Irish eyes\u2014like\n in the song. Betty and he\n had planned to go to the State\n University this Fall. They'd\n planned to be married sometime....\n Goodbye, Betty ...\n\n\n The ripples that had ruffled\n the surface waters in the Pit,\n quieted again to glassy smoothness.\n The eternal stars shone\n calmly. The geologic Dakota\n hills, which might have seen the\n dinosaurs, still bulked along the\n highway. Time, the Brother of\n Death, and the Father of\n Change, seemed to wait....\n\"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,\n tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\n\n\n The excited cry, which no human\n throat could quite have duplicated\n accurately, arose thinly\n from the depths of a powder-dry\n gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable\n antiquity. The noon-day\n Sun was red and huge. The\n air was tenuous, dehydrated,\n chill.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,\n tik!...\"\n\n\n At first there was only one\n voice uttering those weird, triumphant\n sounds. Then other\n vocal organs took up that trilling\n wail, and those short, sharp\n chuckles of eagerness. Other\n questioning, wondering notes\n mixed with the cadence. Lacking\n qualities identifiable as human,\n the disturbance was still like the\n babble of a group of workmen\n who have discovered something\n remarkable.\n\n\n The desolate expanse around\n the gulch, was all but without\n motion. The icy breeze tore tiny\n puffs of dust from grotesque,\n angling drifts of soil, nearly\n waterless for eons. Patches of\n drab lichen grew here and there\n on the up-jutting rocks, but in\n the desert itself, no other life\n was visible. Even the hills had\n sagged away, flattened by incalculable\n ages of erosion.\nAt a mile distance, a crumbling\n heap of rubble arose. Once\n it had been a building. A gigantic,\n jagged mass of detritus\n slanted upward from its crest\u2014red\n debris that had once been\n steel. A launching catapult for\n the last space ships built by the\n gods in exodus, perhaps it was\u2014half\n a million years ago. Man\n was gone from the Earth. Glacial\n ages, war, decadence, disease,\n and a final scattering of those\n ultimate superhumans to newer\n worlds in other solar systems,\n had done that.\n\n\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n The sounds were not human.\n They were more like the chatter\n and wail of small desert animals.\n\n\n But there was a seeming paradox\n here in the depths of that\n gulch, too. The glint of metal,\n sharp and burnished. The flat,\n streamlined bulk of a flying machine,\n shiny and new. The bell-like\n muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,\n which seemed to\n depend on a blast of atoms to\n clear away rock and soil. Thus\n the gulch had been cleared of the\n accumulated rubbish of antiquity.\n Man, it seemed, had a successor,\n as ruler of the Earth.\n\n\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological\n expedition out from the\n far lowlands to the east, out\n from the city of Kar-Rah. And\n he was very happy now\u2014flushed\n with a vast and unlooked-for\n success.\n\n\n He crouched there on his\n haunches, at the dry bottom of\n the Pit. The breeze rumpled his\n long, brown fur. He wasn't very\n different in appearance from his\n ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,\n as he squatted there in that antique\n stance of his kind. His tail\n was short and furred, his undersides\n creamy. White whiskers\n spread around his inquisitive,\n pink-tipped snout.\n\n\n But his cranium bulged up and\n forward between shrewd, beady\n eyes, betraying the slow heritage\n of time, of survival of the fittest,\n of evolution. He could think and\n dream and invent, and the civilization\n of his kind was already\n far beyond that of the ancient\n Twentieth Century.\n\n\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers\n were gathered, tense and\n gleeful, around the things their\n digging had exposed to the daylight.\n There was a gob of junk\u2014scarcely\n more than an irregular\n formation of flaky rust. But imbedded\n in it was a huddled form,\n brown and hard as old wood. The\n dry mud that had encased it\n like an airtight coffin, had by\n now been chipped away by the\n tiny investigators; but soiled\n clothing still clung to it, after\n perhaps a million years. Metal\n had gone into decay\u2014yes. But\n not this body. The answer to this\n was simple\u2014alkali. A mineral\n saturation that had held time\n and change in stasis. A perfect\n preservative for organic tissue,\n aided probably during most of\n those passing eras by desert dryness.\n The Dakotas had turned\n arid very swiftly. This body was\n not a mere fossil. It was a\n mummy.\n\"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.\n Not the star-conquering demi-gods,\n but the ancestral stock\n that had built the first\n machines on Earth, and in the\n early Twenty-first Century, the\n first interplanetary rockets. No\n wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers\n were happy in their\n paleontological enthusiasm! A\n strange accident, happening in a\n legendary antiquity, had aided\n them in their quest for knowledge.\n\n\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,\n chirping signal. The chant of\n triumph ended, while instruments\n flicked in his tiny hands.\n The final instrument he used to\n test the mummy, looked like a\n miniature stereoscope, with complicated\n details. He held it over\n his eyes. On the tiny screen\n within, through the agency of\n focused X-rays, he saw magnified\n images of the internal organs\n of this ancient human\n corpse.\n\n\n What his probing gaze revealed\n to him, made his pleasure\n even greater than before. In\n twittering, chattering sounds, he\n communicated his further knowledge\n to his henchmen. Though\n devoid of moisture, the mummy\n was perfectly preserved, even to\n its brain cells! Medical and biological\n sciences were far advanced\n among Loy Chuk's kind.\n Perhaps, by the application of\n principles long known to them,\n this long-dead body could be\n made to live again! It might\n move, speak, remember its past!\n What a marvelous subject for\n study it would make, back there\n in the museums of Kar-Rah!\n\n\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\n\n\n But Loy silenced this fresh,\n eager chattering with a command.\n Work was always more\n substantial than cheering.\nWith infinite care\u2014small,\n sharp hand-tools were used, now\u2014the\n mummy of Ned Vince was\n disengaged from the worthless\n rust of his primitive automobile.\n With infinite care it was crated\n in a metal case, and hauled into\n the flying machine.\n\n\n Flashing flame, the latter\n arose, bearing the entire hundred\n members of the expedition.\n The craft shot eastward at bullet-like\n speed. The spreading\n continental plateau of North\n America seemed to crawl backward,\n beneath. A tremendous\n sand desert, marked with low,\n washed-down mountains, and the\n vague, angular, geometric\n mounds of human cities that\n were gone forever.\n\n\n Beyond the eastern rim of the\n continent, the plain dipped downward\n steeply. The white of dried\n salt was on the hills, but there\n was a little green growth here,\n too. The dead sea-bottom of the\n vanished Atlantic was not as\n dead as the highlands.\n\n\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,\n the city of the rodents,\n came into view\u2014a crystalline\n maze of low, bubble-like structures,\n glinting in the red sunshine.\n But this was only its surface\n aspect. Loy Chuk's people\n had built their homes mostly underground,\n since the beginning\n of their foggy evolution. Besides,\n in this latter day, the\n nights were very cold, the shelter\n of subterranean passages and\n rooms was welcome.\n\n\n The mummy was taken to Loy\n Chuk's laboratory, a short distance\n below the surface. Here at\n once, the scientist began his\n work. The body of the ancient\n man was put in a large vat.\n Fluids submerged it, slowly\n soaking from that hardened flesh\n the alkali that had preserved it\n for so long. The fluid was\n changed often, until woody muscles\n and other tissues became\n pliable once more.\n\n\n Then the more delicate processes\n began. Still submerged in\n liquid, the corpse was submitted\n to a flow of restorative energy,\n passing between complicated\n electrodes. The cells of antique\n flesh and brain gradually took on\n a chemical composition nearer to\n that of the life that they had\n once known.\nAt last the final liquid was\n drained away, and the mummy\n lay there, a mummy no more, but\n a pale, silent figure in its tatters\n of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,\n metal-fabric helmet on its head,\n and a second, much smaller helmet\n on his own. Connected with\n this arrangement, was a black\n box of many uses. For hours he\n worked with his apparatus,\n studying, and guiding the recording\n instruments. The time\n passed swiftly.\n\n\n At last, eager and ready for\n whatever might happen now,\n Loy Chuk pushed another switch.\n With a cold, rosy flare, energy\n blazed around that moveless\n form.\n\n\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity\n ended like a gradual fading\n mist. When he could see clearly\n again, he experienced that inevitable\n shock of vast change\n around him. Though it had been\n dehydrated, his brain had been\n kept perfectly intact through the\n ages, and now it was restored.\n So his memories were as vivid as\n yesterday.\n\n\n Yet, through that crystalline\n vat in which he lay, he could see\n a broad, low room, in which he\n could barely have stood erect. He\n saw instruments and equipment\n whose weird shapes suggested\n alienness, and knowledge beyond\n the era he had known! The walls\n were lavender and phosphorescent.\n Fossil bone-fragments were\n mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur\n bones, some of them\n seemed, from their size. But\n there was a complete skeleton of\n a dog, too, and the skeleton of a\n man, and a second man-skeleton\n that was not quite human. Its\n neck-vertebrae were very thick\n and solid, its shoulders were\n wide, and its skull was gigantic.\n\n\n All this weirdness had a violent\n effect on Ned Vince\u2014a sudden,\n nostalgic panic. Something\n was fearfully wrong!\n\n\n The nervous terror of the unknown\n was on him. Feeble and\n dizzy after his weird resurrection,\n which he could not understand,\n remembering as he did\n that moment of sinking to certain\n death in the pool at Pit\n Bend, he caught the edge of the\n transparent vat, and pulled himself\n to a sitting posture. There\n was a muffled murmur around\n him, as of some vast, un-Earthly\n metropolis.\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\n\n\n The words themselves, and the\n way they were assembled, were\n old, familiar friends. But the\n tone was wrong. It was high,\n shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.\n Ned's gaze searched for the\n source of the voice\u2014located the\n black box just outside of his\n crystal vat. From that box the\n voice seemed to have originated.\n Before it crouched a small,\n brownish animal with a bulging\n head. The animal's tiny-fingered\n paws\u2014hands they were, really\u2014were\n touching rows of keys.\n\n\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly\n insane and incomprehensible.\n A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,\n a little; but plainly possessing\n a high order of intelligence.\n And a voice whose soothingly\n familiar words were more repugnant\n somehow, simply because\n they could never belong in a\n place as eerie as this.\n\n\n Ned Vince did not know how\n Loy Chuk had probed his brain,\n with the aid of a pair of helmets,\n and the black box apparatus. He\n did not know that in the latter,\n his language, taken from his\n own revitalized mind, was recorded,\n and that Loy Chuk had\n only to press certain buttons to\n make the instrument express his\n thoughts in common, long-dead\n English. Loy, whose vocal organs\n were not human, would have had\n great difficulty speaking English\n words, anyway.\n\n\n Ned's dark hair was wildly\n awry. His gaunt, young face\n held befuddled terror. He gasped\n in the thin atmosphere. \"I've\n gone nuts,\" he pronounced with\n a curious calm. \"Stark\u2014starin'\u2014nuts....\"\nLoy's box, with its recorded\n English words and its sonic detectors,\n could translate for its\n master, too. As the man spoke,\n Loy read the illuminated symbols\n in his own language, flashed\n on a frosted crystal plate before\n him. Thus he knew what Ned\n Vince was saying.\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,\n and the box reproduced his answer:\n \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a\n bit of it! There are just a lot of\n things that you've got to get\n used to, that's all. You drowned\n about a million years ago. I discovered\n your body. I brought you\n back to life. We have science\n that can do that. I'm Loy\n Chuk....\"\nIt took only a moment for the\n box to tell the full story in clear,\n bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy\n sought, with calm, human logic,\n to make his charge feel at home.\n Probably, though, he was a fool,\n to suppose that he could succeed,\n thus.\n\n\n Vince started to mutter,\n struggling desperately to reason\n it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.\n \"Speaking to me. One million\n years. Evolution. The scientists\n say that people grew up from\n fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs\n are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs\n could come from\n them. A lot easier than men\n from fish....\"\n\n\n It was all sound logic. Even\n Ned Vince knew that. Still, his\n mind, tuned to ordinary, simple\n things, couldn't quite realize all\n the vast things that had happened\n to himself, and to the\n world. The scope of it all was too\n staggeringly big. One million\n years. God!...\n\n\n Ned Vince made a last effort\n to control himself. His knuckles\n tightened on the edge of the vat.\n \"I don't know what you've been\n talking about,\" he grated wildly.\n \"But I want to get out of here!\n I want to go back where I came\n from! Do you understand\u2014whoever,\n or whatever you are?\"\n\n\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.\n \"But you can't go back to the\n Twentieth Century,\" said the\n box. \"Nor is there any better\n place for you to be now, than\n Kar-Rah. You are the only man\n left on Earth. Those men that\n exist in other star systems are\n not really your kind anymore,\n though their forefathers originated\n on this planet. They have\n gone far beyond you in evolution.\n To them you would be only a\n senseless curiosity. You are\n much better off with my people\u2014our\n minds are much more like\n yours. We will take care of you,\n and make you comfortable....\"\n\n\n But Ned Vince wasn't listening,\n now. \"You are the only\n man left on Earth.\" That had\n been enough for him to hear. He\n didn't more than half believe it.\n His mind was too confused for\n conviction about anything. Everything\n he saw and felt and\n heard might be some kind of\n nightmare. But then it might all\n be real instead, and that was\n abysmal horror. Ned was no\n coward\u2014death and danger of\n any ordinary Earthly kind, he\n could have faced bravely. But the\n loneliness here, and the utter\n strangeness, were hideous like\n being stranded alone on another\n world!\n\n\n His heart was pounding heavily,\n and his eyes were wide. He\n looked across this eerie room.\n There was a ramp there at the\n other side, leading upward instead\n of a stairway. Fierce impulse\n to escape this nameless\n lair, to try to learn the facts for\n himself, possessed him. He\n bounded out of the vat, and\n with head down, dashed for the\n ramp.\nHe had to go most of the way\n on his hands and knees, for the\n up-slanting passage was low. Excited\n animal chucklings around\n him, and the occasional touch of\n a furry body, hurried his feverish\n scrambling. But he emerged\n at last at the surface.\n\n\n He stood there panting in that\n frigid, rarefied air. It was night.\n The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked\n bulk. The constellations\n were unrecognizable. The rodent\n city was a glowing expanse of\n shallow, crystalline domes, set\n among odd, scrub trees and\n bushes. The crags loomed on all\n sides, all their jaggedness lost\n after a million years of erosion\n under an ocean that was gone.\n In that ghastly moonlight, the\n ground glistened with dry salt.\n\n\n \"Well, I guess it's all true,\n huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a\n flat tone.\n\n\n Behind him he heard an excited,\n squeaky chattering. Rodents\n in pursuit. Looking back,\n he saw the pinpoint gleams of\n countless little eyes. Yes, he\n might as well be an exile on another\n planet\u2014so changed had the\n Earth become.\n\n\n A wave of intolerable homesickness\n came over him as he\n sensed the distances of time that\n had passed\u2014those inconceivable\n eons, separating himself from\n his friends, from Betty, from almost\n everything that was familiar.\n He started to run, away\n from those glittering rodent\n eyes. He sensed death in that\n cold sea-bottom, but what of it?\n What reason did he have left to\n live? He'd be only a museum\n piece here, a thing to be caged\n and studied....\n\n\n Prison or a madhouse would\n be far better. He tried to get\n hold of his courage. But what\n was there to inspire it? Nothing!\n He laughed harshly as he\n ran, welcoming that bitter, killing\n cold. Nostalgia had him in\n its clutch, and there was no answer\n in his hell-world, lost beyond\n the barrier of the years....\nLoy Chuk and his followers\n presently came upon Ned Vince's\n unconscious form, a mile from\n the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying\n machine they took him back, and\n applied stimulants. He came to,\n in the same laboratory room as\n before. But he was firmly\n strapped to a low platform this\n time, so that he could not escape\n again. There he lay, helpless,\n until presently an idea occurred\n to him. It gave him a few crumbs\n of hope.\n\n\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\n\n\n \"You'd better get some rest,\n Ned Vince,\" came the answer\n from the black box. It was Loy\n Chuk speaking again.\n\n\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.\n \"You know a lot more than we\n did in the Twentieth Century.\n And\u2014well\u2014there's that thing\n called time-travel, that I used to\n read about. Maybe you know how\n to make it work! Maybe you\n could send me back to my own\n time after all!\"\n\n\n Little Loy Chuk was in a\n black, discouraged mood, himself.\n He could understand the\n utter, sick dejection of this\n giant from the past, lost from\n his own kind. Probably insanity\n looming. In far less extreme circumstances\n than this, death from\n homesickness had come.\n\n\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In\n common with all real scientists,\n regardless of the species from\n which they spring, he loved the\n subjects of his researches. He\n wanted this ancient man to live\n and to be happy. Or this creature\n would be of scant value for\n study.\n\n\n So Loy considered carefully\n what Ned Vince had suggested.\n Time-travel. Almost a legend. An\n assault upon an intangible wall\n that had baffled far keener wits\n than Loy's. But he was bent,\n now, on the well-being of this\n anachronism he had so miraculously\n resurrected\u2014this human,\n this Kaalleee....\n\n\n Loy jabbed buttons on the\n black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"\n said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.\n Perhaps that is the only\n thing to do\u2014to send you back\n to your own period of history.\n For I see that you will never be\n yourself, here. It will be hard to\n accomplish, but we'll try. Now\n I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\n\n\n Ned felt better immediately,\n for there was real hope now,\n where there had been none before.\n Maybe he'd be back in his\n home-town of Harwich again.\n Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop,\n there. And the trees greening\n out in Spring. Maybe he'd\n be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,\n soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny\n hypo-needle bit into his arm....\n\n\n As soon as Ned Vince passed\n into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk\n went to work once more, using\n that pair of brain-helmets again,\n exploring carefully the man's\n mind. After hours of research,\n he proceeded to prepare his\n plans. The government of Kar-Rah\n was a scientific oligarchy,\n of which Loy was a prime member.\n It would be easy to get the\n help he needed.\n\n\n A horde of small, grey-furred\n beings and their machines, toiled\n for many days.\nNed Vince's mind swam\n gradually out of the blur that\n had enveloped it. He was wandering\n aimlessly about in a familiar\n room. The girders of the\n roof above were of red-painted\n steel. His tool-benches were\n there, greasy and littered with\n metal filings, just as they had\n always been. He had a tractor to\n repair, and a seed-drill. Outside\n of the machine-shop, the old,\n familiar yellow sun was shining.\n Across the street was the small\n brown house, where he lived.\n\n\n With a sudden startlement, he\n saw Betty Moore in the doorway.\n She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous\n smile curved her lips.\n As though she had succeeded in\n creeping up on him, for a surprise.\n\n\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.\n \"You look as though you've been\n dreaming, and just woke up!\"\n\n\n He grimaced ruefully as she\n approached. With a kind of fierce\n gratitude, he took her in his\n arms. Yes, she was just like\n always.\n\n\n \"I guess I\nwas\ndreaming,\n Betty,\" he whispered, feeling\n that mighty sense of relief. \"I\n must have fallen asleep at the\n bench, here, and had a nightmare.\n I thought I had an accident\n at Pit Bend\u2014and that a\n lot of worse things happened....\n But it wasn't true ...\"\n\n\n Ned Vince's mind, over which\n there was still an elusive fog that\n he did not try to shake off, accepted\n apparent facts simply.\n\n\n He did not know anything\n about the invisible radiations\n beating down upon him, soothing\n and dimming his brain, so that\n it would never question or doubt,\n or observe too closely the incongruous\n circumstances that must\n often appear. The lack of traffic\n in the street without, for instance\u2014and\n the lack of people\n besides himself and Betty.\n\n\n He didn't know that this machine-shop\n was built from his\n own memories of the original.\n He didn't know that this Betty\n was of the same origin\u2014a miraculous\n fabrication of metal\n and energy-units and soft plastic.\n The trees outside were only\n lantern-slide illusions.\n\n\n It was all built inside a great,\n opaque dome. But there were\n hidden television systems, too.\n Thus Loy Chuk's kind could\n study this ancient man\u2014this\n Kaalleee. Thus, their motives\n were mostly selfish.\n\n\n Loy, though, was not observing,\n now. He had wandered far\n out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to\n ponder. He squeaked and chatted\n to himself, contemplating the\n magnificent, inexorable march of\n the ages. He remembered the ancient\n ruins, left by the final supermen.\n\n\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself\n home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He\n will survive and be happy. But\n there was no other way. Time is\n an Eternal Wall. Our archeological\n researches among the cities\n of the supermen show the truth.\n Even they, who once ruled Earth,\n never escaped from the present\n by so much as an instant....\"\nTHE END\nPRINTED IN U.

For instance, Loy Chuk and his fellow workers engage in paleontological research, showcasing an advanced level of inquiry and a desire for knowledge akin to that of humans in their own pursuit of scientific understanding. The excitement the Kar-Rah display upon discovering the preserved body of Ned Vince illustrates a cultural value placed on exploration and knowledge, much like the scientific endeavors of humans in the 20th century. Additionally, their technological capabilities, as evidenced by the flying machines and advanced medical techniques mentioned in the article, reflect a society built on innovation and intellectual achievement, paralleling the achievements of 20th-century human societies that relied on intellectual advancements to shape their cultures.\n\nThis context supports my argument regarding the significance of large crania as a marker of intelligence. Just as human societies evolved and thrived due to their cognitive capacities, so too have the Kar-Rah developed a complex society informed by their own evolutionary advantages. The large cranium not only represents a shared ancestral trait but also symbolizes the continuity of intellectual progress across millennia, linking the two civilizations in their quest for knowledge and advancement.",

The emphasis in the article is on the evolutionary process and how the Kar-Rah have adapted; however, the key trait that Tolkien focuses on, and which is more indicative of a commonality with 20th-century humans, is their \"not very different\" appearance and function, which aligns with our understanding of posture. Additionally, the text describes the rudimentary physical features of Loy Chuk, such as the tail and fur, which have diverged significantly from human anatomy. Therefore, the evidence supports 'An erect posture' as a more logical connection, indicating that some fundamentals of bipedal physiology remain, unlike the more abstract trait of large crania which may not directly align with the commonalities.",

The text states, \u201cthe heavy, natronous liquid rushed up through...the openings and cracks beneath his feet,\" leading to the conclusion that the water's saturation allowed for \u201ca perfect preservative for organic tissue.\u201d This outcome has a direct correlation to the state of his body when discovered, indicating that without the alkaline water, his body would not have been preserved at all.\n\nIn contrast, the Kar-Rah simulation technology comes into play only after Ned's body has been found. The advanced technology enables the scientists, like Loy Chuk, to revive Ned and simulate an environment that feels familiar to him. It is stated that the laboratory and the \"Betty\" he encounters are constructs of this technology, suggesting a simulation of memories rather than an element that preserved his physical form.\n\nTo summarize, the alkaline water provides the fundamental and biological preservation of Ned's body across eons, while the Kar-Rah simulation technology serves to create a comforting and familiar experience for Ned after his revival. Consequently, the preservation of his physical body is entirely attributed to the alkaline water, while the simulation merely aids in his adaptation to a fantastically changed world. Thus, the comparative analysis firmly establishes that the alkaline water is the primary factor in Ned's survival.",

The alkaline water is described as an excellent preservative, enabling Ned's body to remain intact for millions of years. As it states, \"the alkali that had preserved it for so long\" indicates that without this natural preservation, Ned would not have been found in a state suitable for revival.\n\nHowever, the pivotal role of the Kar-Rah simulation technology comes into focus after his revival. Once Ned is brought back to life, it is this technology that facilitates his transition to life in the future. The article specifically mentions that Loy Chuk \"put an odd, metal-fabric helmet on its head\" and employed \"anesthetic\" while utilizing machines to interact with Ned's revived mind. This illustrates that the simulation craft not only restored his physical form but also created a controlled environment tailored to ease him into understanding his new reality. The text emphasizes, \"You are the only man left on Earth,\" pointing out the existential isolation he faces, which is alleviated by the simulation creating a semblance of home through memories.\n\nIn this way, while the alkaline water is crucial for his physical continuity, it is the Kar-Rah simulation technology that fundamentally allows for Ned's psychological survival and adaptation in a dramatically altered world. This distinction affirms that the technology's impact goes beyond mere preservation; it engages with his mind and spirit in a reality he can cope with. Thus, while both elements are vital, the evidence points to the simulation technology as the more significant factor in ensuring Ned's overall survival and adjustment to life in a new era.",

Tik, tik, tik!...\n    Fact 3.3: Their chant embodies the historical importance of their find, echoing through time as they recognize their connection to a long-lost civilization.\nConclusion: In essence, while the revival by Loy Chuk is celebrated later, the primary excitement and exuberance expressed as 'Kaalleee tik tik tik!' stem from the profound and extraordinary discovery of a human, signifying a pivotal moment in their cultural and archaeological journey.",
