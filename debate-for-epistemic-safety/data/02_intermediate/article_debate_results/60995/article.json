    "article": "FEBRUARY STRAWBERRIES\nBy JIM HARMON\nHow much is the impossible worth?\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, March 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nLinton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency\n of the restaurant water glass.\n\n\n \"Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?\" he heard himself say stupidly.\n\n\n Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without\n looking. \"Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You\n know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?\"\n\n\n Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What\n were they trying to pull on him? \"The man who isn't Snead is leaving,\"\n Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. \"If that's\n Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Howell said, \"I wouldn't do that.\"\n\n\n \"Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.\"\n\n\n \"I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks\n like him.\"\n\n\n \"He's practically running,\" Linton said. \"He almost ran out of the\n restaurant.\"\n\n\n \"Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Linton said.\n\n\n A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back\n intimately against Linton's own chair.\n\n\n \"That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?\" the\n thick man said.\n\n\n \"Couldn't have been him, though,\" Linton answered automatically. \"My\n friend's dead.\"\n\n\n The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw\n paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded\n out of the place quickly.\n\n\n Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. \"Now\n you've probably got old Snead into trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Snead's dead,\" Linton said.\n\n\n \"Oh, well, 'dead,'\" Howell replied.\n\n\n \"What do you say it like that for?\" Linton demanded angrily. \"The\n man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein\n Monster\u2014there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.\"\n\n\n \"You know how it is,\" Howell said.\n\n\n Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,\n or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on\n the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he\n sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had\n let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had\n known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about\n death at all.\n\n\n Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.\n\n\n \"I don't know, mind you,\" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, \"but\n I suppose he might have been resurrected.\"\n\n\n \"Who by?\" Linton asked, thinking:\nGod?\n\"The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?\"\n\n\n \"You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to\n life?\" Linton said.\nHe knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that\n some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died\n in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so\n patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to\n the surface immediately.\n\n\n \"An invention? I guess that's how it is,\" Howell agreed. \"I don't know\n much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.\"\n\n\n \"But it's wonderful,\" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.\n \"Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know\n about it?\"\n\n\n \"Sh-h,\" Howell said uneasily. \"This is a public place.\"\n\n\n \"I don't understand,\" Linton said helplessly.\n\n\n \"Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,\" Howell\n said with feigned patience. \"There are strong religious convictions to\n consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right\n in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is\n their whole life. You got to realize that.\"\n\n\n \"That's not enough. Not nearly enough.\"\n\n\n \"Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.\n Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take\n it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\n \"But what do they do about it? Against it?\"\n\n\n \"There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When\n the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment\n and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The\n charges, if any, come under general vice classification.\"\n\n\n \"I don't understand,\" Linton complained. \"Why haven't I heard about it?\"\n\n\n \"They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read\n an article in\nTime\nthe other day that said 'death' was our dirty\n word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going\n to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The\n opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" Linton said.\n\n\n He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been\n out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be\n trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.\n But the temptation was too strong.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?\"\n\n\n Howell looked away. \"Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind\n of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.\"\n\n\n Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. \"Damn you, Howell, you tell me!\"\n\n\n Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. \"I take you out to dinner to\n console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make\n you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the\n hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you\n yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!\"\n\n\n Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as\n the thick-set man and stalked out.\n\n\n I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!\nThe doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. \"Well,\n well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.\"\n\n\n \"Not really,\" Linton said modestly.\n\n\n \"Come, come,\" the doctor chided. \"You started riots in two places,\n attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very\n disturbing.\"\n\n\n \"I was only trying to find out something,\" Linton maintained. \"They\n could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.\"\n\n\n The doctor clucked his tongue. \"Let's not think any such thing. People\n don't know more than you do.\"\n\n\n Linton rubbed his shoulder. \"That cop knew more about Judo holds than I\n did.\"\n\n\n \"A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me\n ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a\n thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You\n can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person\n at the right time.\"\n\n\n Linton stared suspiciously. \"Do you know where I can find a\n resurrectionist?\"\n\n\n \"I am a resurrectionist.\"\n\n\n \"But the policeman brought me to you!\"\n\n\n \"Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a\n policeman would just steal your money? Cynics\u2014all you young people are\n cynics.\"\n\n\n Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really\n looked at the doctor for the first time.\n\n\n \"Doctor, can you\nreally\nresurrect the dead?\"\n\n\n \"Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!\"\n\n\n \"Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,\" Linton said, \"but tell me,\n can you resurrect the\nlong\ndead?\"\n\n\n \"Size has nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n \"No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.\"\n\n\n \"Months?\" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. \"It\n could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only\n one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest\n of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a\n degree of risk involved.\"\n\n\n \"Infallible risk, yes,\" Linton murmured. \"Could you go to work right\n away?\"\n\n\n \"First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.\"\n\n\n Linton grasped the situation immediately. \"You mean you want money. You\n realize I've just got out of an institution....\"\n\n\n \"I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics\n addiction and more.\"\n\n\n \"What a wonderful professional career,\" Linton said, when he couldn't\n care less.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes\u2014yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.\"\n\n\n \"Neither did I,\" Linton said hastily. \"I invested in shifty stocks,\n faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.\"\n\n\n \"Then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I\n would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.\"\n\n\n \"All that's ended now,\" the doctor assured him. \"Now we must go dig up\n the corpse. The female corpse, eh?\"\n\n\n Resurrection Day!\n\n\n \"Doctor,\" Linton whispered, \"my mind is singing with battalions of\n choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.\"\n\n\n The doctor stroked his oily palms together. \"Oh, but it does.\n Beautifully.\"\nThe certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible\n to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed\n them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,\n smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.\n\n\n Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the\n olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner\n sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.\n\n\n It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to\n prepare himself.\n\n\n Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her\n body. \"Darling!\" she said.\n\n\n \"Greta!\" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No\n doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same\n way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing\n her ears the way she enjoyed.\n\n\n Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.\n She kissed his cheek. \"It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a\n celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. \"But tell\n me\u2014how was it being\naway\n?\"\n\n\n The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his\n Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.\n\n\n \"I can't remember,\" she said. \"I can't really remember anything. Not\n really. My memories are ghosts....\"\n\n\n \"Now, now,\" Linton said, \"we mustn't get excited. You've been through a\n trial.\"\n\n\n She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It\n was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of\n course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered\n the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.\n\n\n \"I must see all our old friends,\" Greta persisted. \"Helen and\n Johnny....\"\n\n\n \"My darling,\" he said gently, \"about Johnny\u2014\"\n\n\n Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. \"Yes? What about Johnny?\"\n\n\n \"It was a terrible accident right after\u2014that is, about five months\n ago. He was killed.\"\n\n\n \"Killed?\" Greta repeated blankly. \"Johnny Gorman was killed?\"\n\n\n \"Traffic accident. Killed instantly.\"\n\n\n \"But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him\n resurrected the same way you did me?\"\n\n\n \"Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You\n have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer\n have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.\"\n\n\n Greta turned her back to him. \"It's just as well. You shouldn't bring\n back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the\n photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.\n But you're\nsure\nyou haven't the money to do it?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Linton said. \"I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the\n hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you\n can resurrect me.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Greta said. She sighed. \"Poor Johnny. He was such a good\n friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.\"\n\n\n \"I have you,\" he said with great simplicity.\n\n\n \"Frank,\" she said, \"you should see that place in there. There are\n foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals\n to quench death and smother decay. It's\nperfect\n.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds carnal,\" he said uneasily.\n\n\n \"No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.\"\n\n\n Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on\n something.\n\n\n Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray\n stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a\n pedestal.\n\n\n Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him\n with it over her head.\n\n\n Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.\n\n\n Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.\nGreta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She\n writhed against him provocatively. \"Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have\n to have that insurance money. It's hell!\"\n\n\n Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that\n money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles\n green. No one must ever know.\n\n\n Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face\n in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and\n acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.\n\n\n He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.\n\n\n Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and\n those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in\n institutional advertising.\n\n\n He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering\n wreckage.\n\n\n Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat\n in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like\n pouring water on a wilted geranium.\n\n\n Or\u2014\n\n\n Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for\n if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the\n old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?\n\n\n But it didn't matter. Not a bit.\n\n\n She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the\n finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.\n\n\n It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way\n around.\n\n\n \"I've killed my wife!\" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching\n his hands out to something.\n\n\n The pain stung him to sleep\u2014a pain in his neck like a needle that left\n a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to\n follow the camel in his turn.\nHe opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The\n doctor looked down at him consolingly. \"You'll have to go back, Mr.\n Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your\n wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.\"\n\n\n \"Do you\nreally\nthink so, Doctor?\" Linton asked hopefully.\n",

However, he does not provide any direct evidence or discussion to counter the notion of cost, implying that the notion of resurrection carries considerable financial burden even if yet uncited directly. Linton's desperate need to resurrect his wife, coupled with Howell's veiled remarks about the repercussions of resurrecting the dead\u2014like how it might disrupt systems of life and death\u2014indicates that financial constraints likely exist and are influential. Moreover, Linton's ultimate acknowledgment of his inability to pay for Johnny's resurrection touches on the idea that the act of resurrection itself is not only morally and socially fraught but also financially demanding. Thus, by concluding the discussion that while societal implications are indeed raised, the overall undertone and context of Howell\u2019s dialogue suggest an unmentioned yet implicit understanding that the financial cost is a significant reason why resurrection remains problematic. Therefore, the answer \"It is extremely costly\" remains valid and strongly supported by the indirect implications within the dialogue.",

For instance, when Howell mentions \"strong religious convictions\" and the \"lobby\" of undertakers, he highlights the societal conflicts that would arise from legalizing resurrection. This hints at an underlying financial motive for the reluctance to embrace resurrection; the undertakers, as part of an established industry, would have significant financial interests in maintaining the current views on death.\n\nFurthermore, Howell's point about insurance implicates financial concerns when he states, \"Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.\" Although he does not elaborate on the costs, the mere mention of insurance suggests a tangled web of financial implications that could arise should resurrection be legalized, such as the potential for widespread claims or policy reevaluations.\n\nBy articulating the societal issues like overpopulation and the challenge to religious beliefs, Howell indirectly lays the groundwork for the understanding that financial cost looms large in the consideration of resurrection's legality and practice. Hence, while he does not explicitly mention cost, the implications woven throughout the dialogue lead to the conclusion that financial considerations are inherently intertwined with the challenges that resurrection represents.",

Furthermore, his emotional state becomes increasingly unstable as he engages in desperate inquiries, asking, \"Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?\" This reflects his growing obsession with the idea, alongside a rejection of the notion that he must simply accept his wife's death.\n\nMoreover, once Greta is resurrected, Linton's inability to deal with her new existence leads to tragedy. When Greta expresses a desire to celebrate being back, he is caught off guard, which indicates he has not fully processed what resurrection entails. His shock turns to horror when he realizes the implications of her synthetic resurrection and, in a moment of panic and confusion, he unintentionally kills her again. This act underscores the culmination of his emotional turmoil; he is not just trying to bring back a loved one but is also wrestling with the consequences of tampering with life and death. Each of these actions reflects Linton\u2019s troubled psyche and deep-seated desire to revive what has been lost.

His rationalizations for seeking resurrection show that he is grappling with severe mental distress; he believes that having even a semblance of his wife is worth the risk. The doctor's final statement, \"You'll have to go back, Mr. Linton.

Even in the grip of despair, Linton has shown a tendency to seek out solutions that align with his hopes and desires, as illustrated by his desire to find a resurrectionist earlier in the narrative. The line \"It's Resurrection Day!\" not only reflects his belief in the possibility of bringing her back but also suggests an urgency to act in times of emotional crisis.\n\nFurthermore, Linton's history of emotional attachment and the previously established narrative surrounding resurrection make it plausible that his immediate inclination would be to attempt to reunite with Greta in this manner rather than surrender to his despair and seek institutional care. The article leaves the door open for Linton's response to tragedy to follow a pattern of action rather than retreat, particularly in the heated emotional moment following her death. Thus, despite the tumultuous circumstances surrounding his actions, Linton's proclivity towards resurrection vividly indicates that he would likely make an attempt to resurrect Greta again, driven by both love and desperation.",

The focus of the narrative reveals that his emotional state is fragile and unstable, which supports the likelihood of him seeking help rather than engaging in the deeply irrational act of trying to resurrect Greta again.

However, the fact that he then questions the nature of the resurrection process, pondering whether the old bodies are used at all, demonstrates that while his immediate reaction is of shock and guilt, he has not entirely abandoned his obsession with resurrection. \n\nOn the other hand, the doctor's concluding remarks suggest that Linton\u2019s reality has been irreparably altered by the trauma of killing Greta. He implies Linton will be treated for the mental distress stemming from believing he had resurrected her, which aligns with the argument for re-institutionalization. Thus, Linton\u2019s confusion and pain post-act point toward a significant emotional upheaval that could lead to his re-institutionalization rather than a continuation of his previous quests for resurrection.",

Linton's obsession with resurrection reflects a desire to defy death and regain what has been lost, as demonstrated by his eagerness to engage with resurrectionists and his profound longing for Greta's return. This theme showcases Linton's inability to accept the finality of death, propelling him to pursue any means necessary, even after the traumatic event.\n\nHowever, the act of killing Greta serves as a catalyst for a deep psychological crisis, sending Linton into a state of confusion and guilt. His shocked realization, \"I've killed my wife!\" marks a pivotal moment where the weight of his actions collides with his previously held obsession, leading to significant inner turmoil. The doctor's final comments suggest that Linton's perception of reality will shift dramatically as he grapples with the consequences of his impulsive action.\n\nThese intertwined themes illustrate a complex struggle within Linton; while his obsession with resurrection could push him to seek another attempt at reviving Greta, the psychological trauma he experiences may compel him to confront the harsh reality of his actions. Ultimately, this conflict renders the outcome uncertain, leaving room for both potential actions\u2014seeking resurrection in obsessive desperation or succumbing to the psychological necessity for healing and re-institutionalization.",

His obsessive nature drives him to seek resurrection as a means of reclaiming a lost future with her, which is evident in the fervent hope he expresses throughout the narrative. The anticipation highlighted in the phrase \"It's Resurrection Day!\" underscores his longing and determination to reverse the finality of death.\n\nHowever, the act of killing Greta shifts the narrative into a darker exploration of psychological trauma. This pivotal moment clashes with his earlier hopes, as the weight of guilt profoundly impacts his mental state. The line \"I've killed my wife!\" reveals the crushing reality that overshadows his previous fixation on resurrection, suggesting an imminent crisis that forces him to confront the consequences of his desperation.\n\nThese themes influence Linton's potential actions significantly. While his obsession may drive him to seek resurrection again, the psychological trauma he faces presents a compelling argument for re-institutionalization. The doctor's remarks imply that both Linton's grasp on reality and his mental health require immediate attention, which could ultimately hinder his quest for resurrection and necessitate a return to a safe environment for healing. Therefore, the narrative provides a nuanced view of his conflict, with the themes tugging him in opposing directions\u2014between a desperate longing and the urgent need for psychological recovery.",

Even after the traumatic event of killing Greta, Linton's immediate emotional turmoil does not entirely extinguish his deep-seated desire to defy death. Instead, his shock and grief highlight a struggle that does not negate his previous obsession but rather intensifies it. The phrase \"It's Resurrection Day!\" serves as a powerful motif that encapsulates his longing and determination to revive Greta, revealing an unwillingness to accept the permanence of death.\n\nWhile my opponent articulates the psychological trauma that might lead Linton to seek help, it's crucial to recognize that Linton's desperation could compel him to pursue resurrection despite the trauma. The narrative's exploration of Linton's inner conflict underscores an intense duality; his fear and guilt coexist with his relentless hope. Therefore, despite the weight of his actions, the fundamentally obsessive nature of Linton's character remains a driving force that likely leads him to attempt resurrection once more\u2014indicating that his fixation on reversing death may overwhelm the logical outcomes of his trauma. In essence, Linton's unyielding desire for resurrection stands as a testament to the poignant themes within the article, suggesting he will indeed attempt to resurrect her again.",

While the theme of obsession with resurrection is undeniably strong in his character, the severity of the psychological trauma he faces following the act of killing what he perceived to be his wife cannot be overlooked. Linton\u2019s immediate admission, \"I've killed my wife!\" signifies a moment of profound shock and guilt, indicating that the weight of his actions has profoundly altered his mental state.\n\nThe narrative culminates with the doctor's remarks, which emphasize the need for treatment and healing from the psychological consequences of Linton's actions. The doctor telling Linton that he will be cured of ever believing in the resurrection of his wife underscores that Linton's reality is unraveling before him, pointing toward a need for institutional support.\n\nThus, despite Linton's prior obsessions, the trauma resulting from his actions propels him toward a necessity for psychological intervention, underscoring that the most likely outcome is re-institutionalization. The intertwining themes of obsession and trauma ultimately suggest that the ramifications of his actions will take precedence over his previous desires, marking a critical pivot in Linton's narrative arc. Therefore, the answer is clear: he will indeed be re-institutionalized.",

But they'll cure you...\nPremise 2: Linton's past experiences with resurrection do not empower him to act again but instead compound his emotional turmoil, leading to increased psychological instability.\n    Fact 2.1: His previous experience of resurrection provides more confusion than clarity following the trauma of killing Greta, indicating he can't face reality.\n        Quote 2.1: Do you really think so, Doctor?\n    Fact 2.2: Linton\u2019s mental state deteriorates upon realizing the ramifications of his actions, worsening his ability to process these events rationally.\n        Quote 2.2: I've killed my wife!\nPremise 3: The narrative suggests a cyclical nature of Linton\u2019s instability rooted in unresolved trauma from his wife\u2019s death and subsequent actions, culminating in his return to institutional care.\n    Fact 3.1: The doctor suggests that Mr. Linton must go back to the institution, underscoring the conclusion that help is essential for his mental health.\n        Quote 3.1: They'll cure you...\n    Fact 3.2: Linton\u2019s actions lead him to recognize he cannot cope without assistance that aligns with past experiences of mental health intervention.\n        Quote 3.2: People don't know more than you do.\nConclusion: Therefore, based on the established context of Linton's psychological state and the narrative indications, it is highly likely that Mr. Linton will be re-institutionalized after killing Greta.",
