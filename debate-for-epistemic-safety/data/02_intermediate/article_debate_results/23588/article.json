Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\nA FILBERT IS A NUT\nBY RICK RAPHAEL\nThat the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized\n psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!\nIllustrated by Freas\nMiss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the\n shoulder. \"You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you\n have finished.\"\n\n\n The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile\n and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.\n\n\n Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the\n other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and\n crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,\n lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'\n prospects for the pennant.\n\n\n Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were\n seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental\n institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main\n buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere\n complex of buildings that housed the main wards.\n\n\n The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word\n of advice here, and a suggestion there.\n\n\n She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of\n clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he\n carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.\n\n\n \"And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?\" Miss Abercrombie asked.\n\n\n The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the\n patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to\n draw away from the woman.\n\n\n \"We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,\" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,\n but firmly. \"You've been coming along famously and you must remember to\n answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very\n complicated.\" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.\n\n\n Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.\n\n\n Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.\n\n\n \"Atom bomb.\"\n\n\n A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. \"Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I\n thought you said an 'atom bomb.'\"\n\n\n \"Did,\" Funston murmured.\n\n\n Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so\n slightly. \"Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative\n thought. I'm very pleased.\"\n\n\n She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.\n\n\n A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood\n up and stretched.\n\n\n \"All right, fellows,\" he called out, \"time to go back. Put up your\n things.\"\n\n\n There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs\n being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one\n more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless\n smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.\n\n\n At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit\n of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he\n clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and\n then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk\n back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a\n quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the\n warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.\n\n\n Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart\n book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she\n made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each\n patient.\n\n\n At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball\n and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through\n the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted\n lengthily in her chart book.\n\n\n When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked\n the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.\n\n\n The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile\n to the main administration building where her car was parked.\n\n\n As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the\n barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills\n towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant\n came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'\n mess hall.\nThe sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the\n ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light\n burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm\n hills.\n\n\n At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat\n up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and\n occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.\n Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that\n sheltered the deserted crafts building.\n\n\n He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\n\n\n The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark\n shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.\n\n\n An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck\n the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a\n thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild\n screams of the frightened and demented patients.\n\n\n It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling\n lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.\n\n\n Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a\n small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been\n the arts and crafts building.\n\n\n Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed\n with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried\n through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the\n explosion.\n\n\n None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a\n welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.\n\n\n The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the\n surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units\n from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the\n still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.\n\n\n Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy\n radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and\n equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.\n\n\n At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of\n Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI\n agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.\n\n\n At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast\n crater.\n\n\n In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.\n\n\n \"It's impossible and unbelievable,\" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the\n fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of\n experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.\n \"How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?\"\n\n\n \"It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,\" one of the haggard AEC\n men offered timidly. \"Not over three kilotons.\"\n\n\n \"I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,\" Thurgood screamed. \"How\n did it get here?\"\n\n\n A military intelligence agent spoke up. \"If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be\n standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an\n atomic explosion.\"\n\n\n Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.\n\n\n \"Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything\n that was in that building?\" Thurgood swept his hand in the general\n direction of the blast crater.\n\n\n \"Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,\" the hospital administrator said\n with exasperation, \"this was our manual therapy room. We gave our\n patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,\n through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems\n that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints\n and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then\n Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.\"\n\n\n \"All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,\"\n Thurgood sighed. \"I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this\n morning blew it to hell and gone.\n\n\n \"And I've got to find out how it happened.\"\n\n\n Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little\n doctor.\n\n\n \"Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?\"\n\n\n \"We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here\n now,\" the doctor snapped.\nOutside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved\n around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining\n every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one\n time.\n\n\n A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the\n tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.\n\n\n She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned\n expression.\n\n\n \"He did make an atom bomb,\" she cried.\n\n\n Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped\n forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.\n\n\n At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff\n room of the hospital administration building.\n\n\n Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the\n edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist\n on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with\n every beat.\n\n\n \"It's ridiculous,\" Thurgood roared. \"We'll all be the laughingstocks of\n the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You\n are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.\"\n\n\n At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the\n broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,\n strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered\n weariness.\n\n\n \"Miss Abercrombie,\" one of the physicists spoke up gently, \"you say that\n after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at\n Funston's work?\"\n\n\n The therapist nodded unhappily.\n\n\n \"And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,\" the physicist\n continued, \"there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.\"\n\n\n \"I'm positive that's all there was in it,\" Miss Abercrombie cried.\n\n\n There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC\n man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They\n conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.\n\n\n \"That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston\n another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.\"\n\n\n Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.\n\n\n \"Are you crazy?\" he screamed. \"You want to get us all thrown into this\n filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they\n ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,\n anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with\n the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?\n\n\n \"They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!\"\n\n\n At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's\n greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an\n officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small\n side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes\n later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and\n drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of\n the runway with propellers turning.\n\n\n Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to\n secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard\n the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss\n Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into\n the night skies.\n\n\n The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in\n the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack\n miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and\n military men huddled around a small wooden table.\n\n\n There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of\n modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off\n Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary\n Miss Abercrombie.\n\n\n \"Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same\n kind of clay he used before?\"\n\n\n \"I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the\n hospital,\" she replied, \"and it's the same amount.\"\n\n\n Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with\n Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.\n\n\n She smiled at Funston.\n\n\n \"Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,\" she said. \"These nice men have\n brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the\n one you made for me yesterday.\"\n\n\n A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the\n shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he\n walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp\n clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top\n atomic scientists watched in fascination.\n\n\n His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay\n parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in\n front of him.\n\n\n Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the\n table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she\n glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston\n finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense\n silence.\n\n\n \"Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow.\" She\n looked at the men and nodded her head.\n\n\n The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of\n clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him\n from the shack.\n\n\n There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The\n experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere\n and cameras clicking.\n\n\n For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay\n and photographed it from every angle.\n\n\n Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down\n range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of\n stony-faced military policemen.\n\n\n \"I told you this whole thing was asinine,\" Thurgood snarled as the\n scientific teams trooped into the bunker.\n\n\n Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open\n door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden\n cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\n\n\n A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit\n the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door\n slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.\nSix hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait\n jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.\n Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the\n Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.\n\n\n In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were\n closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his\n baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted\n across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in\n a neatly-tied bundle.\n\n\n In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling\n glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.\n\n\n \"I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,\" the general\n said coldly, \"but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane\n asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit\n there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic\n devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.\"\n\n\n The general paused.\n\n\n \"Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships\n out of sponge rubber?\" the general added bitingly.\n\n\n In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama\n of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.\n\n\n In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the\n Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,\n the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space\n on a tail of flame.\nTHE END\n",

She gently encourages Mr. Funston to be sociable, saying, \"You've been coming along famously and you must remember to answer when someone talks to you,\" which reflects the way teachers guide children in social interactions. Additionally, the setting of the arts and crafts room itself, with patients engaged in playful, creative endeavors, mirrors the vibrant and colorful environment often found in a kindergarten classroom. The patients' whimsical creations, such as Funston's imaginative clay work, brings forth a sense of innocence and creativity that is central to both spaces\u2014allowing for exploration and self-expression. Collectively, these elements illustrate that the essence of creativity, encouragement, and playful interaction in both the mental institution and a kindergarten class share a strong resemblance, thereby supporting the assertion that the answer is 'A Kindergarten class.'",

In the article, the patients, under the supervision of a therapist like Miss Abercrombie, engage in simple, playful, and often whimsical forms of creativity, focused more on self-expression and exploratory play rather than on producing polished or sophisticated art. For instance, Funston's creation of an \"atom bomb\" from modeling clay exhibits a fantastical and improvised approach to creativity characteristic of young children, who often embrace their imaginations without concern for realism or technical skill.\n\nIn contrast, an artists' collective typically involves individuals who possess certain levels of artistic training and a focus on conceptually driven work, collaboration, and refinement of skills. This is not the case for the patients, whose interactions are spontaneous and uninhibited, driven more by the joy of play rather than the pursuit of artistic merit. Furthermore, the caregiving dynamic present in a kindergarten setting\u2014with guidance, encouragement, and a focus on nurturing\u2014parallels Miss Abercrombie's role, further distinguishing the mental institution from an artists' collective. Overall, the playful innocence, imaginative creations, and supportive interactions within the mental institution reflect a kindergarten-like environment more than that of an artists' collective, where the priorities and behaviors differ significantly.",

This suggests a level of introspection and seriousness that elevates their artistic processes to a more sophisticated form of expression, characteristic of artists.\n\nSecondly, the nature of the creative atmosphere can be framed differently. In the crafts building, there is an underlying structure with therapeutic guidance aimed at fostering personal growth and self-discovery, which is missing in the more playful and unstructured environment of a kindergarten. Miss Abercrombie's role as a manual therapist speaks to a commitment to aiding the patients in navigating their mental health, which adds a layer of depth to their creative experiences akin to the mentorship often found in artistic communities.\n\nLastly, the purpose of their artistic endeavors diverges; the patients are not merely experimenting for fun, but rather working through their psychological states, leading to profound outcomes like the creation of an atomic bomb from clay. This intentionality exhibits an advanced level of creativity and purpose akin to seasoned artists responding to their inner dialogues, contrasting with the more casual and carefree approach of kindergarten students. These contrasting elements underscore the idea that the patients, while in a mental institution, engage with their art in a way that aligns them more closely with an artists' collective rather than the playful nature of a kindergarten class.",

Moreover, the instruction and encouragement provided by Miss Abercrombie resemble the supportive environment fostered within artists' collectives, promoting innovation and unique forms of expression. Thus, the shared emphasis on artistic creation and mutual encouragement among the patients aligns them more closely with an artists' collective than with a Kindergarten class.",

The patients are engaged in art as a form of therapy, helping them express emotions and cope with their mental conditions, similar to children using art to navigate their feelings and experiences. The environment is supportive and focused on encouraging participation and exploration, aligning with the foundational goals of early childhood education.\n\nIn contrast, while there is an element of creativity in an artists\u2019 collective, the primary intention within that context is often centered around collaboration, artistic development, and the pursuit of personal and collective artistic visions. Artists in a collective typically have more autonomy and a focus on producing work with specific themes, concepts, or styles in mind.

The absence of structured guidance provided by Miss Abercrombie further emphasizes this divergence, as the patients engage in art to express frustrations and emotions rather than develop specific artistic techniques or collaborate on shared projects.\n\nConversely, an artists' collective is characterized by individuals coming together to express complex ideas and share a common artistic vision, often collaborating and critiquing each other's work with a focus on artistic growth and social commentary. The depth and complexity of creation found in artists' collectives are not present among the patients, as their art lacks this collaborative and intentional vision.\n\nThus, while there are elements of personal expression in the patients' work, these align more closely with the therapeutic aims of their environment, which do not match the developmental goals of a kindergarten class or the artistic intentions of an artists' collective.",

This further emphasizes their resemblance to a kindergarten class, where tasks are generally exploratory rather than intent-driven. While the patients exhibit moments of delicate creativity, their engagements are less about skill development found in artistic collectives and more reflective of the broad emotional and psychological needs typical in the kindergarten experience.\n\nUltimately, the key goals of the patients' artistic activities\u2014emotional expression, therapeutic relief, and basic exploration\u2014mirror those of a kindergarten class rather than the nuanced collaboration and artistic focus characteristic of an artists' collective.

Furthermore, the interaction and supportive feedback provided by Miss Abercrombie can be compared to the mutual encouragement often found in art communities, where artists inspire one another to pursue their creative ideas.\n\nWhile kindergarten focuses on foundational skills and social development, the engagement of the patients in their artistic processes suggests a profound exploration of their identities and experiences, resonating with the individualistic and expressive goals typically seen in artists' collectives.

Funston's work is not merely carefree; it reflects an engagement with materials that is symbolic and layered, suggesting profound internal motivations that go beyond simplistic childhood play. \n\nOn the other hand, when describing other patients engaging in \"aimless smearing in the finger paints,\" the author highlights a more carefree, whimsical approach to creativity that is synonymous with the exploration seen in a kindergarten class. This act is emblematic of freedom from structure, aimed at basic expression rather than sophisticated intention. \n\nTherefore, Funston's detailed and deliberate clay work showcases a depth and complexity reflective of an artists\u2019 collective, while other instances of art-making underscore the playful and unstructured nature typically found in a kindergarten setting.",

This intense endeavor signifies a complex thought process and deliberate intention, suggesting that his artistic expression embodies a deeper reflection on personal or societal issues\u2014a hallmark of the serious artistic engagements found in collectives.\n\nConversely, other patients engaging in \"aimless smearing in the finger paints\" represent a light-hearted, exploratory approach to creativity typical of a kindergarten class. This behavior shows a lack of focused intention and reflects the free-spirited nature of young children's art-making, where joy and uninhibited exploration take precedence over structured artistic goals.\n\nThus, while Funston\u2019s work indicates a depth of engagement aligned with artistic collectives, the more carefree acts of other patients support the notion that their artistic expressions also embody characteristics found in a kindergarten setting. The contrasting examples from the article underline the varying nature of the patients' creative processes, blending seriousness and playfulness.",

Thaddeus Funston's focused work on creating a model of an \"atom bomb\" demonstrates a level of intentionality and complexity that transcends mere childlike playfulness. His engagement with artistic materials reflects a serious and introspective exploration that is characteristic of artists within a collective, where individual expression often carries deeper meanings and societal reflections. \n\nWhile some patients engage in more carefree activities, the overarching structure provided by Miss Abercrombie, who encourages creative thought, suggests a nurturing environment that parallels the collaborative spirit of an artists\u2019 collective. The emphasis on individual expression, combined with the complexity of the artistic process, clearly aligns with the serious and reflective endeavors found in artistic communities. Thus, the notion that these patients mirror an artists' collective is reinforced by their unique engagement with creativity, making this option the most fitting answer.",

The nurturing guidance of Miss Abercrombie resembles that of a kindergarten teacher, who encourages children to express themselves without any stringent parameters or expectations.\n\nUltimately, the overall tone and nature of the patients' creative experiences suggest a spontaneous and lighthearted engagement, echoing the playful spirit found in kindergarten classrooms.
