    "article": "A PLANET NAMED JOE\nBy S. A. LOMBINO\nThere were more Joes on Venus than you could shake\n \na ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel\n \nWalsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major\n \nPolk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\n\n November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\n\n U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nColonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\n we went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n\n\n For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\n He might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\n I liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\n least, that's what he told me.\n\n\n I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\n somewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\n Space II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\n it, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\n then. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\n by with gravy.\n\n\n \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\n his fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\n \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n\n\n I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on\n the job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\n fingers.\n\n\n \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\n added, \"For a native, that is.\"\n\n\n I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the\n way he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.\n Which brought to mind an important point.\n\n\n \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\n thought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n\n\n He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\n as if he were waiting for me to cut.\n\n\n \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so\n happens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\n what's happening on Mars.\"\n\n\n I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very\n far.\n\n\n \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\n anyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n\n\n If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\n them to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\n it \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at\n least a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n\n\n \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never\n been to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It\n was just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n\n\n \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n\n\n At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported\n him for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\n that could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\n He still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\n reporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\n any military organization, he outranked me.\n\n\n \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n\n\n \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Just Joe.\"\n\n\n \"Just Joe?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\n first names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\n like Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n\n\n \"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n\n\n \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\n Personal habits? Anything?\"\n\n\n Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\n any of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\n does have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n\n\n \"What's that?\"\n\n\n \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n\n\n I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n\n\n \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\nThe trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on\n that trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought\n about Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that\n revolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started\n pushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if\n the whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took\n over. Swell guy, Walsh.\n\n\n Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic\n I was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like\n a mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere\n I looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd\n never seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\n\n\n I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me\n about. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about\n him was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have\n been stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to\n normal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\n\n\n I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\n\n\n He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance\n between us in seconds.\n\n\n \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\n\n\n I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this\nwas\ngoing to be a\n simple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\n\n\n \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told\n him.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at\n his use of Terran idiom.\n\n\n \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\"\n\n\n \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a\n pocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began\n wondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking\n for. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately\n upon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him\n anyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a\n drink first.\n\n\n \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\n\n\n \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\n\n\n \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a\n heavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when\n he dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\n\n\n The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that\n protected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable\n but I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped\n the native thirty solars.\n\n\n He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh\n well, you're new here. We'll let it go.\"\n\n\n He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd\n meant. Had I tipped him too little?\n\n\n I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it\n looked as hot as hell.\n\n\n On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to\n curse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\n\n\n There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game\n and a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\n\n\n I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\n\n\n \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\n\n\n He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Joe,\" he said again.\n\n\n A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\n \"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about\n Mars, would you?\"\n\n\n \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\n\n\n That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\nBut then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like\nJoe.\nAmong the natives, I mean.\nSure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most\n contemptible....\n\n\n \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\n\n\n \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\"\n\n\n \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\"\n\n\n I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at\n the bartender.\n\n\n \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n\n\n \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\n\n\n I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a\n great gag. Very funny. Very....\n\n\n \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\n\n\n \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's\n about ready to post you as overdue.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\n\n\n \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\n\n\n \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\n\n\n \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back.\nCaptain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\n a tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\n an officer.\n\n\n \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\n desk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\n was empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\n open. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n\n\n \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n\n\n \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\n some, please?\"\n\n\n \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\n door behind him.\nAnother Joe\n, I thought.\nAnother damned Joe.\n\"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n\n\n \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\n they like about Terran culture.\"\n\n\n So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\nHe does have a peculiar\n habit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\nCigarettes\n was the tip I should have given; not solars.\n\n\n \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n\n\n Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\n I think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n\n\n Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\n was so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\n waited for his explanation.\n\n\n \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\n know. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n\n\n \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n\n\n \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\n Lots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n\n\n I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\n ancestry more keenly.\n\n\n \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\n Bransten was saying.\n\n\n I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\n sitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n\n\n \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n\n\n \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\n wasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\n they are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\n Joe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\n like to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n\n\n \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n\n\n \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\n are a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\n business, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\n cigarettes.\"\n\n\n He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\n personally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\n he were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\n place.\n\n\n \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n\n\n Just a case of extended\nidiot\n, I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\n chase a hell of a long way from home.\n\n\n \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n\n\n Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\n me that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\n Venusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n\n\n I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\n stuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\n tunic.\n\n\n I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\n of thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\n twinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n\n\n Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\n pussy cat.\n\n\n \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n\n\n Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\n difficulties, are you?\"\n\n\n \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\n a lot sooner if....\"\n\n\n \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n\n\n \"I thought....\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\n otherwise.\"\n\n\n Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n\n\n \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n\n\n I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\n big white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\n surprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\n away.\n\n\n He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\n him.\n\n\n \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n\n\n I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\n on my end went blank, too.\nHe's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\nI thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\n quarters.\n\n\n As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n\n\n One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\n the next ship back to Earth.\n\n\n It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\n It might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\n Service altogether.\n\n\n Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\n jungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\n trader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\n course, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\n really find a guy who was trader Joe.\n\n\n I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\n besides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\n life. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\n was I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n\n\n I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n\n\n A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n\n\n \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n\n\n \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n\n\n \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\n into the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n\n\n \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n\n\n \"How much?\"\n\n\n \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n\n\n \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"How's the price sound?\"\n\n\n \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\n almost a childish people!\n\n\n \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\n planet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\n Courageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n\n\n \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\n around fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n\n\n The Venusian started to leave.\n\n\n \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\n overlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n\n\n His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n\n\n When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\n just have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\n a planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\n Captain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\nI began wondering why Walsh had gone to so much trouble to get rid of\n me. The job, as I saw it, would take a hell of a long time. It seemed\n like a silly thing to do, just to get even with a guy for something\n that had happened years ago. He surely must have realized that I'd be\n back again, sooner or later. Maybe he had another little junket all set\n for me.\n\n\n Or maybe he didn't expect me to come back.\n\n\n The thought hadn't occurred to me before this, and I began to consider\n it seriously. Walsh was no good, rotten clear through. He was failing\n at the job of keeping Mars in hand, and he probably realized that a\n few more mistakes on his part would mean the end of his career with\n Space II. I chuckled as I thought of him isolated in some God-forsaken\n place like Space V or Space VII. This probably bothered him a lot, too.\n But what probably bothered him more was the fact that I was next in\n command. If he were transferred, I'd be in charge of Space II, and I\n could understand how much that would appeal to Walsh.\n\n\n I tried to figure the thing out sensibly, tried to weigh his good\n points against his bad. But it all came back to the same thing. A\n guy who would deliberately go to sleep on Boiler Watch with a ton of\n uranium ready to blast a barracks to smithereens if it wasn't watched,\n would deliberately do just about anything.\n\n\n Sending me off on a wild goose chase after a character named Joe may\n have been a gag. But it may have been something a little grimmer than a\n gag, and I made up my mind to be extremely careful from here on in.\n\n\n The guide arrived at fifteen hundred on the dot. He was tall,\n elongated, looked almost like all the other Venusians I'd seen so far.\n\n\n \"I understand you need a Grade A guide, sir,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Are you familiar with the jungle?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Born and raised there, sir. Know it like the back of my hand.\"\n\n\n \"Has Joe told you what the payment will be?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. A carton and a half of cigarettes.\"\n\n\n I thought about Joe deducting his commission and smiled.\n\n\n \"When can we leave?\"\n\n\n \"Right away, sir. We won't need much really. I've made a list of\n supplies and I can get them in less than an hour. I suggest you wear\n light clothing, boots, and a hat.\"\n\n\n \"Will I need a weapon?\"\n\n\n He looked at me, his eyes faintly amused. \"Why, what for, sir?\"\n\n\n \"Never mind,\" I said. \"What's your name, by the way?\"\n\n\n He lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes widened in his narrow face. He was\n definitely surprised.\n\n\n \"Joe,\" he said. \"Didn't you know?\"\nWhen we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\n boots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\n would have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\n high boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n\n\n Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\n enjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\n pleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\n see three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\n his head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\n Then he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\n impenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\n to another village.\n\n\n Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\n huts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\n me a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n\n\n Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\n stinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\n I any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\n about the whole affair.\n\n\n Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\n village he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\n gossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\n to all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n\n\n His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\n that would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\n would talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n\n\n \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n\n\n \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\n for Venus. And they are fun.\"\n\n\n \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\n Leonard Walsh.\n\n\n \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\n well, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n\n\n Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\n that I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\n just my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\n employee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\n began to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\n the people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\n tests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\n sympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n\n\n And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\n friendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\n grinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n\n\n Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\n greenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\n gleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\n vines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\n through them like strips of silk.\n\n\n \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n\n\n I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n\n\n \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n\n\n \"We'll never find him.\"\n\n\n \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n\n\n \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n\n\n \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n\n\n I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\n brilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\n feeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\n friends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\n own house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\n reminded me of that friend.\n\n\n \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\n now, his eyes shining.\nSomething was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\n to greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n\n\n \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n\n\n He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n\n\n And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\n the sun like a great silver bullet.\n\n\n \"What...?\" I started.\n\n\n \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n\n\n The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\n the nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\n standing near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n\n\n \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\n cheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n\n\n \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\n joviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n\n\n Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\n happiness.\n\n\n \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n\n\n I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\n was getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n\n\n I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n\n\n \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\nMajor\n.\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\n finality.\n\n\n I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\n been. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\n pointing the stun gun at my middle.\n\n\n \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n\n\n \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\n have.\"\n\n\n Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\n smile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\n going to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\n it'll rain tomorrow.\"\n\n\n Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\n this. Another of those funny Terran games.\n\n\n \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\n should thank you, really.\"\n\n\n \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n\n\n \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n\n\n \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\n when you decided to cork off.\"\n\n\n Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n\n\n \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n\n\n \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\n nudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\n sometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n\n\n Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\n audible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\n little spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\n unimportant drama.\n\n\n I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n\n\n \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n\n\n \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n\n\n \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n\n\n Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\n understand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\n game, the fun?\n\n\n \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\n never any trouble before you took command.\"\n\n\n \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n\n\n Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\n say about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\n Or maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n\n\n \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n\n\n \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\n savages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\n The perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\n colonel in puzzlement.\n",

Additionally, Polk suspects that Walsh's intentions could be revenge-driven, reinforcing that this mission serves to retaliate for the past report. The absence of any indication that Walsh would have voluntarily selected Polk for a challenging task without the animosity underlying their history further supports this argument.

This hatred is reciprocated by Walsh, who assignments Polk to a difficult and unwelcome mission as a form of punishment, indicating that he relishes the opportunity to assert his superiority over Polk as a means of retaliation.\n\nMoreover, when Polk questions Walsh about the assignment, he reflects on Walsh's attitude, saying, \u201cIf Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give them to him in one word: Walsh.\u201d This sentiment demonstrates not only Polk\u2019s anger but also his realization that Walsh's poor leadership is the root cause of the turmoil they are dealing with. They share a relationship fraught with tension and conflict, characterized by mutual contempt.\n\nThroughout the story, their interactions are laced with Polk's resentment and Walsh's condescending demeanor, showcasing their ongoing struggle for power and respect. For example, Walsh's sarcastic affirmation that he chose Polk for the assignment out of a sense of humor\u2014\u201cHe liked me about as much as I liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major\u201d\u2014encapsulates the extent of their antagonism.\n\nOverall, the Boiler Watch incident not only served as a turning point in their relationship but also colored each interaction moving forward, leading to a mission fueled by underlying grudges and a desire for vengeance. Thus, it is evident how deeply the past incident shaped their dynamic throughout the narrative.",

For instance, they might have approached joint operations on Mars or Venus as a team, leveraging their respective strengths to address the revolt rather than perpetuating a cycle of resentment and sabotage.

Had their relationship been collegial, they could have potentially worked together to unify their strategies and address the complexities of interplanetary relations with the natives. However, Walsh's persistent need to undermine Polk and the way Walsh revels in assigning him impossible tasks\u2014exemplified by sending him on a wild goose chase for a man named Joe\u2014forces Polk into a defensive position.

Revolt.\" This indicates not only a lack of trust in Walsh's authority but also a willingness to challenge his directives, which undermines the chain of command necessary for effective cooperation.\n\nMoreover, when Polk seeks additional information about Joe, Walsh is nonchalant, providing minimal details and reinforcing Polk's frustration and helplessness by stating, \"You'll find him,\" without offering any substantial guidance. This highlights Walsh's disinterest in truly facilitating Polk's mission, emphasizing that their communication is more of a taunt than a collaborative effort.\n\nAdditionally, during their interaction, Polk's irritation and resentment are palpable when he reflects on Walsh's tendency to dismiss his concerns, leading to a complete breakdown in their working relationship. By cutting off communication with Walsh after expressing his disdain, Polk also signals his reluctance to engage cooperatively: \"I wanted to ram my fist into the screen.\" \n\nThese examples illustrate that their past conflict has not only created hostility but actively obstructs any meaningful dialogue or collaboration, resulting in Polk having to navigate challenges independently while consistently reflecting on how Walsh's behavior exacerbates the situation.

Major Polk himself reflects on their history, noting, \u201cI had never liked Walsh\u2019s attitude toward natives\u201d and his disdain for Walsh's disdainful behavior.

The article solidly establishes that their dynamic is shaped significantly by this past grievance, leading to Walsh's manipulative behavior and punitive measures against Polk. Walsh's need for control is illustrated throughout the piece, exemplified when he assigns Polk the mission with an air of mockery, labeling it a \"simple assignment.\" This suggests that his decision to send Polk is directly influenced by their history, making it unlikely that he would have offered Polk such an assignment had the reporting incident not occurred.\n\nWhile it's true that both characters possess personality traits that could lead to tension, the absence of the specific incident removes the catalyst for Walsh's vindictiveness. It is evident from the text that Walsh\u2019s actions are rooted in revenge, inflected by the shame of being reported. Thus, in a scenario without that incident, Walsh would have lacked a personal motivation to undermine Polk, allowing for a potential working relationship based on professionalism rather than conflict. Consequently, had Major Polk never reported Walsh, Captain Walsh would not have had the vindictive impulse that leads him to send Polk on the troublesome mission, further supporting the assertion that he would never have assigned Polk to find \"Joe.\"",

The history of animosity stemming from Walsh's disgrace leads to a power struggle and a manipulative dynamic that defines their interactions. The article emphasizes that Walsh's decision to send Polk on the convoluted mission to find \"Joe\" is fueled by personal vendetta, as shown by his dismissive remarks and the way he treats the assignment as trivial despite its gravity. Without the reporting incident, the foundation of their tumultuous relationship would not exist, allowing for a potential evolution towards a more collaborative approach. While their personalities indicate a tendency toward conflict, the absence of the grievance creates a scenario where their interactions could pivot towards mutual respect and action in unison rather than hostility. Thus, the lack of the pivotal incident would imply that Major Polk and Captain Walsh would not have worked together in the same contentious manner, reinforcing the idea that they would have a completely different working relationship, free from the undercurrent of resentment that currently prevails.",
