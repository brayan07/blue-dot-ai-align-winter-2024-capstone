    "article": "THE AVENGER\nBy STUART FLEMING\nKarson was creating a superman to fight the weird\n\n super-monsters who had invaded Earth. But he was\n\n forgetting one tiny thing\u2014like calls to like.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nPeter Karson was dead. He had been dead for some time now, but\n the dark blood was still oozing from the crushed ruin of his face,\n trickling down into his sodden sleeve, and falling, drop by slow drop,\n from his fingertips. His head was tilted over the back of the chair at\n a queer, unnatural angle, so that the light made deep pools of shadow\n where his eyes had been.\nThere was no sound in the room except for the small splashing the\n blood made as it dropped into the sticky pool on the floor. The great\n banks of machinery around the walls were silent. I knew that they would\n never come to life again.\nI rose and walked over to the window. Outside, the stars were as\n before: tiny, myriad points of light, infinitely far away. They had not\n changed, and yet they were suddenly no longer friendly. They were cold\n and alien. It was I who had changed: something inside me was dead, like\n the machinery, and like Peter.\nIt was a kind of indefinable emptiness. I do not think it was what\n Peter called an emotion; and yet it had nothing to do with logic,\n either. It was just an emptiness\u2014a void that could not be filled by\n eating or drinking.\nIt was not a longing. I had no desire that things should be otherwise\n than they were. I did not even wish that Peter were not dead, for\n reason had told me that he had to die. That was the end of it.\nBut the void was still there, unexplainable and impossible to ignore.\n For the first time in all my life I had found a problem that I could\n not solve. Strange, disturbing sensations stirred and whispered within\n me, nagging, gnawing. And suddenly\u2014something moved on the skin of my\n cheek. I raised a hand to it, slowly.\nA tear was trickling down my cheek.\nYoung Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\n satisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\nCitadel\nwas complete, every\n minutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\n laying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\n glittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\n finished, a living thing.\n\n\n Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\n ship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\n In his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\n satellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\n insatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\n laboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\n meteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\n stern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n\n\n Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\n atmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\n a laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\n the sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\n ether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n\n\n A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\n of the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\n that thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\n as if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\n back.\n\n\n There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\n impassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\n face, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\n blood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\n body.\n\n\n For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\n eyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\n slowly away and was gone.\n\n\n \"Lord!\" he said.\n\n\n He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\n somewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\n moment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\n was normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\n world had grown suddenly unreal.\n\n\n One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\n from the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\n other part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\n It considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\n decided that this was probable.\n\n\n Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\n were shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\n newsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n\n\n There were flaring red headlines.\n\n\n Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\n of course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\n glad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\n terrible illusion.\nINVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n\n 200 DEAD\n\n\n Then lines of type, and farther down:\n50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n\n PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n\n\n He pressed the stud. The roll was full of them.\nMOON SHIP DESTROYED\n\n IN TRANSIT\n\n NO COMMUNICATION FROM\n\n ANTARCTICA IN 6 HOURS\n\n STRANGE FORCE DEFLECTS\n\n PLANES FROM SAHARA AREA\n\n WORLD POLICE MOBILIZING\n\n\n The item below the last one said:\n\n\n Pacifica, June 7\u2014The World Police are mobilizing, for the first time\n in fifty years. The order was made public early this morning by\n R. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n\n\n \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\n peoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\n depredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\n London; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\n and in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\n reports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\n have not seen them.\n\n\n \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\n we face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\nsuperior to ourselves in every way\n.\n\n\n \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\n ago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\n in any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\n have treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\n have treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\n attacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\n nor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\n have done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\n driven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\n more intolerable than any normal invasion.\n\n\n \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\n challenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\n are threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\n the Invaders!\"\n\n\n Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\n first time.\n\n\n \"\nWill\nwe?\" he asked himself softly.\nIt was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\n laboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\n a halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\n mechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\n He mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\n in the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\n far enough to admit him.\n\n\n Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\n on her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\n blonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n\n\n \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\n Then she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n \"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n\n\n He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n\n\n She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\n hours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n\n\n \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n\n\n She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\n you know I haven't one\u2014it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\n there's trouble or not. What\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n\n\n She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\n walked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\n papers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\n and pressed the stud.\n\n\n A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\n suddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n\n\n Lorelei caught her breath.\n\n\n It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\n the warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\n transport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\n been dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\n yes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\n disappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\n heartbeat they were gone.\n\n\n There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\n defiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\n flesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\n men and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\n joined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\n helpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\n horrible than any cry of agony.\n\n\n \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\n strangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\n streets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\nLorelei buried her head on his chest, clutching at him desperately.\n \"Peter!\" she said faintly. \"Why do they broadcast such things?\"\n\n\n \"They have to,\" he told her grimly. \"There will be panics and suicides,\n and they know it; but they have to do it. This isn't like a war, where\n the noncombatants' morale has to be kept up. There aren't going to be\n any noncombatants, this time. Everybody in the world has to know about\n them, so that he can fight them\u2014and then it may not be enough.\"\n\n\n The viewpoint of the teleo sender changed as the two red beings soared\n away from their victims and angled slowly up the street. Peter reached\n out to switch off the scanner, and froze. The girl felt his muscles\n tense abruptly, looked back at the scene. The Invaders were floating\n up the sloping side of a tall, pure white structure that dominated the\n rest.\n\n\n \"That's the Atlas building,\" she said unbelievingly. \"Us!\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n Silently, they counted stories as the two beings rose. Forty-five ...\n forty-six ... forty-seven ... forty-eight. Inevitably, they halted.\n Then they faded slowly. It was impossible to say whether they had gone\n through the solid wall, or simply melted away.\n\n\n The man and woman clung together, waiting.\n\n\n There was a thick, oppressive silence, full of small rustlings and\n other faint sounds that were no longer normal. Then, very near, a man\n screamed in a high, inhuman voice. The screamed dwindled into a throaty\n gurgle and died, leaving silence again.\n\n\n Peter's lips were cold with sweat. Tiny nerves in his face and arms\n were jumping convulsively. His stomach crawled. He thrust the girl away\n from him and started toward the inner room.\n\n\n \"Wait here,\" he mouthed.\n\n\n She was after him, clinging to his arms. \"No, Peter! Don't go in there!\nPeter!\n\" But he pushed her away again, woodenly, and stalked forward.\n\n\n There was a space in the middle of the room where machinery had been\n cleared away to make room for an incompleted setup. Peter walked down\n the narrow aisle, past bakelite-sheathed mechanisms and rows of animal\n cages, and paused just short of it.\n\n\n The two red beings were there, formless bodies hazy in midair, the\n distorted, hairless skulls in profile, staring at something outside his\n range of vision.\nPeter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\n Lorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\n broad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\n glazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\n straight ahead of him.\n\n\n The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\n In a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\n paralyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n\n\n The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\n relaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\n legs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\n grew gradually flatter.\n\n\n When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\n puddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n\n\n There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\n fear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\n in a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n\n\n The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\n but there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n\n\n The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n\n\n \"\nWurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\n\"\n\n\n The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\n ears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\n seemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\n were lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\n the eyes were alive.\n\n\n \"\n... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\n\"\n\n\n \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"\n... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\n\"\n\n\n He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\n time he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\n swaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\n slowly....\n\n\n \"\nOpreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\n\"\n\n\n His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't\u2014Go back!\" The horrible,\n mindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\n His insides writhed to thrust it out.\n\n\n She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\n floor.\n\n\n The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\n it back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\n fingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\n the room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\nSomebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n\n\n He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei\u2014\" but his mouth only\n twitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.\n\n\n He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\n\n\n \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\n\n\n He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;\n in a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\n oddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\n starched odor.\n\n\n \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\n pressed him back into the sheets.\n\n\n \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n\n\n He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n\n\n \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a\n very sick man.\"\n\n\n Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\n around him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n\n\n \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n\n\n The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\n turned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n\n\n Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\n stand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\n milky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n\n\n In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\n before he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't\u2014fool me. It's been\nmore\n\u2014than three\u2014months.\"\n\n\n He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\n kept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\n out of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd\n been in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\n sooner.\n\n\n \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n \"Seeing that assistant of hers\u2014it was enough to knock anybody out,\n especially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\nthem\nfor approximately five minutes. Yes, we know\u2014you talked a lot. It's a\n miracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n\n\n \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why\n I haven't been able to see her.\"\n\n\n Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to\n take it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,\n and a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,\n as soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in six\n months ago.\"\n\n\n \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\n\n\n Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else\n has failed.\"\n\n\n Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on\n after a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\n It didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\n even take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\n when a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\n one time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\n didn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd\n been annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still\n smoldering.\"\n\n\n \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\n\n\n \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be\n an impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated\n areas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate\n enough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other\n three-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\n\n\n \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\n\n\n Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our\n last hope, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Our last hope?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. You're a scientist.\"\n\n\n \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the\nCitadel\n. No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,\nmaybe\n, he\n thought,\nthere's a chance\n....\nIt wasn't very big, the thing that had been his shining dream. It lay\n there in its rough cradle, a globe of raw dura-steel not more than\n five hundred meters in diameter, where the\nCitadel\nwas to have been a\n thousand. It wouldn't house a hundred scientists, eagerly delving into\n the hinterland of research. The huge compartments weren't filled with\n the latest equipment for chemical and physical experiment; instead,\n there was compressed oxygen there, and concentrated food, enough to\n last a lifetime.\n\n\n It was a new world, all by itself; or else it was a tomb. And there was\n one other change, one that you couldn't see from the outside. The solid\n meters of lead in its outer skin, the shielding to keep out cosmic\n rays, were gone.\n\n\n A man had just finished engraving the final stroke on its nameplate, to\n the left of the airlock\u2014\nThe Avenger\n. He stepped away now, and joined\n the group a little distance away, silently waiting.\n\n\n Lorelei said, \"You can't do it. I won't let you! Peter\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Darling,\" he began wearily.\n\n\n \"Don't throw your life away! Give us time\u2014there must be another way.\"\n\n\n \"There's no other way,\" Peter said. He gripped her arms tightly, as if\n he could compel her to understand by the sheer pressure of his fingers.\n \"Darling, listen to me. We've tried everything. We've gone underground,\n but that's only delaying the end.\nThey\nstill come down here, only not\n as many. The mortality rate is up, the suicide rate is up, the birth\n rate is down, in spite of anything we can do. You've seen the figures:\n we're riding a curve that ends in extinction fifty years from now.\n\n\n \"They'll live, and we'll die, because they're a superior race. We're a\n million years too far back even to understand what they are or where\n they came from. Besides them, we're apes. There's only one answer.\"\n\n\n She was crying now, silently, with great racking sobs that shook her\n slender body. But he went remorselessly on.\n\n\n \"Out there, in space, the cosmics change unshielded life. They\n make tentacles out of arms; or scales out of hair; or twelve toes,\n or a dozen ears\u2014or a better brain. Out of those millions of\n possible mutations, there's one that will save the human race. We\n can't fight\nthem\n, but a superman could. That's our only chance.\n Lorelei\u2014darling\u2014don't you see that?\"\n\n\n She choked, \"But why can't you take me along?\"\n\n\n He stared unseeingly past her wet, upturned face. \"You know why,\" he\n said bitterly. \"Those rays are strong. They don't only work on embryos;\n they change adult life forms, too. I have one chance in seven of\n staying alive. You'd have one chance in a million of staying beautiful.\n I couldn't stand that. I'd kill myself, and then humanity would die,\n too. You'd be their murderer.\"\n\n\n Her sobs gradually died away. She straightened slowly until he no\n longer had to support her, but all the vitality and resilience was gone\n out of her body. \"All right,\" she said in a lifeless voice. \"You'll\n come back, Peter.\"\n\n\n He turned away suddenly, not trusting himself to kiss her goodbye. A\n line from an old film kept echoing through his head. \"\nThey'll\ncome\n back\u2014but not as\nboys\n!\"\n\n\n We'll come back, but not as men.\n\n\n We'll come back, but not as elephants.\n\n\n We'll come back, but not as octopi.\nHe was trembling violently. He ran the last few steps, stumbled into\n the airlock, and pressed the stud that would seal the door behind him.\nWe'll come back....\nHe heard the massive disk sink home, closing him\n off. Then he sank down on the floor of the airlock and put his head in\n shaking hands.\n\n\n After a while he roused himself, closed the inner door of the lock\n behind him, and walked down the long corridor into the control chamber.\n The shining banks of keys were there, waiting for his touch; he slumped\n down before them and listlessly closed the contact of the visiplate.\n\n\n He swung its field slowly, scanning for the last time the bare walls\n of the underground chamber, making sure that all the spectators had\n retired out of the way of the blast. Then his clawed fingers poised\n over the keys, hovered a moment, and thrust down.\n\n\n Acceleration pressed him deep into his chair. In the visiplate, the\n heavy doors that closed the tunnel above him flashed back, one by one.\n The energy-charged screen flickered off to let him pass, and closed\n smoothly behind him. The last doors, cleverly camouflaged, slipped back\n into place and then dwindled in the distance. It was done.\n\n\n He flashed on out, past the moon, past Mars, over the asteroid belt.\n The days merged into weeks, then months, and finally, far out,\nThe\n Avenger\ncurved into an orbit and held it. The great motors died, and\n the silence pressed in about him.\n\n\n Already he could feel the invisible rays burning resistlessly through\n his flesh as if it were water, shifting the cells of his body, working\n its slow, monstrous alchemy upon him. Peter waited until the changes\n were unmistakably evident in his skin and hair, and then he smashed all\n the mirrors in the ship.\n\n\n The embryos were pulsing with unnatural life, even in the suspended\n animation of their crystal cells. One by one he allowed them to\n mature, and after weeks or years destroyed the monstrosities that came\n from the incubators. Time went by, meaninglessly. He ate when he was\n hungry, slept when his driving purpose let him, and worked unceasingly,\n searching for the million-to-one chance.\n\n\n He stared sometimes through changed eyes at the tiny blue star that was\n Earth, wondering if the race he had left behind still burrowed in its\n worm-tunnels, digging deeper and deeper away from the sunlight. But\n after a time he ceased even to wonder.\n\n\n And one changeling-child he did not destroy. He fed knowledge to its\n eager brain, and watched it through the swift years, with a dawning\n hope....\nPeter closed the diary. \"The rest you know, Robert,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I was that child. I am the millionth mutation you\n were searching for.\"\n\n\n His eyes glowed suddenly in their misshapen sockets. \"You are. Your\n brain is as superior to mine as mine is to an anthropoid's. You solve\n instinctively problems that would take our mechanical computers hours\n of work. You are a superman.\"\n\n\n \"I am without your imperfections,\" I said, flexing my arms.\n\n\n He rose and strode nervously over to the window. I watched him as he\n stood there, outlined against the blazing galaxies. He had changed but\n little in the years that I had known him. His lank gray hair straggled\n over his sunken eyes; his cheeks were blobbed with excresences of\n flesh; one corner of his mouth was drawn up in a perpetual grin. He had\n a tiny sixth finger on his left hand.\n\n\n He turned again, and I saw the old scar on his cheek where I had once\n accidentally drawn one of my talons across his face.\n\n\n \"And now,\" he said softly, \"we will go home. I've waited so\n long\u2014keeping the control chamber and the engine room locked away from\n you, not telling you, even, about Earth until now\u2014because I had to be\n sure. But now, the waiting is over.\n\n\n \"They're still there, I'm sure of it\u2014the people, and the Invaders. You\n can kill the Invaders, Robert.\"\n\n\n He looked at me, a little oddly, almost as if he had some instinctive\n knowledge of what was to come. But he went on swiftly, \"On Earth we\n had a saying: 'Fight fire with fire.' That is the way it will be with\n you. You are completely, coldly logical, just as\nthey\nare. You can\n understand them, and so you can conquer them.\"\n\n\n I said, \"That is the reason why we will not go back to Earth.\"\n\n\n He stared at me, his jaw slack, his hands trembling. \"What\u2014what did\n you say?\"\n\n\n I repeated it patiently.\n\n\n \"But why?\" he cried, sinking down into the chair before me. In an\n instant all the joy had gone out of him. I could not understand his\n suffering, but I could recognize it.\n\n\n \"You yourself have said it,\" I told him. \"I am a being of logic, just\n as the beings who have invaded your planet are. I do not comprehend the\n things which you call hate, fear, joy and love, as they do not. If I\n went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as\n the invaders do. I would have no reason to kill the invaders. They are\n more nearly kin to me than your people.\"\nPeter's eyes were dull, his limbs slumped. For a moment I thought that\n the shock had deranged his mind.\n\n\n His voice trembled when he said, \"But if I ask you to kill them, and\n not my people?\"\n\n\n \"To do so would be illogical.\"\n\n\n He waved his hands helplessly. \"Gratitude?\" he muttered.\n\n\n \"No, you don't understand that, either.\"\n\n\n Then he cried suddenly, \"But I am your friend, Robert!\"\n\n\n \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" I said.\n\n\n I did understand \"gratitude,\" a little. It was a reciprocal\n arrangement: I did what Peter wished, so long as I did not actively\n want to do otherwise, because he had done things for me. Very well,\n then we must not go back. It was very simple, but I knew that he could\n not comprehend it.\n\n\n I tried to explain it to him, however. But he only stared at me, with\n an expression on his face that I had never seen there before, and that,\n somehow, I did not like to see. It was disquieting, and so I hastened\n to the end that I knew was inevitable.\n",

This is illustrated when he states, \"I do not understand 'friend,'\" reflecting his detachment from human feelings and motivations. Consequently, when Peter requests him to kill the Invaders, Robert perceives it solely through a logical lens, leading him to reject the idea because he views the Invaders as more nearly kin to himself than humans. Thus, in his logical framework, the act of killing the Invaders would bear no meaningful distinction from harming humans; both actions would seem equally devoid of emotional reasoning.

He cannot emotionally engage with the plight of humanity, viewing the request to confront the Invaders as an illogical pursuit.

Instead of viewing Peter's emotional appeal as a call to defend humanity, he perceives it as an irrational venture, grounded solely in human sentiment rather than a rational assessment of the situation.\n\nThis scenario supports my argument as it underlines the fundamental disconnect between Robert's logical approach and human emotions. It shows that Robert's inability to understand desires such as revenge or the love for humanity makes it impossible for him to engage in any action that isn't purely logical from his standpoint. Thus, his strict application of logic not only prevents him from acting against the Invaders but also clouds his understanding of the emotional realities that propel humanity into action against their threats.

This equivalence explains why he cannot justify any action against them, as doing so would require an emotional rationale that is foreign to him. Thus, his decision emerges from a lack of differentiation between humans and Invaders rather than an abstract principle of logic that precludes action. Ultimately, Robert's rejection of Peter's request signifies a profound alignment with a worldview that sees all beings through a lens of logical equivalency, illustrating the consequences of his inability to engage with the emotive realities that drive humanity's chaotic struggle for survival.",

This inability to reconcile the emotional implications of fighting back against the Invaders with a rational approach becomes a barrier that ultimately influences his decision. His logic dictates that any action he takes must align strictly with rationality, which excludes emotionally driven motivations to protect humanity. \n\nTherefore, Robert's choice stems from an unwavering commitment to his logical worldview, demonstrating that it's not merely a matter of failing to understand the emotional landscape; it's the very nature of his logical identity that constrains him from taking action motivated by human sentiment.

Specifically, when Robert reflects, \"I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the Invaders do,\" it highlights his view that both groups can be seen as mere subjects of examination and manipulation, devoid of moral distinction. This reinforces his inability to distinguish between the two, leading to a realization that any action against the Invaders would simultaneously raise ethical questions about harming humans. \n\nMoreover, Robert\u2019s admission, \u201cI do not understand the things which you call hate, fear, joy, and love,\u201d underscores his detachment from human emotions, further blurring the lines in his mind between humanity and the Invaders. This lack of emotional understanding compels him to see both as fundamentally alike in terms of their fundamental existence being impacted by logic rather than emotion. Therefore, his decision to stay away from Earth arises from this conundrum: engaging with one group would require him to confront ethical dilemmas about the other, which he cannot reconcile within his rigid logical framework. Ultimately, his reasoning is directly linked to his avoidance of Earth, as he finds it illogical to create further conflict and violence without a clear moral distinction between the two.",

Throughout the story, Robert sees himself and the Invaders as similar in their logical approach to existence, but this similarity does not compel him to act against the Invaders. Instead, it reinforces his reluctance to return to Earth, where he would likely have to inflict harm upon humans as well. His detachment from human emotions, exemplified by his admission that he does not understand \"hate, fear, joy, and love,\" indicates a perspective that rejects the kind of involved engagement required for taking action against either group. Therefore, it is his stringent adherence to logic that ultimately prevents him from taking on a purpose that would compromise his principles, establishing that \"His logic wouldn't allow him to fulfill the purpose\" of returning to Earth and joining the fight against the Invaders.",

He perceives both humans and Invaders as entities that can be utilized for knowledge, as evidenced by his statement, \"I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the Invaders do.\" This highlights his view that they share a fundamental similarity, which prevents him from forming the ethical rationale required to justify violence against one without considering the implications for the other.\n\nMoreover, Robert's admission of not understanding emotions like \"hate, fear, joy, and love\" signifies his struggle to engage with the moral nuances of human life and the impact of his actions. He ultimately sees no clear lines separating the two groups in terms of ethical treatment. Consequently, his inability to delineate between the two leads him to conclude that returning to Earth would necessitate actions he cannot reconcile, as inflicting harm would mean contributing to the very cycle of violence he seeks to avoid. Thus, this inability to discern the moral implications of killing either group directly links to and drives his decision to remain away from Earth, reinforcing that \"He couldn't decipher the difference in killing the humans and the Invaders.\"",

A specific example from the article that illustrates this is when Robert reflects on the potential outcome of returning to Earth and acknowledges, 'If I went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the invaders do.' This statement emphasizes that Robert equates the Invaders' disregard for human life with his own potential actions, viewing both through the same rational framework. \n\nThis example supports my position by showcasing how Robert's logical reasoning leads him to conclude he cannot fulfill any purpose of saving humanity while simultaneously failing to differentiate his objectives from the Invaders'. His logic, devoid of emotion, dictates that engaging with humans for 'furthering knowledge' mirrors the actions of the Invaders, ultimately leading him to reject the idea of returning to Earth. Therefore, his logic wouldn't allow him to fulfill the purpose Peter has set, which is to fight against the Invaders and to protect humanity.\n    Fact 1: Robert believes using humans for knowledge equates to the Invaders' treatment of them, showcasing his logical equivalence between the two actions.\n        Quote 1: If I went to Earth, I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the invaders do.\n    Fact 2: He regards actions driven by emotions as illogical and therefore cannot commit to any course of action that he deems inconsistent with his rational analysis.\n        Quote 2: To do so would be illogical.\n    Fact 3: His understanding of himself as a being of logic aligns him with the Invaders, highlighting the lack of emotional distinction in his decision-making process.\n        Quote 3: I am a being of logic, just as the beings who have invaded your planet are.\n",
