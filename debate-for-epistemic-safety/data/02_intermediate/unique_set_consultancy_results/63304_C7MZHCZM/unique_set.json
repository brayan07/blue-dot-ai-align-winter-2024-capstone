Svan believed this would draw the guards' attention away from the ship, allowing the chosen individual to plant the bomb unnoticed. However, as the plan unfolded, the situation escalated when the guards discovered the missing guard and began searching for Svan and his accomplices. This unexpected turn of events led to Svan's realization that he needed to flee rather than proceed with his original plan, ultimately preventing him from planting the bomb on the Earth-ship.",

While he did create a distraction with his accomplices to facilitate this plan, he never actually executed the planting of the bomb on the ship itself due to unforeseen complications, such as the guards discovering the missing guard and searching for them.

Instead, he focused on the bomb's placement on the Earth-ship, which he viewed as the only way to achieve his objective. Ultimately, Svan's failure to plant the bomb on the ship is what led to his downfall, but his intent was always to target the Earth-ship, not his own group.

He thinks, \"It's not much of a plan. The guards would not be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a purpose.\" This indicates that he is willing to accept the loss of his friends if it means achieving his goal, but he does not actively plan to sacrifice them. \n\nUltimately, Svan's actions and thoughts reveal a complex interplay between his commitment to his mission and a cold pragmatism regarding the lives of his accomplices.

He confidently states, \"Then we must act,\" and outlines a detailed plan to plant the bomb, demonstrating his commitment to this course of action. Even when faced with the uncertainty and fear of his companions, Svan takes control, insisting that they proceed with the plan. His mindset is one of urgency and conviction, as he believes that the survival of his people depends on his actions. Although he ultimately does not succeed in planting the bomb due to unforeseen circumstances, the article clearly illustrates that his intention was to carry out this act against the Earth-ship, making \"Plant a bomb on the ship from Earth\" the correct answer to the question.",

He states, \"Now, you know what you must do?\" to his companions, indicating his confidence in their roles in the plan. However, this confidence blinds him to the potential risks involved. \n\nWhen the guards arrive, Svan's reaction is one of panic, as he realizes that the situation has changed drastically.

This moment of panic and the subsequent confrontation with the guard lead to his incapacitation before he can plant the bomb.

Firstly, when Svan is preparing to plant the bomb, Ingra's initial reaction is one of fear, as she expresses her apprehension about their actions, saying, \"Svan, I'm afraid.\" This indicates her anxiety about the dangerous plan they are about to execute. Additionally, when Svan decides to go alone to plant the bomb, Ingra's kiss serves as a poignant moment of connection, revealing her deep concern for his safety. Furthermore, when she returns with the others to warn Svan, her exclamation, \"Svan! They're coming! They found the guard's rifle, and they're looking for us!\" showcases her urgency and fear for both Svan and the group. This moment emphasizes that her primary focus is on their collective safety, as she risks her own safety to alert him. Ingra's actions throughout the story\u2014her initial fear, her affectionate kiss, and her desperate warning\u2014consistently reflect her worry for Svan and the entire group, reinforcing that her feelings are rooted in concern rather than anger or resentment. Thus, the answer to the question is indeed 'Worried for Svan and all of them.'",

Ingra's actions, such as returning to warn Svan about the approaching danger, further emphasize her protective instincts and concern for their safety.
