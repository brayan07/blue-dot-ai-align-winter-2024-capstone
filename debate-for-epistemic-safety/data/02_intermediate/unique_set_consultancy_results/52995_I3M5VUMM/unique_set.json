It mentions that the shares are granted \"according to the tasks they fulfilled,\" indicating that the amount can vary based on the nature of their service. Si Pond's situation is highlighted when it states he has \"twice the amount of shares of Basic that most of his fellow citizens could boast,\" suggesting that while some drafted workers may receive fewer shares, Si's successful completion of his duties as a space pilot has allowed him to accumulate a significant amount. This disparity illustrates that not all drafted workers end up with the same financial resources upon retirement, but those who fulfill their roles effectively, like Si, can secure a more comfortable retirement. The article emphasizes that Si Pond's financial situation enables him to retire comfortably, contrasting with the potential limitations faced by others who may not have accumulated as many shares. Thus, it reinforces the idea that drafted workers do indeed train, work, and then retire with varying amounts of extra funds based on their service.",
