This indicates that he is not merely a hired gun; he is also contemplating the broader implications of the conflict and the potential consequences for both the Mercurians and the Terrestrials.\n\nAdditionally, Jaro's interactions with characters like Joan Webb reveal a growing awareness of the complexities of the situation. When he discusses the nature of the Mercurians and their history of passive resistance, it shows that he is beginning to understand the stakes involved beyond just the monetary aspect. However, these motivations serve more as background details that enrich his character rather than primary drivers of his actions. Ultimately, while they add depth to Jaro's persona and suggest a potential for moral consideration, they do not overshadow his financial motivation, which remains the most significant factor influencing his decision to sneak out and pursue the original contract he was offered.

During their interaction, Jaro directly challenges Peet's motives and the situation at hand. He states, \"You actually run Mercury, and you've squeezed out every possible penny. Every time self-government has come before the Earth Congress you've succeeded in blocking it,\" which reveals his understanding of the power dynamics at play and his suspicion of Peet's intentions. This confrontation illustrates Jaro's commitment to exposing the truth, as he is not afraid to confront those in power about their actions and the potential consequences of a revolution.\n\nMoreover, Jaro's refusal to be bought off when Peet offers him a financial incentive further emphasizes his dedication to uncovering the truth rather than simply seeking personal gain. He responds to Peet's offer by saying, \"I'm not ready to be bought off. I think I'll deal myself a hand in this game,\" indicating that he is willing to take risks to get to the bottom of the situation.
