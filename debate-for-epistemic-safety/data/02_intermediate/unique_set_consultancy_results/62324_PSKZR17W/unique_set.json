However, the primary factor impacting their tab was still the cost of the water, which they were unaware of until after they had consumed it. The article states that the bartender filled eight jiggers with whiskey while they were drinking the water, but it was the unexpected charge of forty buckos for the water that shocked them. Joe's outburst, \"That\u2014that's robbery!\" highlights their disbelief at the water's price, which ultimately led to their large tab. While the whiskey was consumed, it was the water's cost that significantly contributed to their financial predicament, as they had not anticipated paying for it at such a high rate.",
