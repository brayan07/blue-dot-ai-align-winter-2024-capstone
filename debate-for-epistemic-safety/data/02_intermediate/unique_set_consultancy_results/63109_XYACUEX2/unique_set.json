In the article, she recounts how the Green Flames were once used to maintain control during the dictatorship of Vennox I, stating, \"The cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long enough to endanger all civilized life.\" This indicates that the Green Flames have a history of being utilized as a tool of oppression, leading to societal bondage and unrest. Grannie Annie warns that if these radioactive rocks were to fall into the wrong hands again, it could replicate the past's disastrous consequences. She emphasizes that the current unrest, with riots and demands for dictatorial leadership, creates a ripe environment for the Green Flames to be exploited, stating, \"The time is ripe for a military dictator to step in.\" Thus, her fears are not unfounded; they are based on a clear historical precedent where the Green Flames contributed to manipulation and oppression, making her concerns about their potential re-emergence in today's restless political climate both relevant and urgent.",

In the article, she notes that there have been \"riots on Earth and Mars, police officials murdered on Pluto,\" indicating a level of violence and instability that could easily be exploited by those seeking power. This contrasts with the past, where the Green Flames were used under a singular dictatorship, Vennox I, which, while oppressive, was more centralized in its control. \n\nToday, the environment is marked by fragmented authority and a populace that is increasingly desperate for leadership, making it easier for a new dictator to rise by capitalizing on the chaos. Grannie Annie's perception of Doctor Universe's involvement is particularly troubling for her; she suspects that he may be connected to the resurgence of the Green Flames and the manipulation of the public. She implies that his quiz program could be a distraction or a means to control the masses, stating, \"This is a lot bigger than a simple quiz program.\" This connection amplifies her fears that the Green Flames could be weaponized again, leading to a repeat of history's darkest moments, thus making her concerns about their potential impact in today's environment even more pressing.",
