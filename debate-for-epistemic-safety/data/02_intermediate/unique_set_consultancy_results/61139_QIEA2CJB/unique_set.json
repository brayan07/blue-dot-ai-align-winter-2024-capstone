Her insistence on Retief accepting the invitation to the recital and her admonition that \"you can't offend the Groaci\" indicate that she derives satisfaction from maintaining positive relations and adhering to the norms that please them. This concern is not merely about fulfilling her duties; it also reveals a deeper appreciation for the role she plays in fostering goodwill and understanding between the two cultures. Her actions, such as writing letters in the style of her predecessor and her desire to avoid reopening past grievances, suggest that she finds fulfillment in her role as a diplomat who respects and aligns with Groacian preferences. Therefore, it is clear that she enjoys doing her job in a way that resonates with the Groacians, as her actions are driven by both a sense of duty and a personal inclination to maintain harmony in her diplomatic relations.",

Instead, her focus is primarily on adhering to Groacian expectations and maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, when she insists that Retief must accept the invitation to the recital, her tone is more about obligation than enjoyment, as she states, \"You can't offend the Groaci.\" This indicates her prioritization of cultural sensitivity over personal satisfaction.\n\nHer feelings about adhering to Groacian expectations seem to stem from a sense of duty rather than a genuine enjoyment of the culture itself. While she may appreciate the importance of her role in fostering good relations, her actions are driven by a desire to avoid conflict and maintain the status quo rather than a personal engagement with Groacian customs. This contrasts with Retief's more adventurous and confrontational approach, which suggests that Miss Meuhl finds her satisfaction in compliance and the smooth functioning of diplomatic relations rather than in actively engaging with or enjoying the new culture. Thus, her enjoyment appears to be more about fulfilling her responsibilities effectively than about any personal connection to the Groacian way of life.",
