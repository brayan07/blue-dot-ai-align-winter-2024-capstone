Gubelin expresses his frustration by stating, \"If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space Exploration.\" This quote clearly illustrates the leaders' fear that without Si's participation, the Department would be seen as ineffective and could lose its funding. The urgency of their situation is further emphasized by Gubelin's insistence that they must find a way to bring Si out of retirement, indicating that the survival of their exploration efforts hinges on his decision to continue piloting. This language underscores the critical nature of Si's role and the high stakes involved in his retirement, reinforcing the argument that his continued involvement is essential for the Department's future.",
