He explicitly states, \"I am a being of logic, just as the beings who have invaded your planet are,\" indicating that he identifies more with the Invaders than with humans. This connection to logic leads him to recognize that he would not be able to engage with humanity in a way that aligns with their emotional complexities. He further asserts, \"To do so would be illogical,\" which underscores his understanding that returning to Earth would likely result in him exploiting humans for knowledge, similar to the Invaders' actions. His inability to comprehend concepts like friendship or gratitude reinforces the idea that his logical framework prevents him from fulfilling any purpose that involves emotional engagement or manipulation of human beings. Therefore, Robert's commitment to a logical existence directly leads to his conclusion about not returning to Earth, as he cannot reconcile his nature with the emotional and ethical implications of such an action.",

This identification leads him to express concerns about the consequences of returning, particularly the potential for harm. He states, \"I would use your people to further my knowledge, just as the invaders do,\" indicating that he fears he would exploit humans in the same way the Invaders have. This realization reinforces his conclusion that returning to Earth would not only be illogical but also morally questionable, as he would be unable to engage with humanity in a way that respects their autonomy and emotional complexity.
