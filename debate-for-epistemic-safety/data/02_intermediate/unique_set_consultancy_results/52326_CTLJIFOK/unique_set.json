This sudden shift in environment could also be considered shocking, as he is disoriented and unsure of how he arrived there.\n\nHowever, the shock of seeing the ant-men is particularly profound because it directly confronts Myles with the reality of his past enemies, which he thought he had vanquished. The article emphasizes this by illustrating his immediate reaction of horror, which is more intense than his initial confusion about his surroundings. The emotional weight of facing a known threat he believed was eliminated adds a layer of urgency and fear that surpasses the initial shock of his new environment.

Initially, he is disoriented, wondering where he is and how he got there, as indicated by his thoughts: \"He fell to wondering, vaguely and pleasantly, where he was and how he had got here.\" However, this confusion quickly dissipates when he hears the familiar sound of an approaching airplane, which triggers a sense of recognition and dread. The moment he sees the Formians, his emotional state shifts dramatically; he is filled with horror and instinctual fear, as he realizes he is once again facing the very beings he had fought against before. The article captures this emotional turmoil when it states, \"His heart glowed with the warmth of homecoming,\" only to be replaced by the chilling realization of the ant-men's presence. This juxtaposition of feelings\u2014initial wonderment followed by fear\u2014highlights the shock of encountering enemies he believed were dead, showcasing the depth of his emotional response beyond just the physical act of grabbing the driftwood.",
