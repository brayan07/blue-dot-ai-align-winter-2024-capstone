Instead, the context suggests that Stanley was acting on his own accord as an aggressor. When Stanley enters the room, he is described as \"the pale-faced young man\" who is visibly upset after being shot by Jaro. Albert Peet's reaction to Stanley's injury is one of concern, as he asks, \"But how badly?\" and expresses distress over the situation, indicating that he is more concerned about Stanley's well-being than any protective motive.\n\nFurthermore, the article portrays Peet as someone who is involved in dubious dealings regarding the Latonka trade and the potential revolution, which adds to the notion that Stanley's actions were not about protection but rather part of the larger, more complex conflict surrounding their interests. Therefore, the evidence supports that Stanley was not protecting Peet but rather acting aggressively against Jaro Moynahan.",

In this tense moment, Moynahan acted in self-defense to protect himself from Stanley, who was acting as an enforcer for Albert Peet. The article states, \"Stanley, his mouth twisted in pain... 'You've broken my shoulder. I'll kill you.'\" This indicates that Stanley was not merely a bystander but was actively trying to protect Peet's interests, which Moynahan had threatened by refusing to be bought off.

The text notes, \"Stanley... the dart gun in his good hand,\" which clearly shows that Stanley was armed and ready to attack. Additionally, when Moynahan describes the situation, he mentions, \"The pale-faced young man crumpled like an empty sack,\" after he shot Stanley in self-defense, further illustrating that Stanley was indeed a threat to Moynahan's safety.
