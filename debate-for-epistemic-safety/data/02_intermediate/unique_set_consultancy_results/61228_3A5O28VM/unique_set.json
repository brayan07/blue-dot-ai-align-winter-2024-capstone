The Army doctor explicitly states, \"Now he is a moron,\" which underscores the severity of Macklin's condition after the treatment. Additionally, Colonel Carson's reaction highlights the gravity of this change, as he expresses that Macklin's diminished intelligence poses a significant risk to vital military projects, stating, \"You might just as well have blown up Washington, D.C.\" Furthermore, the article discusses potential physical health concerns, such as low blood pressure, which could have compounded the situation. However, the primary focus remains on Macklin's cognitive decline, as evidenced by the Army doctor's assessment and the implications of his new mental state. This classification as a moron is central to the narrative, emphasizing the consequences of the treatment on both Macklin's life and the broader scientific and military interests.",

The Army doctor and Colonel Carson are primarily concerned about Macklin's intelligence because he is essential for the development of the faster-than-light drive, which is crucial for military advancements. Carson's statement, \"You might just as well have blown up Washington, D.C.,\" illustrates the high stakes involved; losing Macklin's intellectual capabilities could hinder the Army's progress in a significant way.\n\nWhile low blood pressure is mentioned as a potential risk, it is framed within the context of the cognitive decline. The article suggests that the treatment could lead to low blood pressure, but the immediate and pressing concern is Macklin's mental state and its implications for his work. The Army's interest lies in maintaining Macklin's genius, as his cognitive abilities are irreplaceable, whereas physical health issues, while serious, do not carry the same level of urgency in terms of national security and scientific advancement. Thus, the cognitive decline is portrayed as the more significant concern in the context of the Army doctor's worries.",
