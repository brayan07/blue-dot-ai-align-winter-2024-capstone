Capt. Wilkins notes that the mixture was \"glowing cherry red,\" indicating a dangerous exothermic reaction that generated significant heat. This reaction was exacerbated by the confined conditions within the dome, where the mixture was being mixed. As the mixture became increasingly hot, it began to melt and fall onto the air tank, which Capt. Wilkins feared would weaken. His concern is validated when he observes the mixture melting down and warns the others, \"Watch out! There. There!\" just before a bright flare erupts from the dome, signifying that the integrity of the air tank was compromised. The combination of the exothermic reaction from the calking mixture and its direct contact with the air tank led to the catastrophic failure, resulting in the loss of air. This sequence of events clearly establishes that the leaking calking mixture was the critical factor in the explosion, making it the correct answer to the question.",
