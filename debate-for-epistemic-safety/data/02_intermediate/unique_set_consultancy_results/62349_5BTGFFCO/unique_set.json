For example, Gow, the zoo-man, expresses concern about Gertrude, the star attraction, stating, \"Gertrude's actin' up again\" and \"She ain't happy. If something...,\" which indicates that the circus's failure to properly care for their animals could lead to further complications. This mismanagement not only threatens the well-being of their key attraction but also jeopardizes their ability to draw in audiences and generate revenue. The narrator's acknowledgment that \"we'd have to cancel several engagements\" if they did not secure funding further emphasizes their precarious situation. Ultimately, the combination of being out of money and lacking the means to manage their operations effectively\u2014especially the care of their animals\u2014leads to the conclusion that the circus is indeed out of options, making it clear that they are on the brink of closure.",

The main reason for the circus being in danger of closing is their lack of funds, as explicitly stated by Bucky Shannon when he declares, \"We are broke.

However, the mismanagement of their animals, particularly Gertrude, adds to their troubles by threatening their ability to attract audiences and maintain a successful operation. For instance, Gow's concerns about Gertrude's well-being highlight that if the animals are not cared for properly, it could lead to further complications that would exacerbate their financial woes. Thus, while the inability to manage the animals is significant, it serves as a contributing factor to the overarching issue of being out of money and options, which is the primary reason for the circus's imminent closure.",
