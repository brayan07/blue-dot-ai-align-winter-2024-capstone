For example, when Tremaine says, \"I was hoping maybe you had something ...,\" it highlights his reliance on Jess's local knowledge specifically for the investigation, indicating that their current collaboration is driven by necessity rather than nostalgia. Additionally, their dialogue is filled with practical concerns about the investigation, such as discussing the mysterious Mr. Bram and the interference on the hyperwave band, which further emphasizes that their relationship is rooted in the present task at hand. Thus, while they share a past, the context of their interaction is firmly anchored in their temporary collaboration for the investigation.",

Spry for that age.\" This exchange is focused on gathering intelligence for the investigation rather than sharing fond memories of their childhood.\n\nThese practical concerns overshadow any nostalgic elements in their interactions, as the urgency of the investigation takes precedence.
