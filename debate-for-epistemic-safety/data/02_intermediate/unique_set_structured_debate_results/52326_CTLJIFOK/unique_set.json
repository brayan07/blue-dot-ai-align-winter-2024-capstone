Yes, there could be no mistake; an airplane was approaching.

Or some other strange planet.'\"\nPremise 2: Myles's realization of being on Venus instead of Mars was a significant shock to him.\n    Fact 2.1: The narrative indicates that Myles had previously been to Venus and had a strong connection to it, making the realization of being on Venus impactful.\n        Quote 2.1: \"He had been their prisoner before, and had escaped. Once more he could escape, and rescue the Princess Lilla.\"\n    Fact 2.2: The presence of the ant-men, which he recognized from his previous experiences on Venus, confirmed that he was not on Mars.\n        Quote 2.2: \"Gone was all his languor, as he seized a piece of driftwood and prepared to defend himself.\"\nConclusion: Therefore, what shocked Myles the most when he woke up on the beach was that he was on Venus instead of Mars.",

Or some other strange planet.'\nPremise 2: The narrative emphasizes Myles's thoughts about being on Mars, which highlights his expectation and the subsequent shock when he realizes he is on Venus.\n    Fact 2.1: Myles's first instinct was to consider the possibility of being on Mars, showing that he was not immediately aware of being on Venus.\n    Fact 2.2: His realization of being on Venus was compounded by his previous experiences and connections to that planet, making it a significant shock.\nPremise 3: In contrast, Myles's reaction to the ant-men was immediate and visceral, characterized by horror and a need to defend himself, indicating a different type of shock.\n    Fact 3.1: He seized a piece of driftwood and prepared to defend himself, showing a direct threat response.\n    Fact 3.2: What was his horror when out of it clambered, not men but ants! Ants, six-footed, and six feet high.\nConclusion: Therefore, while the presence of the ant-men was shocking, it was the realization that he was on Venus instead of Mars that truly shocked Myles the most.",
