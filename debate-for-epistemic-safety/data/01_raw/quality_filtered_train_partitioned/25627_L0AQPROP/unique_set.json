  "article": "THE\n\n HUNTED\n\n HEROES\nBy ROBERT SILVERBERG\nThe planet itself was tough enough\u2014barren, desolate,\n forbidding; enough to stop the most adventurous and\n dedicated. But they had to run head-on against a mad\n genius who had a motto:\nDeath to all Terrans!\n\"Let's\n keep moving,\" I told\n Val. \"The surest way to\n die out here on Mars is to\n give up.\" I reached over and\n turned up the pressure on her\n oxymask to make things a\n little easier for her. Through\n the glassite of the mask, I\n could see her face contorted\n in an agony of fatigue.\n\n\n And she probably thought\n the failure of the sandcat was\n all my fault, too. Val's usually\n about the best wife a guy\n could ask for, but when she\n wants to be she can be a real\n flying bother.\n\n\n It was beyond her to see\n that some grease monkey back\n at the Dome was at fault\u2014whoever\n it was who had failed\n to fasten down the engine\n hood. Nothing but what had\n stopped us\ncould\nstop a sandcat:\n sand in the delicate\n mechanism of the atomic engine.\n\n\n But no; she blamed it all on\n me somehow: So we were out\n walking on the spongy sand\n of the Martian desert. We'd\n been walking a good eight\n hours.\n\n\n \"Can't we turn back now,\n Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe\n there isn't any uranium in\n this sector at all. I think\n we're crazy to keep on searching\n out here!\"\n\n\n I started to tell her that the\n UranCo chief had assured me\n we'd hit something out this\n way, but changed my mind.\n When Val's tired and overwrought\n there's no sense in\n arguing with her.\n\n\n I stared ahead at the bleak,\n desolate wastes of the Martian\n landscape. Behind us\n somewhere was the comfort\n of the Dome, ahead nothing\n but the mazes and gullies of\n this dead world.\nHe was a cripple in a wheelchair\u2014helpless as a rattlesnake.\n\"Try to keep going, Val.\"\n My gloved hand reached out\n and clumsily enfolded hers.\n \"Come on, kid. Remember\u2014we're\n doing this for Earth.\n We're heroes.\"\n\n\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,\n hell!\" she muttered. \"That's\n the way it looked back home,\n but, out there it doesn't seem\n so glorious. And UranCo's\n pay is stinking.\"\n\n\n \"We didn't come out here\n for the pay, Val.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know, but just\n the same\u2014\"\n\n\n It must have been hell for\n her. We had wandered fruitlessly\n over the red sands all\n day, both of us listening for\n the clicks of the counter. And\n the geigers had been obstinately\n hushed all day, except\n for their constant undercurrent\n of meaningless noises.\n\n\n Even though the Martian\n gravity was only a fraction of\n Earth's, I was starting to\n tire, and I knew it must have\n been really rough on Val with\n her lovely but unrugged legs.\n\n\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.\n \"We're not heroes\u2014we're\n suckers! Why did I ever let\n you volunteer for the Geig\n Corps and drag me along?\"\n\n\n Which wasn't anywhere\n close to the truth. Now I\n knew she was at the breaking\n point, because Val didn't lie\n unless she was so exhausted\n she didn't know what she was\n doing. She had been just as\n much inflamed by the idea of\n coming to Mars to help in the\n search for uranium as I was.\n We knew the pay was poor,\n but we had felt it a sort of\n obligation, something we\n could do as individuals to\n keep the industries of radioactives-starved\n Earth going.\n And we'd always had a roving\n foot, both of us.\n\n\n No, we had decided together\n to come to Mars\u2014the\n way we decided together on\n everything. Now she was\n turning against me.\nI tried to jolly her. \"Buck\n up, kid,\" I said. I didn't dare\n turn up her oxy pressure any\n higher, but it was obvious she\n couldn't keep going. She was\n almost sleep-walking now.\n\n\n We pressed on over the\n barren terrain. The geiger\n kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,\n but never broke into\n that sudden explosive tumult\n that meant we had found pay-dirt.\n I started to feel tired\n myself, terribly tired. I longed\n to lie down on the soft,\n spongy Martian sand and\n bury myself.\n\n\n I looked at Val. She was\n dragging along with her eyes\n half-shut. I felt almost guilty\n for having dragged her out to\n Mars, until I recalled that I\n hadn't. In fact, she had come\n up with the idea before I did.\n I wished there was some way\n of turning the weary, bedraggled\n girl at my side back into\n the Val who had so enthusiastically\n suggested we join\n the Geigs.\n\n\n Twelve steps later, I decided\n this was about as far as\n we could go.\n\n\n I stopped, slipped out of\n the geiger harness, and lowered\n myself ponderously to\n the ground. \"What'samatter,\n Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.\n \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting\n out a hand and taking hers.\n \"I think we ought to rest a\n little before we go any further.\n It's been a long, hard\n day.\"\n\n\n It didn't take much to persuade\n her. She slid down beside\n me, curled up, and in a\n moment she was fast asleep,\n sprawled out on the sands.\nPoor kid\n, I thought. Maybe\n we shouldn't have come to\n Mars after all. But, I reminded\n myself,\nsomeone\nhad to do\n the job.\n\n\n A second thought appeared,\n but I squelched it:\n\n\n Why the hell me?\n\n\n I looked down at Valerie's\n sleeping form, and thought of\n our warm, comfortable little\n home on Earth. It wasn't\n much, but people in love don't\n need very fancy surroundings.\n\n\n I watched her, sleeping\n peacefully, a wayward lock of\n her soft blonde hair trailing\n down over one eyebrow, and\n it seemed hard to believe that\n we'd exchanged Earth and all\n it held for us for the raw, untamed\n struggle that was Mars.\n But I knew I'd do it again, if\n I had the chance. It's because\n we wanted to keep what we\n had. Heroes? Hell, no. We\n just liked our comforts, and\n wanted to keep them. Which\n took a little work.\nTime to get moving.\nBut\n then Val stirred and rolled\n over in her sleep, and I didn't\n have the heart to wake her. I\n sat there, holding her, staring\n out over the desert, watching\n the wind whip the sand up\n into weird shapes.\n\n\n The Geig Corps preferred\n married couples, working in\n teams. That's what had finally\n decided it for us\u2014we were a\n good team. We had no ties on\n Earth that couldn't be broken\n without much difficulty. So\n we volunteered.\nAnd here we are.\nHeroes.\n The wind blasted a mass of\n sand into my face, and I felt\n it tinkle against the oxymask.\n\n\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.\n Getting late. I decided\n once again to wake Val.\n But she was tired. And I was\n tired too, tired from our\n wearying journey across the\n empty desert.\n\n\n I started to shake Val. But\n I never finished. It would be\nso\nnice just to lean back and\n nuzzle up to her, down in the\n sand. So nice. I yawned, and\n stretched back.\nI awoke with a sudden startled\n shiver, and realized angrily\n I had let myself doze off.\n \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,\n and started to rise to\n my feet.\n\n\n I couldn't.\n\n\n I looked down. I was neatly\n bound in thin, tough, plastic\n tangle-cord, swathed from\n chin to boot-bottoms, my\n arms imprisoned, my feet\n caught. And tangle-cord is\n about as easy to get out of as\n a spider's web is for a trapped\n fly.\n\n\n It wasn't Martians that\n had done it. There weren't\n any Martians, hadn't been for\n a million years. It was some\n Earthman who had bound us.\n\n\n I rolled my eyes toward\n Val, and saw that she was\n similarly trussed in the sticky\n stuff. The tangle-cord was still\n fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant\n odor like that of drying\n fish. It had been spun on\n us only a short time ago, I\n realized.\n\n\n \"Ron\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to move, baby.\n This stuff can break your\n neck if you twist it wrong.\"\n She continued for a moment\n to struggle futilely, and I had\n to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\n\n\n \"A very wise statement,\"\n said a brittle, harsh voice\n from above me. I looked up\n and saw a helmeted figure\n above us. He wasn't wearing\n the customary skin-tight pliable\n oxysuits we had. He\n wore an outmoded, bulky\n spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,\n all but the face area\n opaque. The oxygen cannisters\n weren't attached to his\n back as expected, though.\n They were strapped to the\n back of the wheelchair in\n which he sat.\n\n\n Through the fishbowl I\n could see hard little eyes, a\n yellowed, parchment-like face,\n a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize\n him, and this struck me\n odd. I thought I knew everyone\n on sparsely-settled Mars.\n Somehow I'd missed him.\n\n\n What shocked me most was\n that he had no legs. The\n spacesuit ended neatly at the\n thighs.\n\n\n He was holding in his left\n hand the tanglegun with\n which he had entrapped us,\n and a very efficient-looking\n blaster was in his right.\n\n\n \"I didn't want to disturb\n your sleep,\" he said coldly.\n \"So I've been waiting here\n for you to wake up.\"\n\n\n I could just see it. He might\n have been sitting there for\n hours, complacently waiting\n to see how we'd wake up.\n That was when I realized he\n must be totally insane. I could\n feel my stomach-muscles\n tighten, my throat constrict\n painfully.\n\n\n Then anger ripped through\n me, washing away the terror.\n \"What's going on?\" I demanded,\n staring at the half\n of a man who confronted us\n from the wheelchair. \"Who\n are you?\"\n\n\n \"You'll find out soon\n enough,\" he said. \"Suppose\n now you come with me.\" He\n reached for the tanglegun,\n flipped the little switch on its\n side to MELT, and shot a\n stream of watery fluid over\n our legs, keeping the blaster\n trained on us all the while.\n Our legs were free.\n\n\n \"You may get up now,\" he\n said. \"Slowly, without trying\n to make trouble.\" Val and I\n helped each other to our feet\n as best we could, considering\n our arms were still tightly\n bound against the sides of our\n oxysuits.\n\n\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,\n waving the tanglegun to indicate\n the direction. \"I'll be\n right behind you.\" He holstered\n the tanglegun.\n\n\n I glimpsed the bulk of an\n outboard atomic rigging behind\n him, strapped to the\n back of the wheelchair. He\n fingered a knob on the arm of\n the chair and the two exhaust\n ducts behind the wheel-housings\n flamed for a moment,\n and the chair began to roll.\n\n\n Obediently, we started\n walking. You don't argue\n with a blaster, even if the\n man pointing it is in a wheelchair.\n\"What's going on, Ron?\"\n Val asked in a low voice as we\n walked. Behind us the wheelchair\n hissed steadily.\n\n\n \"I don't quite know, Val.\n I've never seen this guy before,\n and I thought I knew\n everyone at the Dome.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor\n called, and we stopped\n talking. We trudged along together,\n with him following\n behind; I could hear the\ncrunch-crunch\nof the wheelchair\n as its wheels chewed\n into the sand. I wondered\n where we were going, and\n why. I wondered why we had\n ever left Earth.\n\n\n The answer to that came to\n me quick enough: we had to.\n Earth needed radioactives,\n and the only way to get them\n was to get out and look. The\n great atomic wars of the late\n 20th Century had used up\n much of the supply, but the\n amount used to blow up half\n the great cities of the world\n hardly compared with the\n amount we needed to put\n them back together again.\n\n\n In three centuries the shattered\n world had been completely\n rebuilt. The wreckage\n of New York and Shanghai\n and London and all the other\n ruined cities had been hidden\n by a shining new world of\n gleaming towers and flying\n roadways. We had profited by\n our grandparents' mistakes.\n They had used their atomics\n to make bombs. We used ours\n for fuel.\n\n\n It was an atomic world.\n Everything: power drills,\n printing presses, typewriters,\n can openers, ocean liners,\n powered by the inexhaustible\n energy of the dividing atom.\n\n\n But though the energy is\n inexhaustible, the supply of\n nuclei isn't. After three centuries\n of heavy consumption,\n the supply failed. The mighty\n machine that was Earth's industry\n had started to slow\n down.\n\n\n And that started the chain\n of events that led Val and me\n to end up as a madman's prisoners,\n on Mars. With every\n source of uranium mined dry\n on Earth, we had tried other\n possibilities. All sorts of\n schemes came forth. Project\n Sea-Dredge was trying to get\n uranium from the oceans. In\n forty or fifty years, they'd\n get some results, we hoped.\n But there wasn't forty or\n fifty years' worth of raw stuff\n to tide us over until then. In a\n decade or so, our power would\n be just about gone. I could\n picture the sort of dog-eat-dog\n world we'd revert back\n to. Millions of starving, freezing\n humans tooth-and-clawing\n in it in the useless shell of\n a great atomic civilization.\n\n\n So, Mars. There's not much\n uranium on Mars, and it's not\n easy to find or any cinch to\n mine. But what little is there,\n helps. It's a stopgap effort,\n just to keep things moving\n until Project Sea-Dredge\n starts functioning.\n\n\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers\n out on the face of\n Mars, combing for its uranium\n deposits.\n\n\n And here we are, I thought.\nAfter we walked on a\n while, a Dome became visible\n up ahead. It slid up over the\n crest of a hill, set back between\n two hummocks on the\n desert. Just out of the way\n enough to escape observation.\n\n\n For a puzzled moment I\n thought it was our Dome, the\n settlement where all of UranCo's\n Geig Corps were located,\n but another look told me that\n this was actually quite near\n us and fairly small. A one-man\n Dome, of all things!\n\n\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he\n said. \"The name is Gregory\n Ledman.\" He herded us off to\n one side of the airlock, uttered\n a few words keyed to his\n voice, and motioned us inside\n when the door slid up. When\n we were inside he reached up,\n clumsily holding the blaster,\n and unscrewed the ancient\n spacesuit fishbowl.\n\n\n His face was a bitter,\n dried-up mask. He was a man\n who hated.\n\n\n The place was spartanly\n furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,\n no decoration of any\n sort. Hard bulkhead walls,\n rivet-studded, glared back\n at us. He had an automatic\n chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,\n and no other furniture.\n\n\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun\n and sprayed our legs\n again. We toppled heavily to\n the floor. I looked up angrily.\n\"I imagine you want to\n know the whole story,\" he\n said. \"The others did, too.\"\n\n\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.\n Her pretty face was a\n dead white behind her oxymask.\n \"What others?\"\n\n\n \"I never bothered to find\n out their names,\" Ledman\n said casually. \"They were\n other Geigs I caught unawares,\n like you, out on the\n desert. That's the only sport I\n have left\u2014Geig-hunting. Look\n out there.\"\n\n\n He gestured through the\n translucent skin of the Dome,\n and I felt sick. There was a\n little heap of bones lying\n there, looking oddly bright\n against the redness of the\n sands. They were the dried,\n parched skeletons of Earthmen.\n Bits of cloth and plastic,\n once oxymasks and suits, still\n clung to them.\n\n\n Suddenly I remembered.\n There had been a pattern\n there all the time. We didn't\n much talk about it; we chalked\n it off as occupational hazards.\n There had been a pattern\n of disappearances on the desert.\n I could think of six, eight\n names now. None of them\n had been particularly close\n friends. You don't get time to\n make close friends out here.\n But we'd vowed it wouldn't\n happen to us.\n\n\n It had.\n\n\n \"You've been hunting\n Geigs?\" I asked. \"\nWhy?\nWhat've they ever done to\n you?\"\n\n\n He smiled, as calmly as if\n I'd just praised his house-keeping.\n \"Because I hate\n you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend\n to wipe every last one of\n you out, one by one.\"\n\n\n I stared at him. I'd never\n seen a man like this before; I\n thought all his kind had died\n at the time of the atomic\n wars.\n\n\n I heard Val sob, \"He's a\n madman!\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.\n \"I'm quite sane, believe me.\n But I'm determined to drive\n the Geigs\u2014and UranCo\u2014off\n Mars. Eventually I'll scare\n you all away.\"\n\n\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.\n \"And I have no fears of an\n armed attack. This place is\n well fortified. I've devoted\n years to building it. And I'm\n back against those hills. They\n couldn't pry me out.\" He let\n his pale hand run up into his\n gnarled hair. \"I've devoted\n years to this. Ever since\u2014ever\n since I landed here on\n Mars.\"\n\"What are you going to do\n with us?\" Val finally asked,\n after a long silence.\n\n\n He didn't smile this time.\n \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not\n your husband. I want him as\n an envoy, to go back and tell\n the others to clear off.\" He\n rocked back and forth in his\n wheelchair, toying with the\n gleaming, deadly blaster in\n his hand.\n\n\n We stared in horror. It was\n a nightmare\u2014sitting there,\n placidly rocking back and\n forth, a nightmare.\n\n\n I found myself fervently\n wishing I was back out there\n on the infinitely safer desert.\n\n\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.\n \"I shouldn't\u2014not when\n you see my motives.\"\n\n\n \"We don't see them,\" I\n snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, let me show you.\n You're on Mars hunting uranium,\n right? To mine and\n ship the radioactives back to\n Earth to keep the atomic engines\n going. Right?\"\n\n\n I nodded over at our geiger\n counters.\n\n\n \"We volunteered to come to\n Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\n\n\n \"Ah\u2014two young heroes,\"\n Ledman said acidly. \"How\n sad. I could almost feel sorry\n for you. Almost.\"\n\n\n \"Just what is it you're\n after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\n\n\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"\n he said. \"You remember the\n Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.\n I'd never forget it. No one\n would. How could I forget\n that great accident\u2014killing\n hundreds, injuring thousands\n more, sterilizing forty miles\n of Mississippi land\u2014when\n the Sadlerville pile went up?\n\n\n \"I was there on business at\n the time,\" Ledman said. \"I\n represented Ledman Atomics.\n I was there to sign a new\n contract for my company.\n You know who I am, now?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"I was fairly well shielded\n when it happened. I never got\n the contract, but I got a good\n dose of radiation instead. Not\n enough to kill me,\" he said.\n \"Just enough to necessitate\n the removal of\u2014\" he indicated\n the empty space at his\n thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"\n He gestured at the wheelchair\n blanket.\n\n\n I still didn't understand.\n \"But why kill us Geigs?\nWe\nhad nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n \"You're just in this by accident,\"\n he said. \"You see, after\n the explosion and the amputation,\n my fellow-members on\n the board of Ledman Atomics\n decided that a semi-basket\n case like myself was a poor\n risk as Head of the Board,\n and they took my company\n away. All quite legal, I assure\n you. They left me almost a\n pauper!\" Then he snapped\n the punchline at me.\n\n\n \"They renamed Ledman\n Atomics. Who did you say you\n worked for?\"\n\n\n I began, \"Uran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't bother. A more inventive\n title than Ledman\n Atomics, but not quite as\n much heart, wouldn't you\n say?\" He grinned. \"I saved\n for years; then I came to\n Mars, lost myself, built this\n Dome, and swore to get even.\n There's not a great deal of\n uranium on this planet, but\n enough to keep me in a style\n to which, unfortunately, I'm\n no longer accustomed.\"\nHe consulted his wrist\n watch. \"Time for my injection.\"\n He pulled out the tanglegun\n and sprayed us again,\n just to make doubly certain.\n \"That's another little souvenir\n of Sadlerville. I'm short\n on red blood corpuscles.\"\n\n\n He rolled over to a wall\n table and fumbled in a container\n among a pile of hypodermics.\n \"There are other injections,\n too. Adrenalin, insulin.\n Others. The Blast turned\n me into a walking pin-cushion.\n But I'll pay it all\n back,\" he said. He plunged\n the needle into his arm.\n\n\n My eyes widened. It was\n too nightmarish to be real. I\n wasn't seriously worried\n about his threat to wipe out\n the entire Geig Corps, since\n it was unlikely that one man\n in a wheelchair could pick us\n all off. No, it wasn't the\n threat that disturbed me, so\n much as the whole concept, so\n strange to me, that the human\n mind could be as warped\n and twisted as Ledman's.\n\n\n I saw the horror on Val's\n face, and I knew she felt the\n same way I did.\n\n\n \"Do you really think you\n can succeed?\" I taunted him.\n \"Really think you can kill\n every Earthman on Mars? Of\n all the insane, cockeyed\u2014\"\n\n\n Val's quick, worried head-shake\n cut me off. But Ledman\n had felt my words, all right.\n\n\n \"Yes! I'll get even with\n every one of you for taking\n away my legs! If we hadn't\n meddled with the atom in the\n first place, I'd be as tall and\n powerful as you, today\u2014instead\n of a useless cripple in a\n wheelchair.\"\n\n\n \"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,\"\n Val said quietly.\n \"You've conceived an impossible\n scheme of revenge and\n now you're taking it out on\n innocent people who've done\n nothing, nothing at all to you.\n That's not sane!\"\n\n\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are\n you to talk of sanity?\"\nUneasily I caught Val's\n glance from a corner of my\n eye. Sweat was rolling down\n her smooth forehead faster\n than the auto-wiper could\n swab it away.\n\n\n \"Why don't you do something?\n What are you waiting\n for, Ron?\"\n\n\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I\n knew what our ace in the hole\n was. But I had to get Ledman\n within reach of me first.\n\n\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I'm going\n to turn you loose outside,\n right after\u2014\"\n\n\n \"\nGet sick!\n\" I hissed to Val,\n low. She began immediately\n to cough violently, emitting\n harsh, choking sobs. \"Can't\n breathe!\" She began to yell,\n writhing in her bonds.\n\n\n That did it. Ledman hadn't\n much humanity left in him,\n but there was a little. He lowered\n the blaster a bit and\n wheeled one-hand over to see\n what was wrong with Val.\n She continued to retch and\n moan most horribly. It almost\n convinced me. I saw Val's\n pale, frightened face turn to\n me.\n\n\n He approached and peered\n down at her. He opened his\n mouth to say something, and\n at that moment I snapped my\n leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord\n with a snicking rasp,\n and kicked his wheelchair\n over.\n\n\n The blaster went off, burning\n a hole through the Dome\n roof. The automatic sealers\n glued-in instantly. Ledman\n went sprawling helplessly out\n into the middle of the floor,\n the wheelchair upended next\n to him, its wheels slowly revolving\n in the air. The blaster\n flew from his hands at the\n impact of landing and spun\n out near me. In one quick motion\n I rolled over and covered\n it with my body.\nLedman clawed his way to\n me with tremendous effort\n and tried wildly to pry the\n blaster out from under me,\n but without success. I twisted\n a bit, reached out with my\n free leg, and booted him\n across the floor. He fetched\n up against the wall of the\n Dome and lay there.\n\n\n Val rolled over to me.\n\n\n \"Now if I could get free of\n this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get\n him covered before he comes\n to. But how?\"\n\n\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She\n swivelled around on the floor\n until her head was near my\n boot. \"Push my oxymask off\n with your foot, if you can.\"\n\n\n I searched for the clamp\n and tried to flip it. No luck,\n with my heavy, clumsy boot.\n I tried again, and this time it\n snapped open. I got the tip\n of my boot in and pried upward.\n The oxymask came off,\n slowly, scraping a jagged red\n scratch up the side of Val's\n neck as it came.\n\n\n \"There,\" she breathed.\n \"That's that.\"\n\n\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.\n He was groaning and\n beginning to stir.\n\n\n Val rolled on the floor and\n her face lay near my right\n arm. I saw what she had in\n mind. She began to nibble the\n vile-tasting tangle-cord, running\n her teeth up and down\n it until it started to give. She\n continued unfailingly.\n\n\n Finally one strand snapped.\n Then another. At last I\n had enough use of my hand\n to reach out and grasp the\n blaster. Then I pulled myself\n across the floor to Ledman,\n removed the tanglegun, and\n melted the remaining tangle-cord\n off.\n\n\n My muscles were stiff and\n bunched, and rising made me\n wince. I turned and freed Val.\n Then I turned and faced Ledman.\n\n\n \"I suppose you'll kill me\n now,\" he said.\n\n\n \"No. That's the difference\n between sane people and insane,\"\n I told him. \"I'm not\n going to kill you at all. I'm\n going to see to it that you're\n sent back to Earth.\"\n\n\n \"\nNo!\n\" he shouted. \"No!\n Anything but back there. I\n don't want to face them again\u2014not\n after what they did to\n me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.\n \"They'll help you on Earth.\n They'll take all the hatred and\n sickness out of you, and turn\n you into a useful member of\n society again.\"\n\n\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat\n out. \"I hate all of them.\"\n\n\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.\n \"You're just all full of\n hate. You hated us so much\n that you couldn't bear to hang\n around on Earth for as much\n as a year after the Sadlerville\n Blast. You had to take right\n off for Mars without a moment's\n delay, didn't you? You\n hated Earth so much you\nhad\nto leave.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you telling all\n this to me?\"\n\n\n \"Because if you'd stayed\n long enough, you'd have used\n some of your pension money\n to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic\n legs, and then you\n wouldn't need this wheelchair.\"\n\n\n Ledman scowled, and then\n his face went belligerent\n again. \"They told me I was\n paralyzed below the waist.\n That I'd never walk again,\n even with prosthetic legs, because\n I had no muscles to fit\n them to.\"\n\n\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"\n Val said.\n\n\n \"It was the only way,\" he\n protested. \"I had to get off\u2014\"\n\n\n \"She's right,\" I told him.\n \"The atom can take away, but\n it can give as well. Soon after\n you left they developed\natomic-powered\nprosthetics\u2014amazing\n things, virtually robot\n legs. All the survivors of\n the Sadlerville Blast were\n given the necessary replacement\n limbs free of charge. All\n except you. You were so sick\n you had to get away from the\n world you despised and come\n here.\"\n\n\n \"You're lying,\" he said.\n \"It's not true!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\n\n\n I saw him wilt visibly, and\n for a moment I almost felt\n sorry for him, a pathetic legless\n figure propped up against\n the wall of the Dome at\n blaster-point. But then I remembered\n he'd killed twelve\n Geigs\u2014or more\u2014and would\n have added Val to the number\n had he had the chance.\n\"You're a very sick man,\n Ledman,\" I said. \"All this\n time you could have been\n happy, useful on Earth, instead\n of being holed up here\n nursing your hatred. You\n might have been useful, on\n Earth. But you decided to\n channel everything out as revenge.\"\n\n\n \"I still don't believe it\u2014those\n legs. I might have walked\n again. No\u2014no, it's all a lie.\n They told me I'd never walk,\"\n he said, weakly but stubbornly\n still.\n\n\n I could see his whole structure\n of hate starting to topple,\n and I decided to give it\n the final push.\n\n\n \"Haven't you wondered\n how I managed to break the\n tangle-cord when I kicked you\n over?\"\n\n\n \"Yes\u2014human legs aren't\n strong enough to break tangle-cord\n that way.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I\n gave Val the blaster and slipped\n out of my oxysuit.\n \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to\n my smooth, gleaming metal\n legs. The almost soundless\n purr of their motors was the\n only noise in the room. \"I was\n in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"\n I said. \"But I didn't go crazy\n with hate when I lost\nmy\nlegs.\"\n\n\n Ledman was sobbing.\n\n\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.\n Val got him into his suit, and\n brought him the fishbowl helmet.\n \"Get your helmet on and\n let's go. Between the psychs\n and the prosthetics men,\n you'll be a new man inside of\n a year.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a murderer!\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And you'll be\n sentenced to psych adjustment.\n When they're finished,\n Gregory Ledman the killer\n will be as dead as if they'd\n electrocuted you, but there'll\n be a new\u2014and sane\u2014Gregory\n Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\n\n\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\n\n\n For the first time since\n Ledman had caught us, I remembered\n how tired Val had\n been out on the desert. I realized\n now that I had been driving\n her mercilessly\u2014me, with\n my chromium legs and atomic-powered\n muscles. No wonder\n she was ready to fold!\n And I'd been too dense to see\n how unfair I had been.\n\n\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,\n and I put Ledman\n back in his wheelchair.\n\n\n Val slipped her oxymask\n back on and fastened it shut.\n\n\n \"Let's get back to the Dome\n in a hurry,\" I said. \"We'll\n turn Ledman over to the authorities.\n Then we can catch\n the next ship for Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Go back?\nGo back?\nIf you\n think I'm backing down now\n and quitting you can find\n yourself another wife! After\n we dump this guy I'm sacking\n in for twenty hours, and then\n we're going back out there to\n finish that search-pattern.\n Earth needs uranium, honey,\n and I know you'd never be\n happy quitting in the middle\n like that.\" She smiled. \"I\n can't wait to get out there\n and start listening for those\n tell-tale clicks.\"\n\n\n I gave a joyful whoop and\n swung her around. When I\n put her down, she squeezed\n my hand, hard.\n\n\n \"Let's get moving, fellow\n hero,\" she said.\n\n\n I pressed the stud for the\n airlock, smiling.\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAmazing Stories\nSeptember 1956.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
