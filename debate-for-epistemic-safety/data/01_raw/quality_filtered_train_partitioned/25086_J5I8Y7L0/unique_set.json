And all they got\n for their patience was the\n biggest surprise since David\n clobbered Goliath.\n\"\n Let\n me put it this way,\"\n Conners said paternally.\n \"We expect a certain amount of\n decorum from our Washington\n news correspondents, and that's\n all I'm asking for.\"\n\n\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the\n chair opposite his employer's\n desk, chewed on his knuckles\n and said nothing. One part of\n his mind wanted him to play it\n cagey, to behave the way the\n newspaper wanted him to behave,\n to protect the cozy Washington\n assignment he had waited\n four years to get. But another\n part of him, a rebel part,\n wanted him to stay on the trail\n of the story he felt sure was\n about to break.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean to make trouble,\n Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.\n \"It just seemed strange, all\n these exchanges of couriers in\n the past two days. I couldn't\n help thinking something was\n up.\"\n\n\n \"Even if that's true, we'll\n hear about it through the usual\n channels,\" Conners frowned.\n \"But getting a senator's secretary\n drunk to obtain information\u2014well,\n that's not only indiscreet,\n Bridges. It's downright\n dirty.\"\n\n\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn't take\nthat\nkind of advantage, Mr.\n Conners. Not that she wasn't a\n toothsome little dish ...\"\n\n\n \"Just thank your lucky stars\n that it didn't go any further.\n And from now on\u2014\" He waggled\n a finger at him. \"Watch\n your step.\"\n\n\n Jerry got up and ambled to the\n door. But he turned before leaving\n and said:\n\n\n \"By the way. What do\nyou\nthink is going on?\"\n\n\n \"I haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\n \"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners.\n Think it's war?\"\n\n\n \"That'll be all, Bridges.\"\nThe reporter closed the door\n behind him, and then strolled\n out of the building into the sunlight.\n\n\n He met Ruskin, the fat little\n AP correspondent, in front of\n the Pan-American Building on\n Constitution Avenue. Ruskin\n was holding the newspaper that\n contained the gossip-column\n item which had started the\n whole affair, and he seemed\n more interested in the romantic\n rather than political implications.\n As he walked beside him,\n he said:\n\n\n \"So what really happened,\n pal? That Greta babe really let\n down her hair?\"\n\n\n \"Where's your decorum?\"\n Jerry growled.\n\n\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she's\n quite a dame, all right. I think\n they ought to get the Secret\n Service to guard her. She really\n fills out a size 10, don't she?\"\n\n\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you\n have a low mind. For a week,\n this town has been acting like\n the\n39 Steps\n, and all you can\n think about is dames. What's\n the matter with you? Where\n will you be when the big mushroom\n cloud comes?\"\n\n\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin\n sighed. \"What a way to get\n radioactive.\"\n\n\n They split off a few blocks\n later, and Jerry walked until he\n came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;\n Grill, a favorite hangout of the\n local journalists. There were\n three other newsmen at the bar,\n and they gave him snickering\n greetings. He took a small table\n in the rear and ate his meal in\n sullen silence.\n\n\n It wasn't the newsmen's jibes\n that bothered him; it was the\n certainty that something of\n major importance was happening\n in the capitol. There had\n been hourly conferences at the\n White House, flying visits by\n State Department officials, mysterious\n conferences involving\n members of the Science Commission.\n So far, the byword\n had been secrecy. They knew\n that Senator Spocker, chairman\n of the Congressional Science\n Committee, had been involved\n in every meeting, but Senator\n Spocker was unavailable. His\n secretary, however, was a little\n more obliging ...\n\n\n Jerry looked up from his\n coffee and blinked when he saw\n who was coming through the\n door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did\n every other patron, but for different\n reasons. Greta Johnson\n had that effect upon men. Even\n the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored\n suit didn't hide\n her outrageously feminine qualities.\n\n\n She walked straight to his\n table, and he stood up.\n\n\n \"They told me you might be\n here,\" she said, breathing hard.\n \"I just wanted to thank you for\n last night.\"\n\n\n \"Look, Greta\u2014\"\nWham!\nHer hand, small and\n delicate, felt like a slab of lead\n when it slammed into his cheek.\n She left a bruise five fingers\n wide, and then turned and stalked\n out.\nHe ran after her, the restaurant\n proprietor shouting about\n the unpaid bill. It took a rapid\n dog-trot to reach her side.\n\n\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.\n \"You don't understand about\n last night. It wasn't the way\n that lousy columnist said\u2014\"\n\n\n She stopped in her tracks.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't have minded so\n much if you'd gotten me drunk.\n But to\nuse\nme, just to get a\n story\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a\nreporter\n, damn it.\n It's my job. I'd do it again if\n I thought you knew anything.\"\n\n\n She was pouting now. \"Well,\n how do you suppose I feel,\n knowing you're only interested\n in me because of the Senator?\n Anyway, I'll probably lose my\n job, and then you won't have\nany\nuse for me.\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said\n sadly.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you\n won't want to see me any more.\"\n\n\n \"Did I say that?\"\n\n\n \"It just won't be any use.\n We'll always have this thing between\n us.\"\n\n\n She looked at him for a moment,\n and then touched his\n bruised cheek with a tender,\n motherly gesture.\n\n\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,\n and then sighed. \"Oh,\n well. I guess there's no use\n fighting it. Maybe if I\ndid\ntell\n you what I know, we could act\nhuman\nagain.\"\n\n\n \"Greta!\"\n\n\n \"But if you print one\nword\nof it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never\n speak to you again!\"\n\n\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking\n her arm, \"you can trust me like\n a brother.\"\n\n\n \"That's\nnot\nthe idea,\" Greta\n said stiffly.\n\n\n In a secluded booth at the rear\n of a restaurant unfrequented by\n newsmen, Greta leaned forward\n and said:\n\n\n \"At first, they thought it was\n another sputnik.\"\n\n\n \"\nWho\ndid?\"\n\n\n \"The State Department, silly.\n They got reports from the observatories\n about another sputnik\n being launched by the Russians.\n Only the Russians denied\n it. Then there were joint meetings,\n and nobody could figure\n out\nwhat\nthe damn thing was.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said\n dizzily. \"You mean to tell me\n there's another of those metal\n moons up there?\"\n\n\n \"But it's not a moon. That's\n the big point. It's a spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A\nwhat\n?\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said\n coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They\n have been in contact with it now\n for about three days, and they're\n thinking of calling a plenary\n session of the UN just to figure\n out what to do about it. The\n only hitch is, Russia doesn't\n want to wait that long, and is\n asking for a hurry-up summit\n meeting to make a decision.\"\n\n\n \"A decision about what?\"\n\n\n \"About the Venusians, of\n course.\"\n\n\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I\n think you're still a little woozy\n from last night.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be silly. The spaceship's\n from Venus; they've already\n established that. And the\n people on it\u2014I\nguess\nthey're\n people\u2014want to know if they\n can land their delegate.\"\n\n\n \"Their what?\"\n\n\n \"Their delegate. They came\n here for some kind of conference,\n I guess. They know about\n the UN and everything, and\n they want to take part. They\n say that with all the satellites\n being launched, that our affairs\n are\ntheir\naffairs, too. It's kind\n of confusing, but that's what\n they say.\"\n\n\n \"You mean these Venusians\n speak English?\"\n\n\n \"And Russian. And French.\n And German. And everything I\n guess. They've been having\n radio talks with practically\n every country for the past three\n days. Like I say, they want to\n establish diplomatic relations\n or something. The Senator\n thinks that if we don't agree,\n they might do something drastic,\n like blow us all up. It's kind\n of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\n\n\n \"You're taking it mighty\n calm,\" he said ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, how else can I take it?\n I'm not even supposed to\nknow\nabout it, except that the Senator\n is so careless about\u2014\" She\n put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,\n dear, now you'll really think I'm\n terrible.\"\n\n\n \"Terrible? I think you're\n wonderful!\"\n\n\n \"And you promise not to print\n it?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I say I wouldn't?\"\n\n\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you're\n a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed\n that about you.\"\nThe press secretary's secretary,\n a massive woman with\n gray hair and impervious to\n charm, guarded the portals of\n his office with all the indomitable\n will of the U. S. Marines.\n But Jerry Bridges tried.\n\n\n \"You don't understand, Lana,\"\n he said. \"I don't want to\nsee\nMr.\n Howells. I just want you to\ngive\nhim something.\"\n\n\n \"My name's not Lana, and I\ncan't\ndeliver any messages.\"\n\n\n \"But this is something he\nwants\nto see.\" He handed her\n an envelope, stamped URGENT.\n \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll\n buy you the flashiest pair of\n diamond earrings in Washington.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the woman said,\n thawing slightly. \"I\ncould\ndeliver\n it with his next batch of mail.\"\n\n\n \"When will that be?\"\n\n\n \"In an hour. He's in a terribly\n important meeting right\n now.\"\n\n\n \"You've got some mail right\n there. Earrings and a bracelet\n to match.\"\n\n\n She looked at him with exasperation,\n and then gathered up\n a stack of memorandums and\n letters, his own envelope atop\n it. She came out of the press\n secretary's office two minutes\n later with Howells himself, and\n Howells said: \"You there,\n Bridges. Come in here.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\nsir\n!\" Jerry said, breezing\n by the waiting reporters\n with a grin of triumph.\n\n\n There were six men in the\n room, three in military uniform.\n Howells poked the envelope towards\n Jerry, and snapped:\n\n\n \"This note of yours. Just what\n do you think it means?\"\n\n\n \"You know better than I do,\n Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my\n job; I think the public has a\n right to know about this spaceship\n that's flying around\u2014\"\nHis words brought an exclamation\n from the others. Howells\n sighed, and said:\n\n\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don't make\n it easy for us. It's our opinion\n that secrecy is essential, that\n leakage of the story might cause\n panic. Since you're the only unauthorized\n person who knows of\n it, we have two choices. One of\n them is to lock you up.\"\n\n\n Jerry swallowed hard.\n\n\n \"The other is perhaps more\n practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll\n be taken into our confidence, and\n allowed to accompany those officials\n who will be admitted to the\n landing site. But you will\nnot\nbe\n allowed to relay the story to the\n press until such a time as\nall\ncorrespondents are informed.\n That won't give you a 'scoop' if\n that's what you call it, but you'll\n be an eyewitness. That should\n be worth something.\"\n\n\n \"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said\n eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me, I'm not doing\n you any\npersonal\nfavor. Now\n about the landing tonight\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean the spaceship's\n coming down?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers\n conference was held this\n morning, and a decision was\n reached to accept the delegate.\n Landing instructions are being\n given at Los Alamos, and the\n ship will presumably land\n around midnight tonight. There\n will be a jet leaving Washington\n Airport at nine, and you'll be\n on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself\n in custody.\"\nThe USAF jet transport\n wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded\n aircraft that took off that evening\n from Washington Airport.\n But Jerry Bridges, sitting in\n the rear seat flanked by two\n Sphinx-like Secret Service men,\n knew that he was the only passenger\n with non-official status\n aboard.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes\n past ten when they arrived at\n the air base at Los Alamos. The\n desert sky was cloudy and starless,\n and powerful searchlights\n probed the thick cumulus. There\n were sleek, purring black autos\n waiting to rush the air passengers\n to some unnamed destination.\n They drove for twenty\n minutes across a flat ribbon of\n desert road, until Jerry sighted\n what appeared to be a circle of\n newly-erected lights in the middle\n of nowhere. On the perimeter,\n official vehicles were parked\n in orderly rows, and four USAF\n trailer trucks were in evidence,\n their radarscopes turning slowly.\n There was activity everywhere,\n but it was well-ordered\n and unhurried. They had done a\n good job of keeping the excitement\n contained.\n\n\n He was allowed to leave the\n car and stroll unescorted. He\n tried to talk to some of the\n scurrying officials, but to no\n avail. Finally, he contented\n himself by sitting on the sand,\n his back against the grill of a\n staff car, smoking one cigarette\n after another.\n\n\n As the minutes ticked off, the\n activity became more frenetic\n around him. Then the pace slowed,\n and he knew the appointed\n moment was approaching. Stillness\n returned to the desert, and\n tension was a tangible substance\n in the night air.\n\n\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\n\n\n The searchlights converged\n in an intricate pattern.\n\n\n Then the clouds seemed to\n part!\n\n\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice\n shouted. And in a moment, the\n calm was shattered. At first, he\n saw nothing. A faint roar was\n started in the heavens, and it\n became a growl that increased\n in volume until even the shouting\n voices could no longer be\n heard. Then the crisscrossing\n lights struck metal, glancing off\n the gleaming body of a descending\n object. Larger and larger\n the object grew, until it assumed\n the definable shape of a squat\n silver funnel, falling in a perfect\n straight line towards the center\n of the light-ringed area. When it\n hit, a dust cloud obscured it from\n sight.\nA loudspeaker blared out an\n unintelligible order, but its message\n was clear. No one moved\n from their position.\n\n\n Finally, a three-man team,\n asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped\n out from the ring of spectators.\n They carried geiger counters\n on long poles before them.\n\n\n Jerry held his breath as they\n approached the object; only\n when they were yards away did\n he appreciate its size. It wasn't\n large; not more than fifteen feet\n in total circumference.\n\n\n One of the three men waved\n a gloved hand.\n\n\n \"It's okay,\" a voice breathed\n behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\n\n\n Slowly, the ring of spectators\n closed tighter. They were twenty\n yards from the ship when the\n voice spoke to them.\n\n\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it\n said, and then repeated the\n phrase in six languages. \"The\n ship you see is a Venusian Class\n 7 interplanetary rocket, built\n for one-passenger. It is clear of\n all radiation, and is perfectly\n safe to approach. There is a\n hatch which may be opened by\n an automatic lever in the side.\n Please open this hatch and remove\n the passenger.\"\n\n\n An Air Force General whom\n Jerry couldn't identify stepped\n forward. He circled the ship\n warily, and then said something\n to the others. They came closer,\n and he touched a small lever on\n the silvery surface of the funnel.\n\n\n A door slid open.\n\n\n \"It's a box!\" someone said.\n\n\n \"A crate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!\n Lend a hand here\u2014\"\n\n\n A trio came forward and\n hoisted the crate out of the ship.\n Then the voice spoke again;\n Jerry deduced that it must have\n been activated by the decreased\n load of the ship.\n\n\n \"Please open the crate. You\n will find our delegate within.\n We trust you will treat him\n with the courtesy of an official\n emissary.\"\n\n\n They set to work on the crate,\n its gray plastic material giving\n in readily to the application of\n their tools. But when it was\n opened, they stood aside in\n amazement and consternation.\n\n\n There were a variety of metal\n pieces packed within, protected\n by a filmy packing material.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general\n said. \"Here's a book\u2014\"\n\n\n He picked up a gray-bound\n volume, and opened its cover.\n\n\n \"'Instructions for assembling\n Delegate,'\" he read aloud.\n \"'First, remove all parts and\n arrange them in the following\n order. A-1, central nervous system\n housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked\n up. \"It's an instruction book,\"\n he whispered. \"We're supposed\n to\nbuild\nthe damn thing.\"\nThe Delegate, a handsomely\n constructed robot almost eight\n feet tall, was pieced together\n some three hours later, by a\n team of scientists and engineers\n who seemed to find the Venusian\n instructions as elementary as a\n blueprint in an Erector set. But\n simple as the job was, they were\n obviously impressed by the\n mechanism they had assembled.\n It stood impassive until they\n obeyed the final instruction.\n \"Press Button K ...\"\n\n\n They found button K, and\n pressed it.\n\n\n The robot bowed.\n\n\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it\n said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.\n \"Now if you will please\n escort me to the meeting\n place ...\"\nIt wasn't until three days\n after the landing that Jerry\n Bridges saw the Delegate again.\n Along with a dozen assorted\n government officials, Army officers,\n and scientists, he was\n quartered in a quonset hut in\n Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,\n after seventy-two frustrating\n hours, he was escorted by Marine\n guard into New York City.\n No one told him his destination,\n and it wasn't until he saw the\n bright strips of light across the\n face of the United Nations\n building that he knew where the\n meeting was to be held.\n\n\n But his greatest surprise was\n yet to come. The vast auditorium\n which housed the general\n assembly was filled to its capacity,\n but there were new faces\n behind the plaques which designated\n the member nations.\n He couldn't believe his eyes at\n first, but as the meeting got\n under way, he knew that it was\n true. The highest echelons of the\n world's governments were represented,\n even\u2014Jerry gulped\n at the realization\u2014Nikita Khrushchev\n himself. It was a summit\n meeting such as he had never\n dreamed possible, a summit\n meeting without benefit of long\n foreign minister's debate. And\n the cause of it all, a placid,\n highly-polished metal robot, was\n seated blithely at a desk which\n bore the designation:\nVENUS.\n\n\n The robot delegate stood up.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the\n microphone, and the great men\n at the council tables strained to\n hear the translator's version\n through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,\n I thank you for your\n prompt attention. I come as a\n Delegate from a great neighbor\n planet, in the interests of peace\n and progress for all the solar\n system. I come in the belief that\n peace is the responsibility of individuals,\n of nations, and now\n of worlds, and that each is dependent\n upon the other. I speak\n to you now through the electronic\n instrumentation which\n has been created for me, and I\n come to offer your planet not\n merely a threat, a promise, or\n an easy solution\u2014but a challenge.\"\n\n\n The council room stirred.\n\n\n \"Your earth satellites have\n been viewed with interest by the\n astronomers of our world, and\n we foresee the day when contact\n between our planets will be commonplace.\n As for ourselves, we\n have hitherto had little desire\n to explore beyond our realm,\n being far too occupied with internal\n matters. But our isolation\n cannot last in the face of\n your progress, so we believe that\n we must take part in your\n affairs.\n\n\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.\n Continue your struggle of ideas,\n compete with each other for the\n minds of men, fight your bloodless\n battles, if you know no\n other means to attain progress.\n But do all this\nwithout\nunleashing\n the terrible forces of power\n now at your command. Once\n unleashed, these forces may or\n may not destroy all that you\n have gained. But we, the scientists\n of Venus, promise you this\u2014that\n on the very day your conflict\n deteriorates into heedless\n violence, we will not stand by\n and let the ugly contagion\n spread. On that day, we of\n Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,\n and relentlessly\u2014to destroy\n your world completely.\"\n\n\n Again, the meeting room exploded\n in a babble of languages.\n\n\n \"The vessel which brought me\n here came as a messenger of\n peace. But envision it, men of\n Earth, as a messenger of war.\n Unstoppable, inexorable, it may\n return, bearing a different Delegate\n from Venus\u2014a Delegate of\n Death, who speaks not in words,\n but in the explosion of atoms.\n Think of thousands of such Delegates,\n fired from a vantage\n point far beyond the reach of\n your retaliation. This is the\n promise and the challenge that\n will hang in your night sky from\n this moment forward. Look at\n the planet Venus, men of Earth,\n and see a Goddess of Vengeance,\n poised to wreak its wrath upon\n those who betray the peace.\"\n\n\n The Delegate sat down.\nFour days later, a mysterious\n explosion rocked the quiet sands\n of Los Alamos, and the Venus\n spacecraft was no more. Two\n hours after that, the robot delegate,\n its message delivered, its\n mission fulfilled, requested to be\n locked inside a bombproof\n chamber. When the door was\n opened, the Delegate was an exploded\n ruin.\n\n\n The news flashed with lightning\n speed over the world, and\n Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts\n of the incredible event\n was syndicated throughout the\n nation. But his sudden celebrity\n left him vaguely unsatisfied.\n\n\n He tried to explain his feeling\n to Greta on his first night back\n in Washington. They were in his\n apartment, and it was the first\n time Greta had consented to pay\n him the visit.\n\n\n \"Well, what's\nbothering\nyou?\"\n Greta pouted. \"You've had the\n biggest story of the year under\n your byline. I should think you'd\n be tickled pink.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that,\" Jerry said\n moodily. \"But ever since I heard\n the Delegate speak, something's\n been nagging me.\"\n\n\n \"But don't you think he's done\n good? Don't you think they'll be\n impressed by what he said?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not worried about that.\n I think that damn robot did\n more for peace than anything\n that's ever come along in this\n cockeyed world. But still ...\"\n\n\n Greta snuggled up to him on\n the sofa. \"You worry too much.\n Don't you ever think of anything\n else? You should learn to\n relax. It can be fun.\"\n\n\n She started to prove it to him,\n and Jerry responded the way a\n normal, healthy male usually\n does. But in the middle of an\n embrace, he cried out:\n\n\n \"Wait a minute!\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n \"I just thought of something!\n Now where the hell did I put\n my old notebooks?\"\n\n\n He got up from the sofa and\n went scurrying to a closet. From\n a debris of cardboard boxes, he\n found a worn old leather brief\n case, and cackled with delight\n when he found the yellowed\n notebooks inside.\n\n\n \"What\nare\nthey?\" Greta said.\n\n\n \"My old school notebooks.\n Greta, you'll have to excuse me.\n But there's something I've got\n to do, right away!\"\n\n\n \"That's all right with me,\"\n Greta said haughtily. \"I know\n when I'm not wanted.\"\n\n\n She took her hat and coat from\n the hall closet, gave him one\n last chance to change his mind,\n and then left.\n\n\n Five minutes later, Jerry\n Bridges was calling the airlines.\nIt had been eleven years since\n Jerry had walked across the\n campus of Clifton University,\n heading for the ivy-choked\n main building. It was remarkable\n how little had changed, but\n the students seemed incredibly\n young. He was winded by the\n time he asked the pretty girl at\n the desk where Professor Martin\n Coltz could be located.\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck\n a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I\n guess he'd be in the Holland\n Laboratory about now.\"\n\n\n \"Holland Laboratory? What's\n that?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I guess that was after\n your time, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed\n to say: \"It must be something\n new since I was here.\n Where is this place?\"\n\n\n He followed her directions,\n and located a fresh-painted\n building three hundred yards\n from the men's dorm. He met a\n student at the door, who told\n him that Professor Coltz would\n be found in the physics department.\n\n\n The room was empty when\n Jerry entered, except for the\n single stooped figure vigorously\n erasing a blackboard. He turned\n when the door opened. If the\n students looked younger, Professor\n Coltz was far older than\n Jerry remembered. He was a\n tall man, with an unruly confusion\n of straight gray hair. He\n blinked when Jerry said:\n\n\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember\n me? Jerry Bridges?\"\n\n\n \"Of course! I thought of you\n only yesterday, when I saw your\n name in the papers\u2014\"\n\n\n They sat at facing student\n desks, and chatted about old\n times. But Jerry was impatient\n to get to the point of his visit,\n and he blurted out:\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz, something's\n been bothering me. It bothered\n me from the moment I heard\n the Delegate speak. I didn't\n know what it was until last\n night, when I dug out my old\n college notebooks. Thank God\n I kept them.\"\n\n\n Coltz's eyes were suddenly\n hooded.\n\n\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"There was something about\n the Robot's speech that sounded\n familiar\u2014I could have sworn\n I'd heard some of the words\n before. I couldn't prove anything\n until I checked my old\n notes, and here's what I found.\"\n\n\n He dug into his coat pocket\n and produced a sheet of paper.\n He unfolded it and read aloud.\n\n\n \"'It's my belief that peace is\n the responsibility of individuals,\n of nations, and someday, even of\n worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\n\n\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.\n \"I don't recall every silly thing\n I said, Jerry.\"\n\n\n \"But it's an interesting coincidence,\n isn't it, Professor?\n These very words were spoken\n by the Delegate from Venus.\"\n\n\n \"A coincidence\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is it? But I also remember\n your interest in robotics. I'll\n never forget that mechanical\n homing pigeon you constructed.\n And you've probably learned\n much more these past eleven\n years.\"\n\n\n \"What are you driving at,\n Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a\n little daydream, recently, and I\n want you to hear it. I dreamed\n about a group of teachers, scientists,\n and engineers, a group\n who were suddenly struck by\n an exciting, incredible idea. A\n group that worked in the quiet\n and secrecy of a University on a\n fantastic scheme to force the\n idea of peace into the minds of\n the world's big shots. Does my\n dream interest you, Professor?\"\n\n\n \"Go on.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I dreamt that this\n group would secretly launch an\n earth satellite of their own, and\n arrange for the nose cone to\n come down safely at a certain\n time and place. They would install\n a marvelous electronic robot\n within the cone, ready to be\n assembled. They would beam a\n radio message to earth from the\n cone, seemingly as if it originated\n from their 'spaceship.'\n Then, when the Robot was assembled,\n they would speak\n through it to demand peace for\n all mankind ...\"\n\n\n \"Jerry, if you do this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to say it,\n Professor, I know what you're\n thinking. I'm a reporter, and my\n business is to tell the world\n everything I know. But if I\n did it, there might not be a\n world for me to write about,\n would there? No, thanks, Professor.\n As far as I'm concerned,\n what I told you was nothing\n more than a daydream.\"\nJerry braked the convertible\n to a halt, and put his arm\n around Greta's shoulder. She\n looked up at the star-filled night,\n and sighed romantically.\n\n\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\n\n\n Greta shivered closer to him.\n\n\n \"And to think what that terrible\n planet can do to us!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also\n the Goddess of Love.\"\n\n\n He swung his other arm\n around her, and Venus winked\n approvingly.\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\nOctober 1958.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
