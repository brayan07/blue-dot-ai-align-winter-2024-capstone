  "article": "MUTINEER\nBy ROBERT J. SHEA\nFor every weapon there was a defense, but not against\n the deadliest weapon\u2014man himself!\nRaging\n , Trooper Lane\n hovered three thousand\n feet above Tammany Square.\n\n\n The cool cybrain surgically\n implanted in him was working\n on the problem. But Lane\n had no more patience. They'd\n sweat, he thought, hating the\n chill air-currents that threw\n his hovering body this way\n and that. He glared down at\n the three towers bordering on\n the Square. He spat, and\n watched the little white speck\n fall, fall.\nLock me up in barracks.\n All I wanted was a\n little time off. Did I fight in\n Chi for them? Damn right I\n did. Just a little time off, so\n I shouldn't blow my top. Now\n the lid's gone.\nHe was going over all their\n heads. He'd bowled those city\n cops over like paper dolls,\n back at the Armory. The\n black dog was on Lane's back.\n Old Mayor himself was going\n to hear about it.\nWhy not? Ain't old Mayor\n the CinC of the Newyork\n Troopers?\nThe humming paragrav-paks\n embedded beneath his\n shoulder blades held him\n motionless above Newyork's\n three administrative towers.\n Tammany Hall. Mayor's Palace.\n Court House. Lane cursed\n his stupidity. He hadn't found\n out which one was which\n ahead of time.\nThey keep\n Troopers in the Armory and\n teach them how to fight. They\n don't teach them about their\n own city, that they'll be fighting\n for. There's no time. From\n seven years old up, Troopers\n have too much to learn about\n fighting.\nThe Mayor was behind one\n of those thousands of windows.\n\n\n Old cybrain, a gift from the\n Trooper surgeons, compliments\n of the city, would have\n to figure out which one. Blood\n churned in his veins, nerves\n shrieked with impatience.\n Lane waited for the electronic\n brain to come up with the answer.\n\n\n Then his head jerked up, to\n a distant buzz. There were\n cops coming. Two black paragrav-boats\n whirred along the\n translucent underside of Newyork's\n anti-missile force-shield,\n the Shell.\nOld cybrain better be fast.\n Damn fast!\nThe cybrain jolted an impulse\n through his spine. Lane\n somersaulted. Cybrain had\n taken charge of his motor\n nerves. Lane's own mind was\n just along for the ride.\nHis\n body snapped into a\n stiff dive position. He began\n to plummet down, picking\n up speed. His mailed hands\n glittered like arrowheads out\n in front. They pointed to a\n particular window in one of\n the towers. A predatory excitement\n rippled through him\n as he sailed down through the\n air. It was like going into\n battle again. A little red-white-and-green\n flag fluttered\n on a staff below the window.\n Whose flag? The city flag was\n orange and blue. He shrugged\n away the problem. Cybrain\n knew what it was doing.\n\n\n The little finger of his right\n hand vibrated in its metal\n sheath. A pale vibray leaped\n from the lensed fingertip.\n Breakthrough! The glasstic\n pane dissolved. Lane streamed\n through the window.\n\n\n The paragrav-paks cut off.\n Lane dropped lightly to the\n floor, inside the room, in battle-crouch.\n A 3V set was yammering.\n A girl screamed. Lane's\n hand shot out automatically.\n A finger vibrated. Out of the\n corner of his eye, Lane saw\n the girl fold to the floor. There\n was no one else in the room.\n Lane, still in a crouch, chewed\n his lip.\nThe Mayor?\nHis head swung around and\n he peered at the 3V set. He\n saw his own face.\n\n\n \"Lashing police with his\n vibray,\" said the announcer,\n \"Lane broke through the cordon\n surrounding Manhattan\n Armory. Two policemen were\n killed, four others seriously\n injured. Tammany Hall has\n warned that this man is extremely\n dangerous. Citizens\n are cautioned to keep clear of\n him. Lane is an insane killer.\n He is armed with the latest\n military weapons. A built-in\n electronic brain controls his\n reflexes\u2014\"\n\n\n \"At ease with that jazz,\"\n said Lane, and a sheathed finger\n snapped out. There was a\n loud bang. The 3V screen dissolved\n into a puddle of glasstic.\nThe Mayor.\nLane strode to the window.\n The two police boats were\n hovering above the towers.\n Lane's mailed hand snapped\n open a pouch at his belt. He\n flipped a fist-sized cube to the\n floor.\n\n\n The force-bomb \"exploded\"\u2014swelled\n or inflated, really,\n but with the speed of a blast.\n Lane glanced out the window.\n A section of the energy globe\n bellied out from above. It\n shaded the view from his window\n and re-entered the tower\n wall just below.\n\n\n Now the girl.\n\n\n He turned back to the room.\n \"Wake up, outa-towner.\" He\n gave the blonde girl a light\n dose of the vibray to slap her\n awake.\n\n\n \"Who are you?\" she said,\n shakily.\n\n\n Lane grinned. \"Trooper\n Lane, of the Newyork Special\n Troops, is all.\" He threw her\n a mock salute. \"You from\n outa-town, girlie. I ain't seen\n a Newyork girl with yellow\n hair in years. Orange or\n green is the action. Whatcha\n doing in the Mayor's room?\"\nThe\n girl pushed herself to\n her feet. Built, Lane saw.\n She was pretty and clean-looking,\n very out-of-town. She\n held herself straight and her\n blue-violet eyes snapped at\n him.\n\n\n \"What the devil do you\n think you're doing, soldier? I\n am a diplomat of the Grassroots\n Republic of Mars. This\n is an embassy, if you know\n what that means.\"\n\n\n \"I don't,\" said Lane, unconcerned.\n\n\n \"Well, you should have had\n brains enough to honor the\n flag outside this window.\n That's the Martian flag, soldier.\n If you've never heard of\n diplomatic immunity, you'll\n suffer for your ignorance.\"\n Her large, dark eyes narrowed.\n \"Who sent you?\"\n\n\n \"My cybrain sent me.\"\n\n\n She went openmouthed.\n \"You're\nLane\n.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the guy they told you\n about on the 3V. Where's the\n Mayor? Ain't this his place?\"\n\n\n \"No. No, you're in the\n wrong room. The wrong building.\n That's the Mayor's suite\n over there.\" She pointed. \"See\n where the balcony is? This is\n the Embassy suite. If you\n want the Mayor you'll have to\n go over there.\"\n\n\n \"Whaddaya know,\" said\n Lane. \"Cybrain didn't know,\n no more than me.\"\n\n\n The girl noticed the dark\n swell of the force-globe.\n \"What's that out there?\"\n\n\n \"Force-screen. Nothing gets\n past, except maybe a full-size\n blaster-beam. Keeps cops out.\n Keeps you in. You anybody\n important?\"\n\n\n \"I told you, I'm an ambassador.\n From Mars. I'm on a\n diplomatic mission.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah? Mars a big city?\"\n\n\n She stared at him, violet\n eyes wide. \"The\nplanet\nMars.\"\n\n\n \"Planet? Oh,\nthat\nMars.\n Sure, I've heard of it\u2014you\n gotta go by spaceship. What's\n your name?\"\n\n\n \"Gerri Kin. Look, Lane,\n holding me is no good. It'll\n just get you in worse trouble.\n What are you trying to do?\"\n\n\n \"I wanna see the Mayor. Me\n and my buddies, we just come\n back from fighting in Chi,\n Gerri. We won. They got a\n new Mayor out there in Chi.\n He takes orders from Newyork.\"\n\n\n Gerri Kin said, \"That's\n what the force-domes did. The\n perfect defense. But also the\n road to the return to city-states.\n Anarchy.\"\n\n\n Lane said, \"Yeah? Well, we\n done what they wanted us to\n do. We did the fighting for\n them. So we come back home\n to Newyork and they lock us\n up in the Armory. Won't pay\n us. Won't let us go nowhere.\n They had cops guarding us.\n City cops.\" Lane sneered. \"I\n busted out. I wanna see the\n Mayor and find out why we\n can't have time off. I don't\n play games, Gerri. I go right\n to the top.\"\n\n\n Lane broke off. There was\n a hum outside the window. He\n whirled and stared out. The\n rounded black hulls of the two\n police paragrav-boats were\n nosing toward the force-screen.\n Lane could read the\n white numbers painted on\n their bows.\n\n\n A loudspeaker shouted into\n the room: \"Come out of there,\n Lane, or we'll blast you out.\"\n\n\n \"You can't,\" Lane called.\n \"This girl from Mars is here.\"\n\n\n \"I repeat, Lane\u2014come out\n or we'll blast you out.\"\n\n\n Lane turned to the girl. \"I\n thought you were important.\"\nShe\n stood there with her\n hands together, calmly\n looking at him. \"I am. But\n you are too, to them. Mars is\n millions of miles away, and\n you're right across the Square\n from the Mayor's suite.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, but\u2014\" Lane shook\n his head and turned back to\n the window. \"All right, look!\n Move them boats away and\n I'll let this girl out!\"\n\n\n \"No deal, Lane. We're coming\n in.\" The police boats\n backed away slowly, then shot\n straight up, out of the line of\n vision.\n\n\n Lane looked down at the\n Square. Far below, the long,\n gleaming barrel of a blaster\n cannon caught the dim light\n filtering down through Newyork's\n Shell. The cannon trundled\n into the Square on its\n olive-drab, box-shaped caterpillar\n mounting and took up a\n position equidistant from the\n bases of the three towers.\n\n\n Now a rumble of many\n voices rose from below. Lane\n stared down to see a large\n crowd gathering in Tammany\n Square. Sound trucks were\n rolling to a stop around the\n edges of the crowd. The people\n were all looking up.\n\n\n Lane looked across the\n Square. The windows of the\n tower opposite, the ones he\n could see clearly, were crowded\n with faces. There were\n white dot faces on the balcony\n that Gerri Kin had pointed\n out as the Mayor's suite.\n\n\n The voice of a 3V newscaster\n rolled up from the Square,\n reechoing against the tower\n walls.\n\n\n \"Lane is holding the Martian\n Ambassador, Gerri Kin,\n hostage. You can see the Martian\n tricolor behind his force-globe.\n Police are bringing up\n blaster cannon. Lane's defense\n is a globe of energy\n similar to the one which protects\n Newyork from aerial attack.\"\n\n\n Lane grinned back at Gerri\n Kin. \"Whole town's down\n there.\" Then his grin faded.\n Nice-looking, nice-talking girl\n like this probably cared a lot\n more about dying than he did.\n Why the hell didn't they give\n him a chance to let her out?\n Maybe he could do it now.\n\n\n Cybrain said no. It said the\n second he dropped his force-screen,\n they'd blast this room\n to hell. Poor girl from Mars,\n she didn't have a chance.\n\n\n Gerri Kin put her hand to\n her forehead. \"Why did you\n have to pick my room? Why\n did they send me to this crazy\n city? Private soldiers. Twenty\n million people living under\n a Shell like worms in a corpse.\n Earth is sick and it's going to\n kill me. What's going to happen?\"\n\n\n Lane looked sadly at her.\n Only two kinds of girls ever\n went near a Trooper\u2014the\n crazy ones and the ones the\n city paid. Why did he have to\n be so near getting killed when\n he met one he liked? Now that\n she was showing a little less\n fear and anger, she was talking\n straight to him. She was\n good, but she wasn't acting as\n if she was too good for him.\n\n\n \"They'll start shooting pretty\n quick,\" said Lane. \"I'm\n sorry about you.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I could write a letter\n to my parents,\" she said.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you understand\n what I said?\"\n\n\n \"What's a letter?\"\n\n\n \"You don't know where\n Mars is. You don't know what\n a letter is. You probably can't\n even read and write!\"\nLane\n shrugged. He carried\n on the conversation disinterestedly,\n professionally relaxed\n before battle. \"What's\n these things I can't do? They\n important?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. The more I see of this\n city and its people, the more\n important I realize they are.\n You know how to fight, don't\n you? I'll bet you're perfect\n with those weapons.\"\n\n\n \"Listen. They been training\n me to fight since I was a little\n kid. Why shouldn't I be a\n great little fighter?\"\n\n\n \"Specialization,\" said the\n girl from Mars.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Specialization. Everyone\n I've met in this city is a specialist.\n SocioSpecs run the\n government. TechnoSpecs run\n the machinery. Troopers fight\n the wars. And ninety per cent\n of the people don't work at all\n because they're not trained to\n do anything.\"\n\n\n \"The Fans,\" said Lane.\n \"They got it soft. That's them\n down there, come to watch the\n fight.\"\n\n\n \"You know why you were\n kept in the Armory, Lane? I\n heard them talking about it,\n at the dinner I went to last\n night.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because they're afraid of\n the Troopers. You men did too\n good a job out in Chi. You are\n the deadliest weapon that has\n ever been made. You. Single\n airborne infantrymen!\"\n\n\n Lane said, \"They told us in\n Trooper Academy that it's the\n men that win the wars.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but people had forgotten\n it until the SocioSpecs of\n Newyork came up with the\n Troopers. Before the Troopers,\n governments concentrated\n on the big weapons, the\n missiles, the bombs. And the\n cities, with the Shells, were\n safe from bombs. They learned\n to be self-sufficient under\n the Shells. They were so safe,\n so isolated, that national governments\n collapsed. But you\n Troopers wiped out that feeling\n of security, when you infiltrated\n Chi and conquered\n it.\"\n\n\n \"We scared them, huh?\"\n\n\n Gerri said, \"You scared\n them so much that they were\n afraid to let you have a furlough\n in the city when you\n came back. Afraid you Troopers\n would realize that you\n could easily take over the city\n if you wanted to. You scared\n them so much that they'll let\n me be killed. They'll actually\n risk trouble with Mars just to\n kill you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry about you. I\n mean it, I like\u2014\"\n\n\n At that moment a titanic,\n ear-splitting explosion hurled\n him to the carpet, deafened\n and blinded him.\n\n\n He recovered and saw Gerri\n a few feet away, dazed, groping\n on hands and knees.\n\n\n Lane jumped to the window,\n looked quickly, sprang\n back. Cybrain pumped orders\n to his nervous system.\n\n\n \"Blaster cannon,\" he said.\n \"But just one. Gotcha, cybrain.\n I can beat that.\"\n\n\n He picked up the black box\n that generated his protective\n screen. Snapping it open with\n thumb-pressure, he turned a\n small dial. Then he waited.\n\n\n Again an enormous, brain-shattering\n concussion.\n\n\n Again Lane and Gerri were\n thrown to the floor. But this\n time there was a second explosion\n and a blinding flash\n from below.\n\n\n Lane laughed boyishly and\n ran to the window.\n\n\n \"Look!\" he called to Gerri.\nThere\n was a huge gap in\n the crowd below. The\n pavement was blackened and\n shattered to rubble. In and\n around the open space\n sprawled dozens of tiny black\n figures, not moving.\n\n\n \"Backfire,\" said Lane. \"I set\n the screen to throw their\n blaster beam right back at\n them.\"\n\n\n \"And they knew you might\u2014and\n yet they let a crowd\n congregate!\"\n\n\n Gerri reeled away from the\n window, sick.\n\n\n Lane said, \"I can do that a\n couple times more, but it\n burns out the force-globe.\n Then I'm dead.\"\n\n\n He heard the 3V newscaster's\n amplified voice: \"\u2014approximately\n fifty killed. But\n Lane is through now. He has\n been able to outthink police\n with the help of his cybrain.\n Now police are feeding the\n problem to their giant analogue\n computer in the sub-basement\n of the Court House.\n The police analogue computer\n will be able to outthink Lane's\n cybrain, will predict Lane's\n moves in advance. Four more\n blaster cannon are coming\n down Broadway\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Why don't they clear those\n people out of the Square?\"\n Gerri cried.\n\n\n \"What? Oh, the Fans\u2014nobody\n clears them out.\" He\n paused. \"I got one more\n chance to try.\" He raised a\n mailed glove to his mouth and\n pressed a small stud in the\n wrist. He said, \"Trooper HQ,\n this is Lane.\"\n\n\n A voice spoke in his helmet.\n \"Lane, this is Trooper\n HQ. We figured you'd call.\"\n\n\n \"Get me Colonel Klett.\"\n\n\n Thirty seconds passed. Lane\n could hear the clank of caterpillar\n treads as the mobile\n blaster cannon rolled into\n Tammany Square.\n\n\n The voice of the commanding\n officer of the Troopers\n rasped into Lane's ear:\n \"Meat-head! You broke out\n against my orders!\nNow\nlook\n at you!\"\n\n\n \"I knew you didn't mean\n them orders, sir.\"\n\n\n \"If you get out of there\n alive, I'll hang you for disobeying\n them!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Sir, there's a girl\n here\u2014somebody important\u2014from\n Mars. You know, the\n planet. Sir, she told me we\n could take over the city if we\n got loose. That right, sir?\"\n\n\n There was a pause. \"Your\n girl from Mars is right, Lane.\n But it's too late now. If we\n had moved first, captured the\n city government, we might\n have done it. But they're\n ready for us. They'd chop us\n down with blaster cannon.\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm asking for help. I\n know you're on my side.\"\n\n\n \"I am, Lane.\" The voice of\n Colonel Klett was lower. \"I'd\n never admit it if you had a\n chance of getting out of there\n alive. You've had it, son. I'd\n only lose more men trying to\n rescue you. When they feed\n the data into that analogue\n computer, you're finished.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Lane.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Over and out.\"\n\n\n Lane pressed the stud on\n his gauntlet again. He turned\n to Gerri.\n\n\n \"You're okay. I wish I\n could let you out. Old cybrain\n says I can't. Says if I drop the\n force-globe for a second,\n they'll fire into the room, and\n then we'll both be dead.\"\nGerri\n stood with folded\n arms and looked at him.\n \"Do what you have to do. As\n far as I can see, you're the\n only person in this city that\n has even a little bit of right\n on his side.\"\n\n\n Lane laughed. \"Any of them\n purple-haired broads I know\n would be crazy scared. You're\n different.\"\n\n\n \"When my grandparents\n landed on Mars, they found\n out that selfishness was a luxury.\n Martians can't afford\n it.\"\n\n\n Lane frowned with the effort\n of thinking. \"You said I\n had a little right on my side.\n That's a good feeling. Nobody\n ever told me to feel that way\n about myself before. It'll be\n better to die knowing that.\"\n\n\n \"I know,\" she said.\n\n\n The amplified voice from\n below said, \"The police analogue\n computer is now hooked\n directly to the controls of the\n blaster cannon battery. It will\n outguess Lane's cybrain and\n check his moves ahead of\n time.\"\n\n\n Lane looked at Gerri. \"How\n about giving me a kiss before\n they get us? Be nice if I kissed\n a girl like you just once in\n my life.\"\n\n\n She smiled and walked forward.\n \"You deserve it, Lane.\"\n\n\n He kissed her and it filled\n him with longings for things\n he couldn't name. Then he\n stepped back and shook his\n head. \"It ain't right you\n should get killed. If I take a\n dive out that window, they\n shoot at me, not in here.\"\n\n\n \"And kill you all the sooner.\"\n\n\n \"Better than getting burned\n up in this lousy little room.\n You also got right on your\n side. There's too many damn\n Troopers and not enough good\n persons like you. Old cybrain\n says stay here, but I don't\n guess I will. I'm gonna pay\n you back for that kiss.\"\n\n\n \"But you're safe in here!\"\n\n\n \"Worry about yourself, not\n about me.\" Lane picked up the\n force-bomb and handed it to\n her. \"When I say now, press\n this. Then take your hand off,\n real fast. It'll shut off the\n screen for a second.\"\n\n\n He stepped up on to the\n window ledge. Automatically,\n the cybrain cut in his paragrav-paks.\n \"So long, outa-towner.\nNow!\n\"\n\n\n He jumped. He was hurtling\n across the Square when the\n blaster cannons opened up.\n They weren't aimed at the\n window where the little red-white-and-green\n tricolor was\n flying. But they weren't aimed\n at Lane, either. They were\n shooting wild.\nWhich way now? Looks\n like I got a chance. Old cybrain\n says fly right for the\n cannons.\nHe saw the Mayor's balcony\n ahead.\nGo to hell, old cybrain.\n I'm doing all right by myself.\n I come to see the Mayor, and\n I'm gonna see him.\nLane plunged forward. He\n heard the shouts of frightened\n men.\n\n\n He swooped over the balcony\n railing. A man was\n pointing a blaster pistol at\n him. There were five men\n on the balcony\u2014emergency!\n Years of training and cybrain\n took over. Lane's hand shot\n out, fingers vibrating. As he\n dropped to the balcony floor in\n battle-crouch, the men slumped\n around him.\n\n\n He had seen the man with\n the blaster pistol before. It\n was the Mayor of Newyork.\n\n\n Lane stood for a moment in\n the midst of the sprawled\n men, the shrieks of the crowd\n floating up to him. Then he\n raised his glove to his lips. He\n made contact with Manhattan\n Armory.\n\n\n \"Colonel Klett, sir. You\n said if we captured the city\n government we might have a\n chance. Well, I captured the\n city government. What do we\n do with it now?\"\nLane\n was uncomfortable in\n his dress uniform. First\n there had been a ceremony in\n Tammany Square inaugurating\n Newyork's new Military\n Protectorate, and honoring\n Trooper Lane. Now there was\n a formal dinner. Colonel Klett\n and Gerri Kin sat on either\n side of Lane.\n\n\n Klett said, \"Call me an opportunist\n if you like, Miss\n Kin, my government will be\n stable, and Mars can negotiate\n with it.\" He was a lean, sharp-featured\n man with deep\n grooves in his face, and gray\n hair.\n\n\n Gerri shook her head. \"Recognition\n for a new government\n takes time. I'm going\n back to Mars, and I think\n they'll send another ambassador\n next time. Nothing personal\u2014I\n just don't like it\n here.\"\n\n\n Lane said, \"I'm going to\n Mars, too.\"\n\n\n \"Did she ask you to?\" demanded\n Klett.\n\n\n Lane shook his head. \"She's\n got too much class for me. But\n I like what she told me about\n Mars. It's healthy, like.\"\n\n\n Klett frowned. \"If I thought\n there was a gram of talent involved\n in your capture of the\n Mayor, Lane, I'd never release\n you from duty. But I\n know better. You beat that\n analogue computer by sheer\n stupidity\u2014by disregarding\n your cybrain.\"\n\n\n Lane said, \"It wasn't so stupid\n if it worked.\"\n\n\n \"That's what bothers me. It\n calls for a revision in our tactics.\n We've got a way of beating\n those big computers now,\n should anyone use them\n against us.\"\n\n\n \"I just didn't want her to\n be hurt.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. The computer\n could outguess a machine, like\n your cybrain. But you introduced\n a totally unpredictable\n factor\u2014human emotion.\n Which proves what I, as a\n military man, have always\n maintained\u2014that the deadliest\n weapon in man's arsenal\n is still, and will always be, the\n individual soldier.\"\n\n\n \"What you just said there,\n sir,\" said Lane. \"That's why\n I'm leaving Newyork.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean?\" asked\n Colonel Klett.\n\n\n \"I'm tired of being a weapon,\n sir. I want to be a human\n being.\"\nEND\nWork is the elimination of the traces of work.\n\u2014Michelangelo\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nIf\nJuly 1959.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
