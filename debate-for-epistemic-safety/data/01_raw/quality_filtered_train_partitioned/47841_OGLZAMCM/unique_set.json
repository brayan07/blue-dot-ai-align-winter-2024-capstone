  "article": "The Haunted Fountain\nCHAPTER I\nAn Unsolved Mystery\n\u201cTell Judy about it,\u201d begged Lois. \u201cPlease, Lorraine,\n it can\u2019t be as bad as it appears. There isn\u2019t\n anything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d\nLorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters\n now. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\n loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s\n part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\n wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe\n she\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.\n Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no\n exception.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming\n in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\n for lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have\n problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t\n solve.\u201d\n\u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one\n single spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll\n believe you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\n all those mysteries. I met you when the whole\n valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\n by flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\n not me. He was the hero without even meaning to\n be. He was the one who rode through town and\n warned people that the flood was coming. I was off\n chasing a shadow.\u201d\n\u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n \u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n \u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\n to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\n could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\n her pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\n about?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\n solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\n two before the flood, but what about the haunted\n house you moved into? You were the one who\n tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\n and goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\n ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\n you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n\u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n \u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\n was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\n what she was or how she spoke to me is more than\n I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\n And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\n They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\n this house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\n them when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\n stored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n\u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\n Lois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\n show up the spooks?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\nJudy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\n wasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\n but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\n told them, the summer before they met. Horace\n had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\n that it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\n Lee, who gave him his job with the\nFarringdon\n Daily Herald\n. He had turned in some interesting\n church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\n he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\n where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\n mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\n loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\nHer thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\n confessed now as she reviewed everything that had\n happened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\n that her parents left her every summer while they\n went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\n think she would do?\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\n her. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\n series you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\n plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\n never throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\n saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\n them she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\n you love to read.\u201d\n\u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\nJudy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\n eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\n vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\n little to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\n the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\n was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\n and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\n went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\n scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\n glad to have her.\n\u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\n and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\n behind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\n yourself this time?\u201d\n\u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\n you have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\n can stand the heat.\u201d\nJudy went, not to look over the old magazines so\n much as to escape to a place where she could have a\n good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\n birthday. In another year she would have outgrown\n her childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\n be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\n vacation of her own. In another year she would\n be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\n and solving a mystery to be known as the\nGhost\n Parade\n.\n\u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\n her, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\nBut then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\n idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\n seemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\n came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\n Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\n on a picture of a fountain.\n\u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\n she remembered saying aloud.\nJudy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\n walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\n mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\n fountain still caught and held rainbows like those\n she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\n But all that was in the future. If anyone had told\n the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\n day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\n their faces.\n\u201cThat tease!\u201d\nFor then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\n used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\n she yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\n are you!\u201d\nPeter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\n kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\n The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\n summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\n spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\n she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\n pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\n all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n\u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\n exclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\nA step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\n it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n \u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\n know your wishes instead of muttering them to\n yourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n\u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\nShe and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\n Judy was telling them without interruption.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n \u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\nAnd she went on to tell them how, the very next\n day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\n exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\n of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\n Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the\n water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\n had stared at them a moment and then climbed the\n steps to the pool.\n\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n \u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\nA voice had answered, although she could see no\n one.\n\u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\n shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\n come true.\u201d\n\u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\n tear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n\u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\n surely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n\u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n\u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\n grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\n her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\n there in the attic?\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2014you\nare\nthe fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\n exclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\n doesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n\u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\n said in a mysterious whisper.\nCHAPTER II\nIf Wishes Came True\n\u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n \u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\n longer. What did you wish?\u201d\n\u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\n to that.\u201d\nFirst, she told her friends, she had to think of a\n wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\n those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\n been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\n away.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\n having just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\n in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\n lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\n little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\n they vanished, and so I began naming the things I\n wanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\n wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\n wasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\n and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\n think of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n\u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\nLorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\n Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\n airily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\n of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\n G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\n as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\n spell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\n more.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\n asked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\n things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\n pets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n\u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\n about the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\n wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\n seemed impossible at the time, but the future did\n hold a sister for me.\u201d\n\u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\n Lorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\n sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n\u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\n it was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\n or that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\n know he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\n strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\n enchanted?\u201d\nLois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\n answered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\n at the time. I wandered around, growing very\n drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\n it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\n waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\n had been a dream.\u201d\n\u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\n wasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\n her, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\n beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\n with roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n\u201cAll the year around?\u201d\nAgain Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\n way from June to December.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\n said, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\n time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\n and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\n I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n\u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\n you\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\n you try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n\u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\n I had been older or more experienced. I really should\n have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\n secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\n away it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\n really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\n for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\n impossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\n was your friend.\u201d\n\u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n \u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\n the Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\n things started happening so fast that I completely\n forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\n believe I thought about it again until after we moved\n to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\n saw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n\u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\n Lois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n\u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\n seen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\n picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\n show you.\u201d\nLois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\n Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.\n Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\n tasted it too often while she was making it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\nLois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\n the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\n with cream.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\n he\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\n lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\n He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\n are any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\nLeaving the table, they all started upstairs with\n the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\n grandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\n tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\n removed. But there was still a door closing off the\n narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\n reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n\u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\n I\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\n the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\n noise came from the floor above.\n\u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\n of,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n\u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\n confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\n room at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\n about black cats, but they are creepy. Does\n Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n\u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\n Pausing at still another door that led to the darker\n part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n \u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\n care to explore the past?\u201d\nThe exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\n relating still more of what she remembered about\n the fountain.\n\u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\n said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\n true that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\n she?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\n house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\n you see on that high shelf by the window. I think\n she and Grandpa like the way they lived without\n any modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\n old attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\n the same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\n wished neither of them would outlive the other. If\n they did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\n thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\n Another could have been to keep the good old days,\n as Grandma used to call them. That one came true\n in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\n past when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\n I meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n\u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\n myself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\n were the way they used to be when I trusted\n Arthur\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\nAfterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\n and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\n she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\n through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\n was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\n monster coming between her and her handsome husband,\n Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\n seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\n in Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\n the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\n is. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\n Judy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\n sure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\n to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\n But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\n If she did, she pretended not to.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\n to, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n\u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n \u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\n more closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\n like the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n\u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n \u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\n all the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\n Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you\n come into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\n back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\n to her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\n into the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n \u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\n isn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\n took?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\n Lois suggested.\nCHAPTER III\nA Strange Encounter\nLorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\n trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\n it under one condition. They were not to drive all\n the way to the house which, she said, was just over\n the hilltop. They were to park the car where no\n one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n\u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nJudy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.\n She and Lois both argued that it would be better to\n inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n\u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it\n looks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they\n started off in the blue car she was driving.\nIt was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\n easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\n and said if they did find the fountain she thought\n she\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.\n\u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said\n about wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you\n let people know about them instead of muttering\n them to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n\u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know\n about this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\n be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\n coat he gave me last year.\u201d\n\u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too\n warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\n trip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\n as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\nThe trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\n had covered the distance that had seemed such a\n long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s\n wagon.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve\n just about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t\n think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\n to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\n queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s\n old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t\n explain what happened afterwards. When I woke\n up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\n wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to\n see how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d\nAgain she broke off as if there were something\n she wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.\n\u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.\n\u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\n were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\n but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d\n Lorraine reminded her.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,\n but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember\n driving home along this road. You see, I thought my\n grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\n and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\n There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d\n\u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next\n hill,\u201d Lois put in.\n\u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I\n couldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\n tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\n I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in\n the woods that always tempts me.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\n your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where\n the hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d\n Judy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes\n peered out at me from unexpected places. I was\n actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\n There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard\n the rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he\n was driving off without me.\u201d\n\u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,\n and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like\n that?\u201d\n\u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\n and wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\n \u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\n them, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for\n Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they\n turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s\n another car coming.\u201d\nAs Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\n ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\n Judy until the car had passed. The man driving\n it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\n his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\n long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\n most of his hair.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois\n when the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for\n playing hide and seek?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine\n begged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there\n any more.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\n can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.\nShe was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\n more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\nLois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\n road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\n of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\n green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\n The sky was gray with white clouds being driven\n across it by the wind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can\n see it over to the left. It looks like something out of\n Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder\n what it is.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It\n would be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut\n if there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give\n us permission.\u201d\n\u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy\n suggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends\n as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\n road. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to\n explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for\n the fountain.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt\n won\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf\n you know anything about the people who live here\n now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\n I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do\n know who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember\n Roger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?\n I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have\n acquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on\n the estate.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you\n tell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places\n together.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\n \u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d\n\u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a\n car of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger\n Banning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better\n than that. I did know him slightly, but not from\n school. The boys and girls were separated and went\n to different high schools by the time we moved to\n Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\n lot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at\n church.\u201d\n\u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer\n mention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.\nLike Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\n to gossip.\n\u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\n his father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\n business people. I think he forged some legal\n documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\n It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.\nNow Judy did remember. It was something she\n would have preferred to forget. She liked to think\n she was a good judge of character, and she had taken\n Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\n never stoop to crime.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d\n Lois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look\n for it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I\n just like to know what a tiger looks like before he\n springs at me,\u201d Judy explained.\n\u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition\n of ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who\n seems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.\n Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve\n seen that character who drove down this road and,\n for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\n Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d\nLorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\n evasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private\n estates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\n \u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect\n we\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\n of trespassing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two\n dark-coated figures strode down the road toward\n them. \u201cYou drove right by a\n NO TRESPASSING\n sign,\n and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to\n meet us!\u201d\n",
