  "article": "THE DOPE\n\n on Mars\nBy JACK SHARKEY\nSomebody had to get the human\n angle on this trip ... but what\n was humane about sending me?\nIllustrated by WOOD\nMy\n agent was the one who\n got me the job of going\n along to write up the first\n trip to Mars. He was always getting\n me things like that\u2014appearances\n on TV shows, or mentions in writers'\n magazines. If he didn't sell\n much of my stuff, at least he sold\nme\n.\n\n\n \"It'll be the biggest break a\n writer ever got,\" he told me, two\n days before blastoff. \"Oh, sure\n there'll be scientific reports on the\n trip, but the public doesn't want\n them; they want the\nhuman\nslant\n on things.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said weakly, \"I'll\n probably be locked up for the\n whole trip. If there are fights or accidents,\n they won't tell\nme\nabout\n them.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense,\" said Louie, sipping\n carefully at a paper cup of scalding\n coffee. \"It'll be just like the\n public going along vicariously.\n They'll\nidentify\nwith you.\"\n\n\n \"But, Louie,\" I said, wiping the\n dampness from my palms on the\n knees of my trousers as I sat there,\n \"how'll I go about it? A story? An\n article? A\nyou-are-there\ntype of report?\n What?\"\n\n\n Louie shrugged. \"So keep a\n diary. It'll be more intimate, like.\"\n\n\n \"But what if nothing happens?\"\n I insisted hopelessly.\n\n\n Louie smiled. \"So you fake it.\"\n\n\n I got up from the chair in his office\n and stepped to the door.\n \"That's dishonest,\" I pointed out.\n\n\n \"Creative is the word,\" Louie\n said.\n\n\n So I went on the first trip to\n Mars. And I kept a diary. This is\n it. And it is honest. Honest it is.\nOctober 1, 1960\nThey picked\n the launching\n date from the March, 1959, New\n York\nTimes\n, which stated that this\n was the most likely time for launching.\n Trip time is supposed to take\n 260 days (that's one way), so\n we're aimed toward where Mars\n will be (had\nbetter\nbe, or else).\n\n\n There are five of us on board. A\n pilot, co-pilot, navigator and biochemist.\n And, of course, me. I've\n met all but the pilot (he's very\n busy today), and they seem friendly\n enough.\n\n\n Dwight Kroger, the biochemist,\n is rather old to take the \"rigors of\n the journey,\" as he puts it, but the\n government had a choice between\n sending a green scientist who could\n stand the trip or an accomplished\n man who would probably not survive,\n so they picked Kroger. We've\n blasted off, though, and he's still\n with us. He looks a damn sight better\n than I feel. He's kind of balding,\n and very iron-gray-haired and\n skinny, but his skin is tan as an Indian's,\n and right now he's telling\n jokes in the washroom with the co-pilot.\n\n\n Jones (that's the co-pilot; I\n didn't quite catch his first name) is\n scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and\n gives the general appearance of belonging\n under the spreading chestnut\n tree, not in a metal bullet flinging\n itself out into airless space.\n Come to think of it, who\ndoes\nbelong\n where we are?\n\n\n The navigator's name is Lloyd\n Streeter, but I haven't seen his face\n yet. He has a little cubicle behind\n the pilot's compartment, with all\n kinds of maps and rulers and things.\n He keeps bent low over a welded-to-the-wall\n (they call it the bulkhead,\n for some reason or other)\n table, scratching away with a ballpoint\n pen on the maps, and now\n and then calling numbers over a\n microphone to the pilot. His hair\n is red and curly, and he looks as\n though he'd be tall if he ever gets\n to stand up. There are freckles on\n the backs of his hands, so I think\n he's probably got them on his face,\n too. So far, all he's said is, \"Scram,\n I'm busy.\"\n\n\n Kroger tells me that the pilot's\n name is Patrick Desmond, but that\n I can call him Pat when I get to\n know him better. So far, he's still\n Captain Desmond to me. I haven't\n the vaguest idea what he looks like.\n He was already on board when I\n got here, with my typewriter and\n ream of paper, so we didn't meet.\n\n\n My compartment is small but\n clean. I mean clean now. It wasn't\n during blastoff. The inertial gravities\n didn't bother me so much as\n the gyroscopic spin they put on the\n ship so we have a sort of artificial\n gravity to hold us against the\n curved floor. It's that constant\n whirly feeling that gets me. I get\n sick on merry-go-rounds, too.\n\n\n They're having pork for dinner\n today. Not me.\nOctober 2, 1960\nFeeling much\n better today.\n Kroger gave me a box of Dramamine\n pills. He says they'll help my\n stomach. So far, so good.\n\n\n Lloyd came by, also. \"You play\n chess?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"A little,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"How about a game sometime?\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Do you have a\n board?\"\n\n\n He didn't.\n\n\n Lloyd went away then, but the\n interview wasn't wasted. I learned\n that he\nis\ntall and\ndoes\nhave a\n freckled face. Maybe we can build\n a chessboard. With my paper and\n his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should\n be easy. Don't know what we'll use\n for pieces, though.\n\n\n Jones (I still haven't learned his\n first name) has been up with the\n pilot all day. He passed my room\n on the way to the galley (the\n kitchen) for a cup of dark brown\n coffee (they like it thick) and told\n me that we were almost past the\n Moon. I asked to look, but he said\n not yet; the instrument panel is\n Top Secret. They'd have to cover\n it so I could look out the viewing\n screen, and they still need it for\n steering or something.\n\n\n I still haven't met the pilot.\nOctober 3, 1960\nWell, I've\n met the pilot. He is\n kind of squat, with a vulturish neck\n and close-set jet-black eyes that\n make him look rather mean, but he\n was pleasant enough, and said I\n could call him Pat. I still don't\n know Jones' first name, though Pat\n spoke to him, and it sounded like\n Flants. That can't be right.\n\n\n Also, I am one of the first five\n men in the history of the world to\n see the opposite side of the Moon,\n with a bluish blurred crescent beyond\n it that Pat said was the Earth.\n The back of the Moon isn't much\n different from the front. As to the\n space in front of the ship, well, it's\n all black with white dots in it, and\n none of the dots move, except in a\n circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"\n result from the gyroscopic spin\n we're in. Actually, he explained to\n me, the screen is supposed to keep\n the image of space locked into\n place no matter how much we spin.\n But there's some kind of a \"drag.\"\n I told him I hoped it didn't mean\n we'd land on Mars upside down. He\n just stared at me.\n\n\n I can't say I was too impressed\n with that 16 x 19 view of outer\n space. It's been done much better\n in the movies. There's just no awesomeness\n to it, no sense of depth or\n immensity. It's as impressive as a\n piece of velvet with salt sprinkled\n on it.\n\n\n Lloyd and I made a chessboard\n out of a carton. Right now we're using\n buttons for men. He's one of\n these fast players who don't stop\n and think out their moves. And so\n far I haven't won a game.\n\n\n It looks like a long trip.\nOctober 4, 1960\nI won\n a game. Lloyd mistook my\n queen-button for my bishop-button\n and left his king in jeopardy, and\n I checkmated him next move. He\n said chess was a waste of time\n and he had important work to do\n and he went away.\n\n\n I went to the galley for coffee\n and had a talk about moss with\n Kroger. He said there was a good\n chance of lichen on Mars, and I\n misunderstood and said, \"A good\n chance of liking\nwhat\non Mars?\"\n and Kroger finished his coffee and\n went up front.\n\n\n When I got back to my compartment,\n Lloyd had taken away the\n chessboard and all his buttons. He\n told me later he needed it to back\n up a star map.\n\n\n Pat slept mostly all day in his\n compartment, and Jones sat and\n watched the screen revolve. There\n wasn't much to do, so I wrote a\n poem, sort of.\n\nMary, Mary, quite contrary,\n \nHow does your garden grow?\n \nWith Martian rime, Venusian slime,\n \nAnd a radioactive hoe.\n \n\n I showed it to Kroger. He says\n it may prove to be environmentally\n accurate, but that I should stick to\n prose.\nOctober 5, 1960\nLearned Jones'\n first name.\n He wrote something in the ship's\n log, and I saw his signature. His\n name is Fleance, like in \"Macbeth.\"\n He prefers to be called Jones. Pat\n uses his first name as a gag. Some\n fun.\n\n\n And only 255 days to go.\nApril 1, 1961\nI've skipped\n over the last 177\n days or so, because there's nothing\n much new. I brought some books\n with me on the trip, books that I'd\n always meant to read and never\n had the time. So now I know all\n about\nVanity Fair\n,\nPride and Prejudice\n,\nWar and Peace\n,\nGone with\n the Wind\n, and\nBabbitt\n.\n\n\n They didn't take as long as I\n thought they would, except for\nVanity Fair\n. It must have been a\n riot when it first came out. I mean,\n all those sly digs at the aristocracy,\n with copious interpolations by Mr.\n Thackeray in case you didn't get\n it when he'd pulled a particularly\n good gag. Some fun.\n\n\n And only 78 days to go.\nJune 1, 1961\nOnly 17 days\n to go. I saw Mars\n on the screen today. It seems to be\n descending from overhead, but Pat\n says that that's the \"torque\" doing\n it. Actually, it's we who are coming\n in sideways.\n\n\n We've all grown beards, too. Pat\n said it was against regulations, but\n what the hell. We have a contest.\n Longest whiskers on landing gets a\n prize.\n\n\n I asked Pat what the prize was\n and he told me to go to hell.\nJune 18, 1961\nMars has\n the whole screen\n filled. Looks like Death Valley. No\n sign of canals, but Pat says that's\n because of the dust storm down below.\n It's nice to have a \"down below\"\n again. We're going to land, so\n I have to go to my bunk. It's all\n foam rubber, nylon braid supports\n and magnesium tubing. Might as\n well be cement for all the good it\n did me at takeoff. Earth seems awfully\n far away.\nJune 19, 1961\nWell, we're down.\n We have\n to wear gas masks with oxygen\n hook-ups. Kroger says the air is\n breathable, but thin, and it has too\n much dust in it to be any fun to\n inhale. He's all for going out and\n looking for lichen, but Pat says he's\n got to set up camp, then get instructions\n from Earth. So we just have\n to wait. The air is very cold, but the\n Sun is hot as hell when it hits you.\n The sky is a blinding pink, or maybe\n more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger\n says it's the dust. The sand underfoot\n is kind of rose-colored, and not\n really gritty. The particles are\n round and smooth.\n\n\n No lichen so far. Kroger says\n maybe in the canals, if there are\n any canals. Lloyd wants to play\n chess again.\n\n\n Jones won the beard contest. Pat\n gave him a cigar he'd smuggled on\n board (no smoking was allowed on\n the ship), and Jones threw it away.\n He doesn't smoke.\nJune 20, 1961\nGot lost today.\n Pat told me\n not to go too far from camp, so,\n when I took a stroll, I made sure\n every so often that I could still see\n the rocket behind me. Walked for\n maybe an hour; then the oxygen\n gauge got past the halfway mark,\n so I started back toward the rocket.\n After maybe ten steps, the rocket\n disappeared. One minute it was\n standing there, tall and silvery, the\n next instant it was gone.\n\n\n Turned on my radio pack and\n got hold of Pat. Told him what happened,\n and he told Kroger. Kroger\n said I had been following a mirage,\n to step back a bit. I did, and I could\n see the ship again. Kroger said to\n try and walk toward where the ship\n seemed to be, even when it wasn't\n in view, and meantime they'd come\n out after me in the jeep, following\n my footprints.\n\n\n Started walking back, and the\n ship vanished again. It reappeared,\n disappeared, but I kept going. Finally\n saw the real ship, and Lloyd\n and Jones waving their arms at me.\n They were shouting through their\n masks, but I couldn't hear them.\n The air is too thin to carry sound\n well.\n\n\n All at once, something gleamed\n in their hands, and they started\n shooting at me with their rifles.\n That's when I heard the noise behind\n me. I was too scared to turn\n around, but finally Jones and Lloyd\n came running over, and I got up\n enough nerve to look. There was\n nothing there, but on the sand,\n paralleling mine, were footprints.\n At least I think they were footprints.\n Twice as long as mine, and\n three times as wide, but kind of\n featureless because the sand's loose\n and dry. They doubled back on\n themselves, spaced considerably\n farther apart.\n\n\n \"What was it?\" I asked Lloyd\n when he got to me.\n\n\n \"Damned if I know,\" he said. \"It\n was red and scaly, and I think it\n had a tail. It was two heads taller\n than you.\" He shuddered. \"Ran off\n when we fired.\"\n\n\n \"Where,\" said Jones, \"are Pat and\n Kroger?\"\n\n\n I didn't know. I hadn't seen\n them, nor the jeep, on my trip back.\n So we followed the wheel tracks for\n a while, and they veered off from\n my trail and followed another, very\n much like the one that had been\n paralleling mine when Jones and\n Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly\n thing.\n\n\n \"We'd better get them on the\n radio,\" said Jones, turning back\n toward the ship.\n\n\n There wasn't anything on the\n radio but static.\n\n\n Pat and Kroger haven't come\n back yet, either.\nJune 21, 1961\nWe're not\n alone here. More of\n the scaly things have come toward\n the camp, but a few rifle shots send\n them away. They hop like kangaroos\n when they're startled. Their\n attitudes aren't menacing, but their\n appearance is. And Jones says,\n \"Who knows what's 'menacing' in\n an alien?\"\n\n\n We're going to look for Kroger\n and Pat today. Jones says we'd better\n before another windstorm blows\n away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,\n the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we\n always have the smears to follow,\n unless they get covered up, too.\n We're taking extra oxygen, shells,\n and rifles. Food, too, of course.\n And we're locking up the ship.\nIt's later\n , now. We found the\n jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of\n those big tracks nearby. We're taking\n the jeep to follow the aliens'\n tracks. There's some moss around\n here, on reddish brown rocks that\n stick up through the sand, just on\n the shady side, though. Kroger\n must be happy to have found his\n lichen.\n\n\n The trail ended at the brink of\n a deep crevice in the ground. Seems\n to be an earthquake-type split in\n solid rock, with the sand sifting\n over this and the far edge like pink\n silk cataracts. The bottom is in the\n shade and can't be seen. The crack\n seems to extend to our left and\n right as far as we can look.\n\n\n There looks like a trail down the\n inside of the crevice, but the Sun's\n setting, so we're waiting till tomorrow\n to go down.\n\n\n Going down was Jones' idea,\n not mine.\nJune 22, 1961\nWell, we're\n at the bottom, and\n there's water here, a shallow stream\n about thirty feet wide that runs\n along the center of the canal (we've\n decided we're in a canal). No sign\n of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand\n here is hard-packed and damp, and\n there are normal-size footprints\n mingled with the alien ones, sharp\n and clear. The aliens seem to have\n six or seven toes. It varies from\n print to print. And they're barefoot,\n too, or else they have the damnedest-looking\n shoes in creation.\n\n\n The constant shower of sand\n near the cliff walls is annoying, but\n it's sandless (shower-wise) near\n the stream, so we're following the\n footprints along the bank. Also, the\n air's better down here. Still thin,\n but not so bad as on the surface.\n We're going without masks to save\n oxygen for the return trip (Jones\n assures me there'll\nbe\na return\n trip), and the air's only a little bit\n sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose\n and mouth solve this.\n\n\n We look like desperadoes, what\n with the rifles and covered faces. I\n said as much to Lloyd and he told\n me to shut up. Moss all over the\n cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger.\nWe've found\n Kroger and Pat,\n with the help of the aliens. Or maybe\n I should call them the Martians.\n Either way, it's better than what\n Jones calls them.\n\n\n They took away our rifles and\n brought us right to Kroger and Pat,\n without our even asking. Jones is\n mad at the way they got the rifles so\n easily. When we came upon them\n (a group of maybe ten, huddling\n behind a boulder in ambush), he\n fired, but the shots either bounced\n off their scales or stuck in their\n thick hides. Anyway, they took the\n rifles away and threw them into the\n stream, and picked us all up and\n took us into a hole in the cliff wall.\n The hole went on practically forever,\n but it didn't get dark. Kroger\n tells me that there are phosphorescent\n bacteria living in the mold on\n the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave\n smell, but it's richer in oxygen\n than even at the stream.\n\n\n We're in a small cave that is just\n off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels\n come together. I can't remember\n which one we came in through,\n and neither can anyone else. Jones\n asked me what the hell I kept writing\n in the diary for, did I want to\n make it a gift to Martian archeologists?\n But I said where there's life\n there's hope, and now he won't talk\n to me. I congratulated Kroger on\n the lichen I'd seen, but he just said\n a short and unscientific word and\n went to sleep.\n\n\n There's a Martian guarding the\n entrance to our cave. I don't know\n what they intend to do with us.\n Feed us, I hope. So far, they've just\n left us here, and we're out of rations.\n\n\n Kroger tried talking to the guard\n once, but he (or it) made a whistling\n kind of sound and flashed a\n mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the\n teeth are in multiple rows, like a\n tiger shark's. I'd rather he hadn't\n told me.\nJune 23, 1961, I think\nWe're either\n in a docket or a\n zoo. I can't tell which. There's a\n rather square platform surrounded\n on all four sides by running water,\n maybe twenty feet across, and\n we're on it. Martians keep coming\n to the far edge of the water and\n looking at us and whistling at each\n other. A little Martian came near\n the edge of the water and a larger\n Martian whistled like crazy and\n dragged it away.\n\n\n \"Water must be dangerous to\n them,\" said Kroger.\n\n\n \"We shoulda brought water pistols,\"\n Jones muttered.\n\n\n Pat said maybe we can swim to\n safety. Kroger told Pat he was\n crazy, that the little island we're on\n here underground is bordered by a\n fast river that goes into the planet.\n We'd end up drowned in some grotto\n in the heart of the planet, says\n Kroger.\n\n\n \"What the hell,\" says Pat, \"it's\n better than starving.\"\n\n\n It is not.\nJune 24, 1961, probably\nI'm hungry\n . So is everybody\n else. Right now I could eat a dinner\n raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it\n down. A Martian threw a stone at\n Jones today, and Jones threw one\n back at him and broke off a couple\n of scales. The Martian whistled\n furiously and went away. When the\n crowd thinned out, same as it did\n yesterday (must be some sort of\n sleeping cycle here), Kroger talked\n Lloyd into swimming across the\n river and getting the red scales.\n Lloyd started at the upstream part\n of the current, and was about a hundred\n yards below this underground\n island before he made the far side.\n Sure is a swift current.\n\n\n But he got the scales, walked\n very far upstream of us, and swam\n back with them. The stream sides\n are steep, like in a fjord, and we\n had to lift him out of the swirling\n cold water, with the scales gripped\n in his fist. Or what was left of the\n scales. They had melted down in\n the water and left his hand all\n sticky.\n\n\n Kroger took the gummy things,\n studied them in the uncertain light,\n then tasted them and grinned.\n\n\n The Martians are made of sugar.\nLater, same day\n . Kroger\n said that the Martian metabolism\n must be like Terran (Earth-type)\n metabolism, only with no pancreas\n to make insulin. They store their\n energy on the\noutside\nof their\n bodies, in the form of scales. He's\n watched them more closely and\n seen that they have long rubbery\n tubes for tongues, and that they\n now and then suck up water from\n the stream while they're watching\n us, being careful not to get their lips\n (all sugar, of course) wet. He\n guesses that their \"blood\" must be\n almost pure water, and that it\n washes away (from the inside, of\n course) the sugar they need for\n energy.\n\n\n I asked him where the sugar\n came from, and he said probably\n their bodies isolated carbon from\n something (he thought it might be\n the moss) and combined it with\n the hydrogen and oxygen in the\n water (even\nI\nknew the formula for\n water) to make sugar, a common\n carbohydrate.\n\n\n Like plants, on Earth, he said.\n Except, instead of using special\n cells on leaves to form carbohydrates\n with the help of sunpower,\n as Earth plants do in photosynthesis\n (Kroger spelled that word\n for me), they used the\nshape\nof the\n scales like prisms, to isolate the\n spectra (another Kroger word)\n necessary to form the sugar.\n\n\n \"I don't get it,\" I said politely,\n when he'd finished his spiel.\n\n\n \"Simple,\" he said, as though he\n were addressing me by name.\n \"They have a twofold reason to fear\n water. One: by complete solvency\n in that medium, they lose all energy\n and die. Two: even partial sprinkling\n alters the shape of the scales,\n and they are unable to use sunpower\n to form more sugar, and still die,\n if a bit slower.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, taking it down verbatim.\n \"So now what do we do?\"\n\n\n \"We remove our boots,\" said\n Kroger, sitting on the ground and\n doing so, \"and then we cross this\n stream, fill the boots with water,\n and\nspray\nour way to freedom.\"\n\n\n \"Which tunnel do we take?\"\n asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the\n thought of escape.\n\n\n Kroger shrugged. \"We'll have to\n chance taking any that seem to\n slope upward. In any event, we can\n always follow it back and start\n again.\"\n\n\n \"I dunno,\" said Jones. \"Remember\n those\nteeth\nof theirs. They must\n be for biting something more substantial\n than moss, Kroger.\"\n\n\n \"We'll risk it,\" said Pat. \"It's better\n to go down fighting than to die\n of starvation.\"\n\n\n The hell it is.\nJune 24, 1961, for sure\nThe Martians\n have coal\n mines.\nThat's\nwhat they use those\n teeth for. We passed through one\n and surprised a lot of them chewing\n gritty hunks of anthracite out\n of the walls. They came running at\n us, whistling with those tubelike\n tongues, and drooling dry coal dust,\n but Pat swung one of his boots in\n an arc that splashed all over the\n ground in front of them, and they\n turned tail (literally) and clattered\n off down another tunnel,\n sounding like a locomotive whistle\n gone berserk.\n\n\n We made the surface in another\n hour, back in the canal, and were\n lucky enough to find our own trail\n to follow toward the place above\n which the jeep still waited.\n\n\n Jones got the rifles out of the\n stream (the Martians had probably\n thought they were beyond recovery\n there) and we found the jeep. It\n was nearly buried in sand, but we\n got it cleaned off and running, and\n got back to the ship quickly. First\n thing we did on arriving was to\n break out the stores and have a\n celebration feast just outside the\n door of the ship.\n\n\n It was pork again, and I got sick.\nJune 25, 1961\nWe're going back\n . Pat says\n that a week is all we were allowed\n to stay and that it's urgent to return\n and tell what we've learned\n about Mars (we know there are\n Martians, and they're made of\n sugar).\n\n\n \"Why,\" I said, \"can't we just tell\n it on the radio?\"\n\n\n \"Because,\" said Pat, \"if we tell\n them now, by the time we get back\n we'll be yesterday's news. This way\n we may be lucky and get a parade.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe even money,\" said\n Kroger, whose mind wasn't always\n on science.\n\n\n \"But they'll ask why we didn't\n radio the info, sir,\" said Jones uneasily.\n\n\n \"The radio,\" said Pat, nodding to\n Lloyd, \"was unfortunately broken\n shortly after landing.\"\n\n\n Lloyd blinked, then nodded\n back and walked around the\n rocket. I heard a crunching sound\n and the shattering of glass, not unlike\n the noise made when one\n drives a rifle butt through a radio.\n\n\n Well, it's time for takeoff.\nThis time\n it wasn't so bad. I\n thought I was getting my space-legs,\n but Pat says there's less gravity on\n Mars, so escape velocity didn't\n have to be so fast, hence a smoother\n (relatively) trip on our shock-absorbing\n bunks.\n\n\n Lloyd wants to play chess again.\n I'll be careful not to win this time.\n However, if I don't win, maybe this\n time\nI'll\nbe the one to quit.\n\n\n Kroger is busy in his cramped\n lab space trying to classify the little\n moss he was able to gather, and\n Jones and Pat are up front watching\n the white specks revolve on that\n black velvet again.\n\n\n Guess I'll take a nap.\nJune 26, 1961\nHell's bells\n . Kroger says\n there are two baby Martians loose\n on board ship. Pat told him he\n was nuts, but there are certain\n signs he's right. Like the missing\n charcoal in the air-filtration-and-reclaiming\n (AFAR) system. And\n the water gauges are going down.\n But the clincher is those two sugar\n crystals Lloyd had grabbed up\n when we were in that zoo. They're\n gone.\n\n\n Pat has declared a state of emergency.\n Quick thinking, that's Pat.\n Lloyd, before he remembered and\n turned scarlet, suggested we radio\n Earth for instructions. We can't.\n\n\n Here we are, somewhere in a\n void headed for Earth, with enough\n air and water left for maybe three\n days\u2014if the Martians don't take\n any more.\n\n\n Kroger is thrilled that he is\n learning something, maybe, about\n Martian reproductive processes.\n When he told Pat, Pat put it to a\n vote whether or not to jettison\n Kroger through the airlock. However,\n it was decided that responsibility\n was pretty well divided.\n Lloyd had gotten the crystals,\n Kroger had only studied them, and\n Jones had brought them aboard.\n\n\n So Kroger stays, but meanwhile\n the air is getting worse. Pat suggested\n Kroger put us all into a state\n of suspended animation till landing\n time, eight months away. Kroger\n said, \"How?\"\nJune 27, 1961\nAir is foul\n and I'm very\n thirsty. Kroger says that at least\u2014when\n the Martians get bigger\u2014they'll\n have to show themselves.\n Pat says what do we do\nthen\n? We\n can't afford the water we need to\n melt them down. Besides, the\n melted crystals might\nall\nturn into\n little Martians.\n\n\n Jones says he'll go down spitting.\n\n\n Pat says why not dismantle interior\n of rocket to find out where\n they're holing up? Fine idea.\n\n\n How do you dismantle riveted\n metal plates?\nJune 28, 1961\nThe AFAR system\n is no more\n and the water gauges are still dropping.\n Kroger suggests baking bread,\n then slicing it, then toasting it till\n it turns to carbon, and we can use\n the carbon in the AFAR system.\n\n\n We'll have to try it, I guess.\nThe Martians\n ate the bread.\n Jones came forward to tell us the\n loaves were cooling, and when he\n got back they were gone. However,\n he did find a few of the red crystals\n on the galley deck (floor). They're\n good-sized crystals, too. Which\n means so are the Martians.\n\n\n Kroger says the Martians must\n be intelligent, otherwise they\n couldn't have guessed at the carbohydrates\n present in the bread after\n a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat\n says let's jettison Kroger.\n\n\n This time the vote went against\n Kroger, but he got a last-minute reprieve\n by suggesting the crystals\n be pulverized and mixed with sulphuric\n acid. He says this'll produce\n carbon.\n\n\n I certainly hope so.\n\n\n So does Kroger.\nBrief reprieve\n for us. The\n acid-sugar combination not only\n produces carbon but water vapor,\n and the gauge has gone up a notch.\n That means that we have a quart\n of water in the tanks for drinking.\n However, the air's a bit better,\n and we voted to let Kroger stay inside\n the rocket.\n\n\n Meantime, we have to catch\n those Martians.\nJune 29, 1961\nWorse and worse\n . Lloyd\n caught one of the Martians in the\n firing chamber. We had to flood\n the chamber with acid to subdue\n the creature, which carbonized\n nicely. So now we have plenty of\n air and water again, but besides\n having another Martian still on\n the loose, we now don't have\n enough acid left in the fuel tanks\n to make a landing.\n\n\n Pat says at least our vector will\n carry us to Earth and we can die\n on our home planet, which is better\n than perishing in space.\n\n\n The hell it is.\nMarch 3, 1962\nEarth in sight\n . The other\n Martian is still with us. He's where\n we can't get at him without blow-torches,\n but he can't get at the carbon\n in the AFAR system, either,\n which is a help. However, his tail\n is prehensile, and now and then it\n snakes out through an air duct and\n yanks food right off the table from\n under our noses.\n\n\n Kroger says watch out.\nWe\nare\n made of carbohydrates, too. I'd\n rather not have known.\nMarch 4, 1962\nEarth fills\n the screen in the\n control room. Pat says if we're\n lucky, he might be able to use the\n bit of fuel we have left to set us\n in a descending spiral into one of\n the oceans. The rocket is tighter\n than a submarine, he insists, and\n it will float till we're rescued, if\n the plates don't crack under the impact.\n\n\n We all agreed to try it. Not that\n we thought it had a good chance of\n working, but none of us had a better\n idea.\nI guess\n you know the rest of\n the story, about how that destroyer\n spotted us and got us and\n my diary aboard, and towed the\n rocket to San Francisco. News of\n the \"captured Martian\" leaked out,\n and we all became nine-day wonders\n until the dismantling of the\n rocket.\n\n\n Kroger says he must have dissolved\n in the water, and wonders\n what\nthat\nwould do. There are\n about a thousand of those crystal-scales\n on a Martian.\n\n\n So last week we found out, when\n those red-scaled things began clambering\n out of the sea on every coastal\n region on Earth. Kroger tried\n to explain to me about salinity osmosis\n and hydrostatic pressure and\n crystalline life, but in no time at all\n he lost me.\n\n\n The point is, bullets won't stop\n these things, and wherever a crystal\n falls, a new Martian springs up\n in a few weeks. It looks like the\n five of us have abetted an invasion\n from Mars.\n\n\n Needless to say, we're no longer\n heroes.\n\n\n I haven't heard from Pat or\n Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked\n up attacking a candy factory yesterday,\n and Kroger and I were allowed\n to sign on for the flight to\n Venus scheduled within the next\n few days\u2014because of our experience.\n\n\n Kroger says there's only enough\n fuel for a one-way trip. I don't care.\n I've always wanted to travel with\n the President.\n\u2014JACK SHARKEY\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nGalaxy Magazine\nJune 1960.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
