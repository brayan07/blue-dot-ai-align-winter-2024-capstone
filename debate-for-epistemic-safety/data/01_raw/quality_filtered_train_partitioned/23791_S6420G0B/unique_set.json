Some people\n said that no normal man could do\n it, and mentioned the scar of a\n ghastly head-wound to explain his\n ability. One man partly guessed the\n secret, but only partly. His name was\n Sattell and he had reason not to\n talk. Pop Young alone knew the\n whole truth, and he kept his mouth\n shut, too. It wasn't anybody else's\n business.\n\n\n The shack and the job he filled\n were located in the medieval notion\n of the physical appearance of hell.\n By day the environment was heat and\n torment. By night\u2014lunar night, of\n course, and lunar day\u2014it was frigidity\n and horror. Once in two weeks\n Earth-time a rocketship came around\n the horizon from Lunar City with\n stores for the colony deep underground.\n Pop received the stores and\n took care of them. He handed over\n the product of the mine, to be forwarded\n to Earth. The rocket went\n away again. Come nightfall Pop\n lowered the supplies down the long\n cable into the Big Crack to the colony\n far down inside, and freshened up\n the landing field marks with magnesium\n marking-powder if a rocket-blast\n had blurred them. That was\n fundamentally all he had to do. But\n without him the mine down in the\n Crack would have had to shut\n down.\n\n\n The Crack, of course, was that\n gaping rocky fault which stretches\n nine hundred miles, jaggedly, over\n the side of the Moon that Earth\n never sees. There is one stretch where\n it is a yawning gulf a full half-mile\n wide and unguessably deep. Where\n Pop Young's shack stood it was only\n a hundred yards, but the colony was\n a full mile down, in one wall. There\n is nothing like it on Earth, of course.\n When it was first found, scientists\n descended into it to examine the exposed\n rock-strata and learn the history\n of the Moon before its craters\n were made. But they found more\n than history. They found the reason\n for the colony and the rocket landing\n field and the shack.\n\n\n The reason for Pop was something\n else.\n\n\n The shack stood a hundred feet\n from the Big Crack's edge. It looked\n like a dust-heap thirty feet high, and\n it was. The outside was surface\n moondust, piled over a tiny dome to\n be insulation against the cold of\n night and shadow and the furnace\n heat of day. Pop lived in it all alone,\n and in his spare time he worked\n industriously at recovering some\n missing portions of his life that Sattell\n had managed to take away from\n him.\n\n\n He thought often of Sattell, down\n in the colony underground. There\n were galleries and tunnels and living-quarters\n down there. There were\n air-tight bulkheads for safety, and a\n hydroponic garden to keep the air\n fresh, and all sorts of things to make\n life possible for men under if not\n on the Moon.\n\n\n But it wasn't fun, even underground.\n In the Moon's slight gravity,\n a man is really adjusted to existence\n when he has a well-developed case\n of agoraphobia. With such an aid, a\n man can get into a tiny, coffinlike\n cubbyhole, and feel solidity above\n and below and around him, and\n happily tell himself that it feels delicious.\n Sometimes it does.\n\n\n But Sattell couldn't comfort himself\n so easily. He knew about Pop,\n up on the surface. He'd shipped out,\n whimpering, to the Moon to get far\n away from Pop, and Pop was just\n about a mile overhead and there was\n no way to get around him. It was\n difficult to get away from the mine,\n anyhow. It doesn't take too long for\n the low gravity to tear a man's\n nerves to shreds. He has to develop\n kinks in his head to survive. And\n those kinks\u2014\n\n\n The first men to leave the colony\n had to be knocked cold and shipped\n out unconscious. They'd been underground\u2014and\n in low gravity\u2014long\n enough to be utterly unable to face\n the idea of open spaces. Even now\n there were some who had to be carried,\n but there were some tougher\n ones who were able to walk to the\n rocketship if Pop put a tarpaulin\n over their heads so they didn't have\n to see the sky. In any case Pop was\n essential, either for carrying or\n guidance.\nSattell got the shakes when he\n thought of Pop, and Pop rather\n probably knew it. Of course, by the\n time he took the job tending the\n shack, he was pretty certain about\n Sattell. The facts spoke for themselves.\n\n\n Pop had come back to consciousness\n in a hospital with a great\n wound in his head and no memory\n of anything that had happened before\n that moment. It was not that his\n identity was in question. When he\n was stronger, the doctors told him\n who he was, and as gently as possible\n what had happened to his wife\n and children. They'd been murdered\n after he was seemingly killed defending\n them. But he didn't remember\n a thing. Not then. It was\n something of a blessing.\n\n\n But when he was physically recovered\n he set about trying to pick\n up the threads of the life he could\n no longer remember. He met Sattell\n quite by accident. Sattell looked familiar.\n Pop eagerly tried to ask him\n questions. And Sattell turned gray\n and frantically denied that he'd ever\n seen Pop before.\n\n\n All of which happened back on\n Earth and a long time ago. It seemed\n to Pop that the sight of Sattell had\n brought back some vague and cloudy\n memories. They were not sharp,\n though, and he hunted up Sattell\n again to find out if he was right.\n And Sattell went into panic when\n he returned.\n\n\n Nowadays, by the Big Crack, Pop\n wasn't so insistent on seeing Sattell,\n but he was deeply concerned with\n the recovery of the memories that\n Sattell helped bring back. Pop was\n a highly conscientious man. He took\n good care of his job. There was a\n warning-bell in the shack, and when\n a rocketship from Lunar City got\n above the horizon and could send a\n tight beam, the gong clanged loudly,\n and Pop got into a vacuum-suit\n and went out the air lock. He usually\n reached the moondozer about the\n time the ship began to brake for\n landing, and he watched it come in.\n\n\n He saw the silver needle in the\n sky fighting momentum above a line\n of jagged crater-walls. It slowed, and\n slowed, and curved down as it drew\n nearer. The pilot killed all forward\n motion just above the field and came\n steadily and smoothly down to land\n between the silvery triangles that\n marked the landing place.\n\n\n Instantly the rockets cut off,\n drums of fuel and air and food came\n out of the cargo-hatch and Pop swept\n forward with the dozer. It was a\n miniature tractor with a gigantic\n scoop in front. He pushed a great\n mound of talc-fine dust before him\n to cover up the cargo. It was necessary.\n With freight costing what it\n did, fuel and air and food came\n frozen solid, in containers barely\n thicker than foil. While they stayed\n at space-shadow temperature, the foil\n would hold anything. And a cover of\n insulating moondust with vacuum\n between the grains kept even air\n frozen solid, though in sunlight.\n\n\n At such times Pop hardly thought\n of Sattell. He knew he had plenty\n of time for that. He'd started to follow\n Sattell knowing what had happened\n to his wife and children, but\n it was hearsay only. He had no memory\n of them at all. But Sattell stirred\n the lost memories. At first Pop followed\n absorbedly from city to city,\n to recover the years that had been\n wiped out by an axe-blow. He did\n recover a good deal. When Sattell\n fled to another continent, Pop followed\n because he had some distinct\n memories of his wife\u2014and the way\n he'd felt about her\u2014and some fugitive\n mental images of his children.\n When Sattell frenziedly tried to deny\n knowledge of the murder in Tangier,\n Pop had come to remember both his\n children and some of the happiness\n of his married life.\n\n\n Even when Sattell\u2014whimpering\u2014signed\n up for Lunar City, Pop tracked\n him. By that time he was quite\n sure that Sattell was the man who'd\n killed his family. If so, Sattell had\n profited by less than two days' pay\n for wiping out everything that Pop\n possessed. But Pop wanted it back.\n He couldn't prove Sattell's guilt.\n There was no evidence. In any case,\n he didn't really want Sattell to die.\n If he did, there'd be no way to recover\n more lost memories.\n\n\n Sometimes, in the shack on the far\n side of the Moon, Pop Young had\n odd fancies about Sattell. There was\n the mine, for example. In each two\n Earth-weeks of working, the mine-colony\n nearly filled up a three-gallon\n cannister with greasy-seeming white\n crystals shaped like two pyramids\n base to base. The filled cannister\n would weigh a hundred pounds on\n Earth. Here it weighed eighteen. But\n on Earth its contents would be computed\n in carats, and a hundred\n pounds was worth millions. Yet here\n on the Moon Pop kept a waiting cannister\n on a shelf in his tiny dome,\n behind the air-apparatus. It rattled\n if he shook it, and it was worth no\n more than so many pebbles. But\n sometimes Pop wondered if Sattell\n ever thought of the value of the\n mine's production. If he would kill\n a woman and two children and think\n he'd killed a man for no more than\n a hundred dollars, what enormity\n would he commit for a three-gallon\n quantity of uncut diamonds?\nBut he did not dwell on such\n speculation. The sun rose very, very\n slowly in what by convention was\n called the east. It took nearly two\n hours to urge its disk above the\n horizon, and it burned terribly in\n emptiness for fourteen times twenty-four\n hours before sunset. Then there\n was night, and for three hundred\n and thirty-six consecutive hours there\n were only stars overhead and the\n sky was a hole so terrible that a man\n who looked up into it\u2014what with\n the nagging sensation of one-sixth\n gravity\u2014tended to lose all confidence\n in the stability of things. Most men\n immediately found it hysterically necessary\n to seize hold of something\n solid to keep from falling upward.\n But nothing felt solid. Everything\n fell, too. Wherefore most men tended\n to scream.\n\n\n But not Pop. He'd come to the\n Moon in the first place because Sattell\n was here. Near Sattell, he found\n memories of times when he was a\n young man with a young wife who\n loved him extravagantly. Then pictures\n of his children came out of\n emptiness and grew sharp and clear.\n He found that he loved them very\n dearly. And when he was near Sattell\n he literally recovered them\u2014in\n the sense that he came to know new\n things about them and had new\n memories of them every day. He\n hadn't yet remembered the crime\n which lost them to him. Until he\n did\u2014and the fact possessed a certain\n grisly humor\u2014Pop didn't even hate\n Sattell. He simply wanted to be near\n him because it enabled him to recover\n new and vivid parts of his\n youth that had been lost.\n\n\n Otherwise, he was wholly matter-of-fact\u2014certainly\n so for the far side\n of the Moon. He was a rather fussy\n housekeeper. The shack above the\n Big Crack's rim was as tidy as any\n lighthouse or fur-trapper's cabin. He\n tended his air-apparatus with a fine\n precision. It was perfectly simple. In\n the shadow of the shack he had an\n unfailing source of extreme low\n temperature. Air from the shack\n flowed into a shadow-chilled pipe.\n Moisture condensed out of it here,\n and CO\n 2\n froze solidly out of it there,\n and on beyond it collected as restless,\n transparent liquid air. At the same\n time, liquid air from another tank\n evaporated to maintain the proper\n air pressure in the shack. Every so\n often Pop tapped the pipe where the\n moisture froze, and lumps of water\n ice clattered out to be returned to the\n humidifier. Less often he took out the\n CO\n 2\n snow, and measured it, and\n dumped an equivalent quantity of\n pale-blue liquid oxygen into the liquid\n air that had been purified by\n cold. The oxygen dissolved. Then the\n apparatus reversed itself and supplied\n fresh air from the now-enriched\n fluid, while the depleted other\n tank began to fill up with cold-purified\n liquid air.\n\n\n Outside the shack, jagged stony\n pinnacles reared in the starlight, and\n craters complained of the bombardment\n from space that had made them.\n But, outside, nothing ever happened.\n Inside, it was quite different.\n\n\n Working on his memories, one\n day Pop made a little sketch. It\n helped a great deal. He grew deeply\n interested. Writing-material was\n scarce, but he spent most of the time\n between two particular rocket-landings\n getting down on paper exactly\n how a child had looked while sleeping,\n some fifteen years before. He\n remembered with astonishment that\n the child had really looked exactly\n like that! Later he began a sketch of\n his partly-remembered wife. In time\u2014he\n had plenty\u2014it became a really\n truthful likeness.\n\n\n The sun rose, and baked the\n abomination of desolation which was\n the moonscape. Pop Young meticulously\n touched up the glittering\n triangles which were landing guides\n for the Lunar City ships. They glittered\n from the thinnest conceivable\n layer of magnesium marking-powder.\n He checked over the moondozer.\n He tended the air apparatus. He did\n everything that his job and survival\n required. Ungrudgingly.\n\n\n Then he made more sketches. The\n images to be drawn came back more\n clearly when he thought of Sattell,\n so by keeping Sattell in mind he recovered\n the memory of a chair that\n had been in his forgotten home.\n Then he drew his wife sitting in it,\n reading. It felt very good to see her\n again. And he speculated about\n whether Sattell ever thought of millions\n of dollars' worth of new-mined\n diamonds knocking about unguarded\n in the shack, and he suddenly recollected\n clearly the way one of his\n children had looked while playing\n with her doll. He made a quick\n sketch to keep from forgetting that.\n\n\n There was no purpose in the\n sketching, save that he'd lost all his\n young manhood through a senseless\n crime. He wanted his youth back. He\n was recovering it bit by bit. The\n occupation made it absurdly easy to\n live on the surface of the far side of\n the Moon, whether anybody else\n could do it or not.\n\n\n Sattell had no such device for adjusting\n to the lunar state of things.\n Living on the Moon was bad enough\n anyhow, then, but living one mile\n underground from Pop Young was\n much worse. Sattell clearly remembered\n the crime Pop Young hadn't\n yet recalled. He considered that Pop\n had made no overt attempt to revenge\n himself because he planned\n some retaliation so horrible and lingering\n that it was worth waiting for.\n He came to hate Pop with an insane\n ferocity. And fear. In his mind the\n need to escape became an obsession\n on top of the other psychotic states\n normal to a Moon-colonist.\n\n\n But he was helpless. He couldn't\n leave. There was Pop. He couldn't\n kill Pop. He had no chance\u2014and he\n was afraid. The one absurd, irrelevant\n thing he could do was write\n letters back to Earth. He did that.\n He wrote with the desperate, impassioned,\n frantic blend of persuasion\n and information and genius-like invention\n of a prisoner in a high-security\n prison, trying to induce someone\n to help him escape.\n\n\n He had friends, of a sort, but for\n a long time his letters produced\n nothing. The Moon swung in vast\n circles about the Earth, and the Earth\n swung sedately about the Sun. The\n other planets danced their saraband.\n The rest of humanity went about its\n own affairs with fascinated attention.\n But then an event occurred which\n bore directly upon Pop Young and\n Sattell and Pop Young's missing\n years.\n\n\n Somebody back on Earth promoted\n a luxury passenger-line of spaceships\n to ply between Earth and\n Moon. It looked like a perfect set-up.\n Three spacecraft capable of the journey\n came into being with attendant\n reams of publicity. They promised a\n thrill and a new distinction for the\n rich. Guided tours to Lunar! The\n most expensive and most thrilling\n trip in history! One hundred thousand\n dollars for a twelve-day cruise\n through space, with views of the\n Moon's far side and trips through\n Lunar City and a landing in Aristarchus,\n plus sound-tapes of the journey\n and fame hitherto reserved for\n honest explorers!\n\n\n It didn't seem to have anything\n to do with Pop or with Sattell. But\n it did.\n\n\n There were just two passenger\n tours. The first was fully booked.\n But the passengers who paid so highly,\n expected to be pleasantly thrilled\n and shielded from all reasons for\n alarm. And they couldn't be. Something\n happens when a self-centered\n and complacent individual unsuspectingly\n looks out of a spaceship\n port and sees the cosmos unshielded\n by mists or clouds or other aids to\n blindness against reality. It is shattering.\n\n\n A millionaire cut his throat when\n he saw Earth dwindled to a mere\n blue-green ball in vastness. He could\n not endure his own smallness in the\n face of immensity. Not one passenger\n disembarked even for Lunar\n City. Most of them cowered in their\n chairs, hiding their eyes. They were\n the simple cases of hysteria. But the\n richest girl on Earth, who'd had five\n husbands and believed that nothing\n could move her\u2014she went into\n catatonic withdrawal and neither\n saw nor heard nor moved. Two other\n passengers sobbed in improvised\n strait jackets. The first shipload\n started home. Fast.\n\n\n The second luxury liner took off\n with only four passengers and turned\n back before reaching the Moon.\n Space-pilots could take the strain of\n space-flight because they had work\n to do. Workers for the lunar mines\n could make the trip under heavy\n sedation. But it was too early in the\n development of space-travel for\n pleasure-passengers. They weren't\n prepared for the more humbling\n facts of life.\n\n\n Pop heard of the quaint commercial\n enterprise through the micro-tapes\n put off at the shack for the men\n down in the mine. Sattell probably\n learned of it the same way. Pop didn't\n even think of it again. It seemed\n to have nothing to do with him. But\n Sattell undoubtedly dealt with it\n fully in his desperate writings back\n to Earth.\nPop matter-of-factly tended the\n shack and the landing field and the\n stores for the Big Crack mine. Between-times\n he made more drawings\n in pursuit of his own private objective.\n Quite accidentally, he developed\n a certain talent professional artists\n might have approved. But he was not\n trying to communicate, but to discover.\n Drawing\u2014especially with his\n mind on Sattell\u2014he found fresh incidents\n popping up in his recollection.\n Times when he was happy. One\n day he remembered the puppy his\n children had owned and loved. He\n drew it painstakingly\u2014and it was\n his again. Thereafter he could remember\n it any time he chose. He did\n actually recover a completely vanished\n past.\n\n\n He envisioned a way to increase\n that recovery. But there was a marked\n shortage of artists' materials on the\n Moon. All freight had to be hauled\n from Earth, on a voyage equal to\n rather more than a thousand times\n around the equator of the Earth.\n Artists' supplies were not often included.\n Pop didn't even ask.\n\n\n He began to explore the area outside\n the shack for possible material\n no one would think of sending from\n Earth. He collected stones of various\n sorts, but when warmed up in the\n shack they were useless. He found\n no strictly lunar material which\n would serve for modeling or carving\n portraits in the ground. He found\n minerals which could be pulverized\n and used as pigments, but nothing\n suitable for this new adventure in\n the recovery of lost youth. He even\n considered blasting, to aid his search.\n He could. Down in the mine, blasting\n was done by soaking carbon black\u2014from\n CO\n 2\n \u2014in liquid oxygen, and then\n firing it with a spark. It exploded\n splendidly. And its fumes were\n merely more CO\n 2\n which an air-apparatus\n handled easily.\n\n\n He didn't do any blasting. He didn't\n find any signs of the sort of\n mineral he required. Marble would\n have been perfect, but there is no\n marble on the Moon. Naturally! Yet\n Pop continued to search absorbedly\n for material with which to capture\n memory. Sattell still seemed necessary,\n but\u2014\n\n\n Early one lunar morning he was\n a good two miles from his shack\n when he saw rocket-fumes in the\n sky. It was most unlikely. He wasn't\n looking for anything of the sort, but\n out of the corner of his eye he observed\n that something moved. Which\n was impossible. He turned his head,\n and there were rocket-fumes coming\n over the horizon, not in the direction\n of Lunar City. Which was more\n impossible still.\n\n\n He stared. A tiny silver rocket to\n the westward poured out monstrous\n masses of vapor. It decelerated swiftly.\n It curved downward. The rockets\n checked for an instant, and flamed\n again more violently, and checked\n once more. This was not an expert\n approach. It was a faulty one. Curving\n surface-ward in a sharply changing\n parabola, the pilot over-corrected\n and had to wait to gather down-speed,\n and then over-corrected again.\n It was an altogether clumsy landing.\n The ship was not even perfectly vertical\n when it settled not quite in the\n landing-area marked by silvery triangles.\n One of its tail-fins crumpled\n slightly. It tilted a little when fully\n landed.\n\n\n Then nothing happened.\n\n\n Pop made his way toward it in\n the skittering, skating gait one uses\n in one-sixth gravity. When he was\n within half a mile, an air-lock door\n opened in the ship's side. But nothing\n came out of the lock. No space-suited\n figure. No cargo came drifting\n down with the singular deliberation\n of falling objects on the Moon.\n\n\n It was just barely past lunar sunrise\n on the far side of the Moon.\n Incredibly long and utterly black\n shadows stretched across the plain,\n and half the rocketship was dazzling\n white and half was blacker than\n blackness itself. The sun still hung\n low indeed in the black, star-speckled\n sky. Pop waded through moondust,\n raising a trail of slowly settling\n powder. He knew only that the ship\n didn't come from Lunar City, but\n from Earth. He couldn't imagine\n why. He did not even wildly connect\n it with what\u2014say\u2014Sattell might\n have written with desperate plausibility\n about greasy-seeming white\n crystals out of the mine, knocking\n about Pop Young's shack in cannisters\n containing a hundred Earth-pounds\n weight of richness.\nPop reached the rocketship. He\n approached the big tail-fins. On one\n of them there were welded ladder-rungs\n going up to the opened air-lock\n door.\n\n\n He climbed.\n\n\n The air-lock was perfectly normal\n when he reached it. There was a\n glass port in the inner door, and he\n saw eyes looking through it at him.\n He pulled the outer door shut and\n felt the whining vibration of admitted\n air. His vacuum suit went slack\n about him. The inner door began to\n open, and Pop reached up and gave\n his helmet the practiced twisting\n jerk which removed it.\n\n\n Then he blinked. There was a red-headed\n man in the opened door. He\n grinned savagely at Pop. He held a\n very nasty hand-weapon trained on\n Pop's middle.\n\n\n \"Don't come in!\" he said mockingly.\n \"And I don't give a damn\n about how you are. This isn't social.\n It's business!\"\n\n\n Pop simply gaped. He couldn't\n quite take it in.\n\n\n \"This,\" snapped the red-headed\n man abruptly, \"is a stickup!\"\n\n\n Pop's eyes went through the inner\n lock-door. He saw that the interior\n of the ship was stripped and bare.\n But a spiral stairway descended from\n some upper compartment. It had a\n handrail of pure, transparent, water-clear\n plastic. The walls were bare insulation,\n but that trace of luxury remained.\n Pop gazed at the plastic,\n fascinated.\n\n\n The red-headed man leaned forward,\n snarling. He slashed Pop\n across the face with the barrel of his\n weapon. It drew blood. It was wanton,\n savage brutality.\n\n\n \"Pay attention!\" snarled the red-headed\n man. \"A stickup, I said! Get\n it? You go get that can of stuff\n from the mine! The diamonds!\n Bring them here! Understand?\"\n\n\n Pop said numbly: \"What the\n hell?\"\n\n\n The red-headed man hit him\n again. He was nerve-racked, and,\n therefore, he wanted to hurt.\n\n\n \"Move!\" he rasped. \"I want the\n diamonds you've got for the ship\n from Lunar City! Bring 'em!\" Pop\n licked blood from his lips and the\n man with the weapon raged at him.\n \"Then phone down to the mine!\n Tell Sattell I'm here and he can\n come on up! Tell him to bring any\n more diamonds they've dug up since\n the stuff you've got!\"\n\n\n He leaned forward. His face was\n only inches from Pop Young's. It\n was seamed and hard-bitten and\n nerve-racked. But any man would be\n quivering if he wasn't used to space\n or the feel of one-sixth gravity on\n the Moon. He panted:\n\n\n \"And get it straight! You try\n any tricks and we take off! We\n swing over your shack! The rocket-blast\n smashes it! We burn you\n down! Then we swing over the cable\n down to the mine and the rocket-flame\n melts it! You die and everybody\n in the mine besides! No tricks!\n We didn't come here for nothing!\"\n\n\n He twitched all over. Then he\n struck cruelly again at Pop Young's\n face. He seemed filled with fury, at\n least partly hysterical. It was the tension\n that space-travel\u2014then, at its\n beginning\u2014produced. It was meaningless\n savagery due to terror. But,\n of course, Pop was helpless to resent\n it. There were no weapons on the\n Moon and the mention of Sattell's\n name showed the uselessness of bluff.\n He'd pictured the complete set-up\n by the edge of the Big Crack. Pop\n could do nothing.\n\n\n The red-headed man checked\n himself, panting. He drew back and\n slammed the inner lock-door. There\n was the sound of pumping.\n\n\n Pop put his helmet back on and\n sealed it. The outer door opened.\n Outrushing air tugged at Pop. After\n a second or two he went out and\n climbed down the welded-on ladder-bars\n to the ground.\n\n\n He headed back toward his shack.\n Somehow, the mention of Sattell had\n made his mind work better. It always\n did. He began painstakingly to\n put things together. The red-headed\n man knew the routine here in every\n detail. He knew Sattell. That part\n was simple. Sattell had planned this\n multi-million-dollar coup, as a man\n in prison might plan his break. The\n stripped interior of the ship identified\n it.\n\n\n It was one of the unsuccessful\n luxury-liners sold for scrap. Or perhaps\n it was stolen for the journey\n here. Sattell's associates had had to\n steal or somehow get the fuel, and\n somehow find a pilot. But there were\n diamonds worth at least five million\n dollars waiting for them, and the\n whole job might not have called for\n more than two men\u2014with Sattell as\n a third. According to the economics\n of crime, it was feasible. Anyhow it\n was being done.\n\n\n Pop reached the dust-heap which\n was his shack and went in the air\n lock. Inside, he went to the vision-phone\n and called the mine-colony\n down in the Crack. He gave the\n message he'd been told to pass on.\n Sattell to come up, with what diamonds\n had been dug since the\n regular cannister was sent up for the\n Lunar City ship that would be due\n presently. Otherwise the ship on the\n landing strip would destroy shack\n and Pop and the colony together.\n\n\n \"I'd guess,\" said Pop painstakingly,\n \"that Sattell figured it out. He's\n probably got some sort of gun to\n keep you from holding him down\n there. But he won't know his friends\n are here\u2014not right this minute he\n won't.\"\n\n\n A shaking voice asked questions\n from the vision-phone.\n\n\n \"No,\" said Pop, \"they'll do it anyhow.\n If we were able to tell about\n 'em, they'd be chased. But if I'm\n dead and the shacks smashed and\n the cable burnt through, they'll be\n back on Earth long before a new\n cable's been got and let down to you.\n So they'll do all they can no matter\n what I do.\" He added, \"I wouldn't\n tell Sattell a thing about it, if I were\n you. It'll save trouble. Just let him\n keep on waiting for this to happen.\n It'll save you trouble.\"\n\n\n Another shaky question.\n\n\n \"Me?\" asked Pop. \"Oh, I'm going\n to raise what hell I can. There's\n some stuff in that ship I want.\"\n\n\n He switched off the phone. He\n went over to his air apparatus. He\n took down the cannister of diamonds\n which were worth five millions or\n more back on Earth. He found a\n bucket. He dumped the diamonds\n casually into it. They floated downward\n with great deliberation and\n surged from side to side like a liquid\n when they stopped. One-sixth gravity.\n\n\n Pop regarded his drawings meditatively.\n A sketch of his wife as he\n now remembered her. It was very\n good to remember. A drawing of his\n two children, playing together. He\n looked forward to remembering\n much more about them. He grinned.\n\n\n \"That stair-rail,\" he said in deep\n satisfaction. \"That'll do it!\"\n\n\n He tore bed linen from his bunk\n and worked on the emptied cannister.\n It was a double container with a\n thermware interior lining. Even on\n Earth newly-mined diamonds sometimes\n fly to pieces from internal\n stress. On the Moon, it was not desirable\n that diamonds be exposed to\n repeated violent changes of temperature.\n So a thermware-lined cannister\n kept them at mine-temperature once\n they were warmed to touchability.\n\n\n Pop packed the cotton cloth in the\n container. He hurried a little, because\n the men in the rocket were shaky and\n might not practice patience. He took\n a small emergency-lamp from his\n spare spacesuit. He carefully cracked\n its bulb, exposing the filament within.\n He put the lamp on top of the\n cotton and sprinkled magnesium\n marking-powder over everything.\n Then he went to the air-apparatus\n and took out a flask of the liquid\n oxygen used to keep his breathing-air\n in balance. He poured the frigid,\n pale-blue stuff into the cotton. He\n saturated it.\n\n\n All the inside of the shack was\n foggy when he finished. Then he\n pushed the cannister-top down. He\n breathed a sigh of relief when it was\n in place. He'd arranged for it to\n break a frozen-brittle switch as it\n descended. When it came off, the\n switch would light the lamp with its\n bare filament. There was powdered\n magnesium in contact with it and\n liquid oxygen all about.\n\n\n He went out of the shack by the\n air lock. On the way, thinking about\n Sattell, he suddenly recovered a completely\n new memory. On their first\n wedding anniversary, so long ago,\n he and his wife had gone out to\n dinner to celebrate. He remembered\n how she looked: the almost-smug\n joy they shared that they would be\n together for always, with one complete\n year for proof.\n\n\n Pop reflected hungrily that it was\n something else to be made permanent\n and inspected from time to time.\n But he wanted more than a drawing\n of this! He wanted to make the memory\n permanent and to extend it\u2014\n\n\n If it had not been for his vacuum\n suit and the cannister he carried, Pop\n would have rubbed his hands.\nTall, jagged crater-walls rose\n from the lunar plain. Monstrous, extended\n inky shadows stretched\n enormous distances, utterly black.\n The sun, like a glowing octopod,\n floated low at the edge of things and\n seemed to hate all creation.\n\n\n Pop reached the rocket. He\n climbed the welded ladder-rungs to\n the air lock. He closed the door. Air\n whined. His suit sagged against his\n body. He took off his helmet.\n\n\n When the red-headed man opened\n the inner door, the hand-weapon\n shook and trembled. Pop said\n calmly:\n\n\n \"Now I've got to go handle the\n hoist, if Sattell's coming up from\n the mine. If I don't do it, he don't\n come up.\"\n\n\n The red-headed man snarled. But\n his eyes were on the cannister whose\n contents should weigh a hundred\n pounds on Earth.\n\n\n \"Any tricks,\" he rasped, \"and you\n know what happens!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" said Pop.\n\n\n He stolidly put his helmet back\n on. But his eyes went past the red-headed\n man to the stair that wound\n down, inside the ship, from some\n compartment above. The stair-rail was\n pure, clear, water-white plastic, not\n less than three inches thick. There\n was a lot of it!\n\n\n The inner door closed. Pop opened\n the outer. Air rushed out. He\n climbed painstakingly down to the\n ground. He started back toward the\n shack.\n\n\n There was the most luridly bright\n of all possible flashes. There was no\n sound, of course. But something\n flamed very brightly, and the ground\n thumped under Pop Young's vacuum\n boots. He turned.\n\n\n The rocketship was still in the act\n of flying apart. It had been a splendid\n explosion. Of course cotton sheeting\n in liquid oxygen is not quite as\n good an explosive as carbon-black,\n which they used down in the mine.\n Even with magnesium powder to\n start the flame when a bare light-filament\n ignited it, the cannister-bomb\n hadn't equaled\u2014say\u2014T.N.T.\n But the ship had fuel on board for\n the trip back to Earth. And it blew,\n too. It would be minutes before all\n the fragments of the ship returned\n to the Moon's surface. On the Moon,\n things fall slowly.\n\n\n Pop didn't wait. He searched\n hopefully. Once a mass of steel plating\n fell only yards from him, but it\n did not interrupt his search.\n\n\n When he went into the shack, he\n grinned to himself. The call-light of\n the vision-phone flickered wildly.\n When he took off his helmet the bell\n clanged incessantly. He answered. A\n shaking voice from the mining-colony\n panted:\n\n\n \"We felt a shock! What happened?\n What do we do?\"\n\n\n \"Don't do a thing,\" advised Pop.\n \"It's all right. I blew up the ship and\n everything's all right. I wouldn't\n even mention it to Sattell if I were\n you.\"\n\n\n He grinned happily down at a section\n of plastic stair-rail he'd found\n not too far from where the ship exploded.\n When the man down in the\n mine cut off, Pop got out of his\n vacuum suit in a hurry. He placed\n the plastic zestfully on the table\n where he'd been restricted to drawing\n pictures of his wife and children\n in order to recover memories of\n them.\n\n\n He began to plan, gloatingly, the\n thing he would carve out of a four-inch\n section of the plastic. When it\n was carved, he'd paint it. While he\n worked, he'd think of Sattell, because\n that was the way to get back the\n missing portions of his life\u2014the\n parts Sattell had managed to get\n away from him. He'd get back more\n than ever, now!\n\n\n He didn't wonder what he'd do\n if he ever remembered the crime\n Sattell had committed. He felt, somehow,\n that he wouldn't get that back\n until he'd recovered all the rest.\n\n\n Gloating, it was amusing to remember\n what people used to call\n such art-works as he planned, when\n carved by other lonely men in other\n faraway places. They called those\n sculptures scrimshaw.\n\n\n But they were a lot more than\n that!\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAstounding Science Fiction\nSeptember\n 1955.
