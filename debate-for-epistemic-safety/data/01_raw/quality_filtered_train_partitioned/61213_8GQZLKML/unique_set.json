  "article": "THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE\nby FRITZ LEIBER\nThe machine was not perfect. It\n\n could be tricked. It could make\n\n mistakes. And\u2014it could learn!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nSilently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed\n young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the\nChicago Space Mirror\nthat there would be all sorts of human interest\n stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess\n tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.\n\n\n Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that\n was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited\n men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,\n were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian\n features, and talked foreign languages.\n\n\n They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying\n individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.\n\n\n Chess sets were everywhere\u2014big ones on tables, still bigger\n diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from\n side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational\n ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny\n magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.\n\n\n There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:\n FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about\n the last three.\n\n\n The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar\n note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over\n their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That\n Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck\n Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance.\nHer last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the\n first American manned circum-lunar satellite\u2014and the five alternate\n pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra\n much further out of the world.\n\n\n Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English\n were not particularly helpful. Samples:\n\n\n \"They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure\n Barcza System and Indian Defenses\u2014and the Dragon Formation if anyone\n pushes the King Pawn.\"\n\n\n \"Hah! In that case....\"\n\n\n \"The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and\n they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey\n computer do against four Russian grandmasters?\"\n\n\n \"I heard the Russians have been programmed\u2014with hypnotic cramming and\n somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Machine hasn't even a\nHaupturnier\nor an intercollegiate\n won. It'll over its head be playing.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler\n at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.\"\n\n\n \"Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and\n Circum-Terra?\"\n\n\n \"Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.\"\n\n\n Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about\n the game of chess\u2014a point that she had slid over in conferring with\n the powers at the\nSpace Mirror\n, but that now had begun to weigh on\n her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,\n find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way.\n\"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?\"\n\n\n \"You're durn tootin' she would!\" Sandra replied in a rush, and then\n looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.\n\n\n It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat\n thinned down Peter Lorre\u2014there was that same impression of the happy\n Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,\n making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in\n sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing\n a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's\u2014a\n circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow\n conspirators.\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute,\" she protested just the same. He had already taken\n her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide\n stairs. \"How did you know I wanted a drink?\"\n\n\n \"I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,\" he\n replied, keeping them moving. \"Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your\n lovely throat.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here.\"\n\n\n \"But of course.\" They were already mounting the stairs. \"What would\n chess be without coffee or schnapps?\"\n\n\n \"Okay, lead on,\" Sandra said. \"You're the doctor.\"\n\n\n \"Doctor?\" He smiled widely. \"You know, I like being called that.\"\n\n\n \"Then the name is yours as long as you want it\u2014Doc.\"\nMeanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small\n cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.\n He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned\n waiter materialized.\n\n\n \"For myself black coffee,\" he said. \"For mademoiselle rhine wine and\n seltzer?\"\n\n\n \"That'd go fine.\" Sandra leaned back. \"Confidentially, Doc, I was\n having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.\"\n\n\n He nodded. \"You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by\n chess,\" he assured her. \"It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game\n for lunatics\u2014or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and\n beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?\"\n\n\n Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they\n were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.\n\n\n \"You have one great advantage,\" he told her. \"You know nothing\n whatsoever of chess\u2014so you will be able to write about it\n understandably for your readers.\" He swallowed half his demitasse and\n smacked his lips. \"As for the Machine\u2014you\ndo\nknow, I suppose, that\n it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking\n like a late medieval knight in armor?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Doc, but....\" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.\n\n\n \"Wait.\" He lifted a finger. \"I think I know what you're going to ask.\n You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work\n perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?\"\n\n\n Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as\n comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.\n\n\n He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced\n them.\n\n\n \"If you had,\" he said, \"a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,\n it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just\n to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the\n time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for\n White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to\n trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine\n can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the\n likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead\u2014that is, four moves\n each for White and Black\u2014and then decide which is the best move on the\n basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing\n a powerful central position and so on.\"\n\"That sounds like the way a man would play a game,\" Sandra observed.\n \"Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting\n out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" Doc beamed at her approvingly. \"The Machine\nis\nlike a\n man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always\n abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of\n genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human\n interest already, even in the Machine.\"\n\n\n Sandra nodded. \"Does a human chess player\u2014a grandmaster, I mean\u2014ever\n look eight moves ahead in a game?\"\n\n\n \"Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a\n chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines\n many more moves ahead than that\u2014thirty or forty even. The Machine\n is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something\n of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World\n Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the\n possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can\n only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and\n experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the\n directions fed into it before it plays a game.\"\n\n\n \"You mean the programming?\"\n\n\n \"Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the\n chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by\n Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves\n ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab\n at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It\n had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub\u2014a\n dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing\n material\u2014but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.\n The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as\n fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new\n transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn\n depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute\n zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead\n and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.\"\n\n\n \"A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it\n only sees twice as many moves ahead?\" Sandra objected.\n\n\n \"There is a geometrical progression involved there,\" he told her\n with a smile. \"Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when\n you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of\n thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games\n by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves\n ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,\n you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.\"\n\n\n \"Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!\"\n\n\n A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,\n gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc\n and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue.\nSandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look\n down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the\n middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely\n apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set\n out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,\n about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people\n still wandering about.\n\n\n On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the\n corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White\n squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.\n\n\n One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other\n four\u2014the one above the Machine.\n\n\n Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine\u2014a\n bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny\n telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on\n little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about\n ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of\n them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were\n attaching it to the Siamese clock.\n\n\n Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but\n only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who\n never made a mistake....\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.\"\n\n\n She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.\n\n\n \"I should tell you, Igor,\" Doc continued, \"that Miss Grayling\n represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you\n have a message for her readers.\"\n\n\n The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. \"I most certainly do!\" At that\n moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.\n Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray\n with a flourish and drew himself up.\n\"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,\" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his\n eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, \"that I, Igor Jandorf,\n will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!\n Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold\u2014I, who\n have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I\n have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit\u2014an offer no\n true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict\n that the Machine will play like a great oaf\u2014at least against\nme\n.\n Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,\n will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh yes,\" Sandra assured him, \"but there are some other questions I\n very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.\"\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten\n minutes they start the clocks.\"\n\n\n While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's\n playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.\n\n\n \"One expects it of Jandorf,\" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic\n shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. \"At least he didn't take your\n wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess\n master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.\"\n\n\n \"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I\n haven't offended Mis\u2014Master Jandorf so that he doesn't\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a\n press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.\n That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds\n to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to\n look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a\n very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the\n usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?\" Sandra interrupted.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his\n moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his\n clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,\n he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine\n will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time\n on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4\n minutes a move\u2014and it will need every second of them! Incidentally\n it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold\n challenge\u2014just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or\nis\nthe Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?\"\n\n\n \"Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf\n has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that.\"\n\"Of course not!\" Doc assured her. \"It was only 49 and he lost two of\n those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood.\"\n\n\n \"He's one of the Russians, isn't he?\" Sandra asked. \"Igor?\"\n\n\n Doc chuckled. \"Not exactly,\" he said gently. \"He is originally a Pole\n and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?\"\n\n\n Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists\n of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard.\nTHE PLAYERS\nWilliam Angler, USA\n\n Bela Grabo, Hungary\n\n Ivan Jal, USSR\n\n Igor Jandorf, Argentina\n\n Dr. S.

Oh, he's the boy wonder,\n isn't he?\"\n\n\n Doc nodded. \"Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of\n the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting\n to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the\n United States while still technically a minor\u2014Master William Augustus\n Angler.\"\n\n\n A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old\n man back into his chair.\n\n\n \"How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?\" he demanded. \"Still chasing the\n girls, I see.\"\n\n\n \"Please, Willie, get off me.\"\n\n\n \"Can't take it, huh?\" Angler straightened up somewhat. \"Hey waiter!\n Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it\nnext\nyear. About that\nex-\n, though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed.\"\n\n\n \"Willie!\" Doc said with some asperity. \"Miss Grayling is a journalist.\n She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play\n against the Machine.\"\nAngler grinned and shook his head sadly. \"Poor old Machine,\" he said.\n \"I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of\n tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of\n moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too\n fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the\n hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first\n prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account.\"\n\n\n \"I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler,\" Sandra said rapidly,\n \"but if after the playing session you could grant me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, babe,\" Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. \"I'm dated up\n for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!\" And he went\n charging off.\n\n\n Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\n \"Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?\" she said.\n\n\n Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. \"You must excuse\n them, though,\" he said. \"They really get so little recognition or\n recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal\n of ego to play greatly.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this\n tournament?\"\n\n\n \"Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.\n They want to score a point over their great rival.\"\n\n\n \"But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,\"\n Sandra pointed out.\n\n\n \"True,\" Doc agreed thoughtfully. \"WBM must feel very sure.... It's\n the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's\n greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off\n in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize\n money is fabulous\u2014$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all\n expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.\n Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded\n her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players\n are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's\nFederation Internationale\n des Echecs\n\u2014the international chess organization) are also backing\n the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little\n prestige now that its space program is sagging.\"\n\n\n \"But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for\n them.\"\n\n\n Doc frowned. \"True, in a sense.\nThey\nmust feel very sure.... Here\n they are now.\"\nFour men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,\n toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be\n going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of\n a phalanx.\n\n\n \"The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,\" Doc told her. \"It isn't often\n that you see the current champion of the world\u2014Votbinnik\u2014and an\n ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament\n who have held that honor\u2014Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.\"\n\n\n \"Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?\"\n\n\n \"Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches\u2014a very long\n business\u2014after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.\n This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every\n other player. That means nine rounds.\"\n\n\n \"Anyway there\nare\nan awful lot of Russians in the tournament,\"\n Sandra said, consulting her program. \"Four out of ten have USSR after\n them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary\u2014that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and\n Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.\"\n\n\n \"The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament\n represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength\n between the two countries,\" Doc said judiciously. \"Chess mastery\n moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems\n and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a\n hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria\n and the New World. Now it's Russia\u2014including of course the Russians\n who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of\n good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,\n there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't\n think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking\n Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short\n bald-headed man?\"\n\n\n \"You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.\n Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox\n Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown.\" He\n chuckled. \"Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told\n Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine\n because it is technically a\ngolem\n\u2014the clay Frankenstein's monster of\n Hebrew legend.\"\n\n\n Sandra asked, \"What about Grabo and Krakatower?\"\nDoc gave a short scornful laugh. \"Krakatower! Don't pay any attention\n to\nhim\n. A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play\n in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them\n that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they\n had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down\n on his knees and cried\u2014and all the time his eyes on that expense money\n and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically\n of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old\n Krakatower.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting\n article? Can you point him out to me?\"\n\n\n \"You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't\n see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.\n It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of\n youthfulness.\"\n\n\n \"And Grabo?\" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of\n Doc's animosity.\n\n\n Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. \"About Bela Grabo (why are three out of\n four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a\n very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn\n him as its first opponent.\"\n\n\n He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.\n\n\n \"This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous\n physicist, I suppose?\"\n\n\n \"By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing\n machines\u2014they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a\n psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's\n chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him\n for the programming job. Let me tell you\u2014No, better yet\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,\n \"Simon!\"\n\n\n A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.\n\n\n \"What is it, Savilly?\" he asked. \"There's hardly any time, you know.\"\nThe newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with\n graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.\n\n\n Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.\n\n\n Simon Great smiled thinly. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"But I am making no\n predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the\n programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the\n Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that\n and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the\n Machine at adjournments\u2014only between games (I did insist on that and\n get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps\n running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs\u2014if they can work\n fast enough.\"\n\n\n \"That makes it very tough on you,\" Sandra put in. \"The Machine isn't\n allowed any weaknesses.\"\n\n\n Great nodded soberly. \"And now I must go. They've almost finished the\n count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased\n to have met you, Miss Grayling\u2014I'll check with our PR man on that\n interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.\"\n\n\n The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.\n Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the\n grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.\n Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards\n lit up with the pieces in the opening position\u2014white for White and red\n for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash\n bulbs went off.\n\n\n \"You know, Doc,\" Sandra said, \"I'm a dog to suggest this, but what\n if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really\n playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his\n electricians to rig\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc laughed happily\u2014and so loudly that some people at the adjoining\n tables frowned.\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for\n a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.\n No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such\n a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament\n play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between\n a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style\n is remembered and would be recognized\u2014though, come to think of it, his\n style was often described as being machinelike....\" For a moment Doc's\n eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. \"But no, the idea is\n impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three\n games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately\n and has grandmaster skill.\"\n\n\n \"Did the Machine beat him?\" Sandra asked.\nDoc shrugged. \"The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.\n But about your idea, Miss Grayling\u2014did you ever read about Maelzel's\n famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was\n supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but\n actually it had a man hidden inside it\u2014your Edgar Poe exposed the\n fraud in a famous article. In\nmy\nstory I think the chess robot will\n break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser\n and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up\n and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a\n better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce\n too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr\n kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear\n when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find\n yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle\n its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can\n imagine....\"\n\n\n While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess\n stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort\n evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical\n doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the\n Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.\n\n\n He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that\n she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.\n Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old\n guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff\n this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the\n umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought\n that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used\n dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,\n old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....\n\n\n She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.\n\n\n Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at\n them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed\n position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on\n four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between\n the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man\n hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost\n tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials.\nLike morticians'\n assistants\n, she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at\n the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,\n his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if\n she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.\n\n\n The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. \"Sir!\" he said agitatedly.\n \"Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?\"\n",
