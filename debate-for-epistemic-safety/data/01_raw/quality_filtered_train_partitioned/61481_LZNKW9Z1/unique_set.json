  "article": "SILENCE IS\u2014DEADLY\nBy Bertrand L. Shurtleff\nRadio is an absolute necessity in modern\n\n organization\u2014and particularly in modern\n\n naval organization. If you could silence all\n\n radio\u2014silence of that sort would be deadly!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Astounding Science-Fiction April 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThe hurried\nrat-a-tat\nof knuckles hammered on the cabin door.\n Commander Bob Curtis roused himself from his doze, got up from his\n chair, stretched himself to his full, lanky height and yawned. That\n would be Nelson, his navigating officer. Nelson always knocked that\n way\u2014like a man in an external state of jitters over nothing at all.\n\n\n Curtis didn't hurry. It pleased him to let Nelson wait. He moved slowly\n to the door, paused there, and flung a backward glance at the man in\n the cabin with him\u2014Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest\n of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser\nComerford\n.\n\n\n The wizened face of the older man was molded in intent lines of\n concentration, as his bushy gray head bent over his drawing board.\n Curtis got a glimpse of the design on which he was working, and his\n lips relaxed in a faint smile.\n\n\n Androka had arrived on board the\nComerford\nthe day before she sailed\n from Norfolk. With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and\n equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks,\n which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over\n his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours\n daily in the room in the superstructure that had been assigned as his\n laboratory.\n\n\n Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky\u2014a scientist\n whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country\n under the domination of the Nazi\ngestapo\n. At other times, the man\n seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer\u2014a mad genius!\n\n\n Curtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face\n like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of\n clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.\n\n\n His eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before\n him. It\nwas\nNelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down\n over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands\n fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white\n cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.\n\n\n The fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a\n black-browed bos'n's mate named Joe Bradford\u2014the worst trouble maker\n on board. But there was no question of his ability. He was a good\n navigating officer\u2014dependable, accurate, conscientious. Nevertheless,\n his taut face, restless, searching eyes, and eternally nervous manner\n got Curtis' goat.\n\n\n \"Come in, Nelson!\" he said.\n\n\n Nelson shouldered his way inside, and stood there in his dripping\n oilskins, blinking his eyes against the yellow light.\n\n\n Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor\n Androka, with a quizzical grin. \"Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working\n hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish\n the Czech Republic!\"\n\n\n Nelson had no answering smile, although there had been a great deal\n of good-natured joking aboard the\nComerford\never since the navy\n department had sent the scientist on board the cruiser to carry on his\n experiments.\n\n\n \"I'm worried, sir!\" Nelson said. \"I'm not sure about my dead reckoning.\n This storm\u2014\"\n\n\n Curtis threw his arm around Nelson's dripping shoulders. \"Forget it!\n Don't let a little error get you down!\"\n\n\n \"But this storm, sir!\" Nelson avoided Curtis' friendly eyes and slipped\n out from under his arm. \"It's got me worried. Quartering wind of\n undetermined force, variable and gusty. There's a chop to the sea\u2014as\n if from unestimated currents among the islets. No chance to check by\n observation, and now there is a chance\u2014look at me!\"\n\n\n He held out his hands. They were shaking as if he had the chills.\n\n\n \"You say there is a chance?\" Curtis asked. \"Stars out?\"\n\n\n \"As if by providence, sir, there's a clear patch. I'm wondering\u2014\" His\n voice trailed off, but his eyes swung toward the gleaming sextant on\n the rack.\n\n\n Commander Curtis shrugged good-naturedly and reached for the\n instrument. \"Not that I've lost confidence in you, Nels, but just\n because you asked for it!\"\nCurtis donned his slicker and went outside, sextant in hand. In a few\n minutes he returned and handed Nelson a sheet of paper with figures\n underlined heavily.\n\n\n \"Here's what I make it,\" the commander told his navigating officer.\n \"Bet you're not off appreciably.\"\n\n\n Nelson stared at the computations with shaking head. Then he mutely\n held up his own.\n\n\n Curtis stared, frowned, grabbed his own sheet again. \"Any time I'm\n that far off old Figure-'em Nelson's estimate, I'm checking back,\" he\n declared, frowning at the two papers and hastily rechecking his own\n figures.\n\n\n \"Call up to the bridge to stop her,\" he told Nelson. \"We can't afford\n to move in these waters with such a possibility of error!\"\n\n\n Nelson complied, and the throbbing drive of the engines lessened\n at once. Nelson said: \"I've been wondering, sir, if it wouldn't be\n advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks\n and islets\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Radio?\" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the\n other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship's discipline.\n \"You're using your radio?\" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen\n old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. \"Go ahead and try it. See\n how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor\n Androka decrees silence over the German airways! Try it! Try it, I say!\"\n\n\n Bob Curtis stared at him, as if questioning his sanity. Then he\n hastened to the radio room, with Nelson at his heels, and the Czech\n trotting along behind.\n\n\n The door burst open as they neared it. A frightened operator came out,\n still wearing his earphones, and stood staring upward incredulously at\n the a\u00ebrial.\n\n\n \"Get us a radio cross-bearing for location at once,\" Curtis said\n sharply, for the operator seemed in a daze.\n\n\n \"Bearing, sir?\" The man brought his eyes down with difficulty, as if\n still dissatisfied. \"I'm sorry, sir, but the outfit's dead. Went out on\n me about five minutes ago. I was taking the weather report when the set\n conked. I was trying to see if something's wrong.\"\n\n\n The Czech inventor giggled. Curtis gave him another curious look and\n thrust himself into the radio room.\n\n\n \"Try again!\" he told the operator. \"See what you can get!\"\n\n\n The radio man leaped to his seat and tried frantically. Again and\n again, he sent off a request for a cross-bearing from shore stations\n that had recently been established to insure safety to naval vessels,\n but there was no answer on any of the bands\u2014not even the blare of a\n high-powered commercial program in the higher reach, nor the chatter of\n ships or amateurs on the shorter.\n\n\n \"Dead!\" Androka muttered, with a bitter laugh. \"Yet not dead,\n gentlemen! The set is uninjured. The waves are what have been upset. I\n have shattered them around your ship, just as I can eventually shatter\n them all over Central Europe! For the next two hours, no radio messages\n can enter or leave my zone of radio silence\u2014of refracted radio waves,\n set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!\"\nThere was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him.\n Curtis was the first to speak.\n\n\n \"Your secrecy might well cost the United States navy one of its best\n light cruisers\u2014and us our lives!\" he said angrily. \"We need that check\n by radio at once! If you're not talking nonsense, call off your dogs\n till we learn just where we are!\"\n\n\n Androka held out his palms helplessly. \"I can do nothing. I have given\n orders to my assistant that he must keep two hours of radio silence! I\n can get no message to him, for our radio is dead!\"\n\n\n As if to mock him, the ship's radio began to answer:\n\n\n \"Station 297 calling U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\n. Station 297 calling U.\n S. Cruiser\nComerford\n\u2014\"\n\n\n \"U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\ncalling Station 297!\" the operator intoned,\n winking at the two officers over Androka's discomfiture, and asked for\n the bearings.\n\n\n The answer came back: \"Bearings north east by a quarter east, U. S.\n Cruiser\nComerford\n!\"\n\n\n Curtis sighed with relief. He saw that Nelson was staring fiercely\n at the radio operator, as the man went on calling: \"U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\ncalling Station 364. U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\ncalling\n Station 364\u2014\"\n\n\n Then the instrument rasped again: \"Station 364 calling U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\n. Bearings north west by three west. Bearings north west by\n three west, U. S. Cruiser\nComerford\nfrom Cay 364.\"\n\n\n Commander and navigator had both scribbled verifications of the\n numbers. Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his\n disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence, they\n raced for the chart room.\nQuickly the parallels stepped off the bearing from the designated\n points. Light intersecting lines proclaimed a check on their position.\n\n\n Curtis frowned and shook his head. Slowly he forced a reluctant grin as\n he stuck out his hand.\n\n\n \"Shake, Nels,\" he said. \"It's my turn to eat crow. You and the radio\n must be right. Continue as you were!\"\n\n\n \"I'm relieved, sir, just the same,\" Nelson admitted, \"to have the radio\n bearings. We'd have piled up sure if you'd been right.\"\n\n\n They went on through the night. The starlit gap in the clouds had\n closed. The sky was again a blanket of darkness pouring sheets of rain\n at them.\n\n\n Nelson went back to the bridge, and Androka returned to the commander's\n cabin. Curtis lingered in the wireless room with the radio operator.\n\n\n \"It's a funny thing,\" the latter said, still dialing and grousing, \"how\n I got that cross-bearing through and can't get another squeak out of\n her. I'm wondering if that old goat really\nhas\ndone something to the\n ether. The set seems O. K.\"\n\n\n He lingered over the apparatus, checking and rechecking. Tubes lighted;\n wires were alive to the touch and set him to shaking his head at the\n tingle they sent through his inquiring fingers.\n\n\n Curtis left him at it, and went to rejoin Androka in the cabin. He\n found the little inventor pacing up and down, shaking his fists in the\n air; pausing every now and then to run his bony fingers through his\n tangled mop of gray hair, or to claw nervously at his beard.\n\n\n \"You have seen a miracle, commander!\" he shouted at Curtis. \"\nMy\nmiracle! My invention has shattered the ether waves hereabouts\n hopelessly.\"\n\n\n \"Seems to me,\" Curtis said dryly, \"this invention can harm your friends\n as much as your enemies.\"\n\n\n The scientist drew himself up to his full height\u2014which was only a\n little over five feet. His voice grew shrill. \"Wait! Just wait! There\n are other inventions to supplement this one. Put them together, and\n they will defeat the Nazi hordes which have ravaged my country!\"\n\n\n Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka's\n eyes, under their bushy brows. There was something of the wild animal\n in the man's expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.\n\n\n \"Those tanks you have below,\" Curtis said, \"have they some connection\n with this radio silence?\"\n\n\n A far-away look came into Androka's eyes. He did not seem to hear\n the question. He lowered his voice: \"My daughter is still in Prague.\n So are my sister and her husband, and\ntheir\ntwo daughters. If the\ngestapo\nknew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You\n understand\u2014better dead?\"\n\n\n Curtis said: \"I understand.\"\n\n\n \"And if the Nazi agents in America knew of the islet from which my zone\n of silence is projected\u2014\" Androka paused, his head tilted to one side,\n as if he were listening to something\u2014\nOn deck, there was shouting and commotion. Curtis rushed out, pulling\n on his slicker as he went. The shout from the watch forward had been\n picked up, and was being relayed all over the ship. The words struck on\n Curtis' ears with a note of impending tragedy.\n\n\n \"Breakers ahead!\"\n\n\n He was beside Navigating Officer Nelson on the bridge, and saw the\n helmsman climbing the rapidly spinning wheel like a monkey as he put it\n hard aport.\n\n\n Then the ship struck. Everything movable shot ahead until it brought up\n at the end of a swing or smacked against something solid.\n\n\n Curtis felt Nelson's hand grip his shoulder, as he put his lips close\n to his ear and shouted: \"You must have been right, sir, and the radio\n bearings and my reckoning wrong. We've hit that reef a terrific smack.\n I'm afraid we're gored!\"\n\n\n \"Get out the collision mat!\" Curtis ordered. \"We ought to be able to\n keep her up!\"\n\n\n And then he became aware of a deadly stillness. A vast wall of silence\n enveloped the entire cruiser. Looking over the side, he could no longer\n see the waves that a few minutes before had beaten savagely against the\n ship.\n\n\n The\nComerford\nwas shrouded in a huge pall of yellowish-gray mist, and\n more of it was coming up from below\u2014from ventilators and hatchways and\n skylights\u2014as if the whole ship were flooded with some evil vapor.\n\n\n Somehow, Curtis' mind flashed to the stories he'd heard of the forts of\n the Maginot Line, and of other forts in Holland and Belgium that had\n fallen before the early Nazi blitzkrieg, when their defenders found\n themselves struck numb and helpless by a gas that had been flooded into\n the inner compartments of their strongholds.\n\n\n There were those who said it was the work of sappers who had tunneled\n under the foundations, while others laid the induction of the gas to\n Fifth Column traitors. There were a hundred more or less plausible\n explanations\u2014\n\n\n The vapor clouds that enveloped the\nComerford\nwere becoming thicker.\n All about the deck lay the forms of unconscious seamen, suddenly\n stricken helpless. And then Curtis saw other forms flitting about the\n deck\u2014forms that looked like creatures from another world, but he\n recognized them for what they were\u2014men wearing gas masks.\n\n\n Nelson was nowhere in sight. The steersman lay in a limp heap beside\n the swinging wheel. Then a gas-masked figure appeared through the\n shroud of mist and steadied it, so that the cruiser would not be\n completely at the mercy of the wind and the waves.\n\n\n Curtis heard the anchor let down, as if by invisible hands, the chain\n screaming and flailing its clanking way through the hawse hole. Then he\n was completely walled in by the yellowish-gray mist. He felt his senses\n swimming.\n\n\n Voices droned all around him in mumbling confusion\u2014guttural voices\n that ebbed and flowed in a tide of excited talk. He caught a word of\n English now and then, mixed in with a flood of Teuton phonetics.\n\n\n Two words, in particular, registered clearly on his mind. One was\n \"\nCarethusia\n\"; the other was \"convoy.\" But gradually his eardrums\n began to throb, as if someone were pounding on them from the inside. He\n couldn't get his breath; a cloud seemed to be mounting within him until\n it swept over his brain\u2014\n\n\n He felt something strike the side of his head, and realized that he had\n fallen in a heap on the bridge. And after that, he wasn't conscious of\n anything\u2014\nThe rain had abated to a foggy drizzle. The wash of the surf swung the\nComerford\nin a lazy, rolling motion, as she lay with her bow nosing\n into the sandbar at the entrance of the inlet.\n\n\n From her bridge, Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked\n figures moving about the decks, descending companionways\u2014like goblins\n from an ancient fairy tale or a modern horror story. Nelson looked like\n a goblin himself, with his face covered by a respirator. At his side,\n stood his fellow conspirator Bos'n's Mate Joe Bradford, also wearing a\n gas mask.\n\n\n Nelson spoke in a low tone, his lips close to Bradford's ear. \"It\n worked, Joe!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah!\" Bradford agreed. \"It worked\u2014fine!\"\n\n\n The limp bodies of the\nComerford's\ncrew were being carried to the\n lowered accommodation ladder and transferred into waiting lifeboats.\n\n\n Nelson swore under his breath. \"Reckon it'll take a couple of hours\n before the ship's rid of that damn gas!\"\n\n\n Bradford shook his head in disagreement. \"The old geezer claims he's\n got a neutralizing chemical in one of them tanks of his that'll clear\n everything up inside half an hour.\"\n\n\n \"I'd rather get along without Androka, if we could!\" Nelson muttered.\n \"He's nothing but a crackpot!\"\n\n\n \"It was a crackpot who invented the gas we used to break up the\n Maginot Line,\" Bradford reminded him. \"It saved a lot of lives for the\nFuehrer\n\u2014lives that'd have been lost if the forts had to be taken by\n our storm troopers!\"\n\n\n Nelson grunted and turned away. A short, thick-set figure in the\n uniform of a German naval commander had ascended the accommodation\n ladder and was mounting to the bridge. He, too, was equipped with a\n respirator.\n\n\n He came up to Nelson, saluted, and held out his hand, introducing\n himself as Herr Kommander Brandt. He began to speak in German, but\n Nelson stopped him.\n\n\n \"I don't speak any German,\" he explained. \"I was born and educated in\n the United States\u2014of German parents, who had been ruined in the First\n World War. My mother committed suicide when she learned that we were\n penniless. My father\u2014\" He paused and cleared his throat.\n\n\n \"\nJa!\nYour father?\" the German officer prompted, dropping into\n accented English. \"Your father?\"\n\n\n \"My father dedicated me to a career of revenge\u2014to wipe out his\n wrongs,\" Nelson continued. \"If America hadn't gone into the First\n World War, he wouldn't have lost his business; my mother would still\n be living. When he joined the Nazi party, the way became clear to use\n me\u2014to educate me in a military prep school, then send me to Annapolis,\n for a career in the United States navy\u2014and no one suspected me. No\n one\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sometimes,\" Bradford put in, \"I think Curtis suspected you.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe Curtis'll find out his suspicions were justified,\" Nelson said\n bitterly. \"But it won't do Curtis any good\u2014a commander who's lost\n his ship.\" He turned to Brandt. \"You have plenty of men to work the\nComerford\n?\"\n\n\n Brandt nodded his square head. \"We have a full crew\u2014two hundred\n men\u2014officers, seamen, mechanics, radio men, technical experts, all\n German naval reservists living in the United States, who've been sent\n here secretly, a few at a time, during the past six weeks!\"\nThe three\u2014Brandt, Nelson and Bradford\u2014stood on the bridge and talked,\n while the efficient stretcher-bearers worked industriously to remove\n the limp bodies of the\nComerford's\nunconscious crew and row them\n ashore.\n\n\n And when that task was completed, lifeboats began to come alongside\n with strange-looking radio equipment, and more gas tanks like those\n Androka had brought aboard the\nComerford\nwith him, and dynamos and\n batteries that looked like something out of a scientific nightmare.\n\n\n And bustling all over the place, barking excited commands in German,\n pushing and pulling and pointing to emphasize his directions, was the\n strange figure of Professor Zukor Androka!\n\n\n \"The professor's in his glory!\" Nelson remarked to Kommander Brandt.\n\n\n \"Funny thing about him,\" Bradford put in, \"is that his inventions work.\n That zone of silence cut us off completely.\"\n\n\n Kommander Brandt nodded. \"Goodt! But you got your message giving your\n bearings\u2014the wrong ones?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Nelson said. \"That came through all right. And won't Curtis have\n a time explaining it!\"\n\n\n \"Hereafter,\" Brandt said solemnly, \"the zone of silence vill be\n projected from the\nComerford\n; and ve have another invention of\n Androka's vich vill be even more useful vhen ve come to cut the\nCarethusia\nout of her convoy.\"\n\n\n \"The\nCarethusia\n?\" Nelson asked, in a puzzled tone.\n\n\n Brandt said: \"She's a freighter in a convoy out of St. Johns\u2014twelve\n thousand tons. The orders are to take her; not sink her.\"\n\n\n \"What's the idea?\"\n\n\n \"Her cargo,\" Brandt explained. \"It iss more precious than rubies. It\n includes a large shipment of boarts.\"\n\n\n \"Boarts?\" Nelson repeated. \"What are they?\"\n\n\n \"Boarts,\" Brandt told him, \"are industrial diamonds\u2014black,\n imperfectly crystallized stones, but far more valuable to us than\n flawless diamonds from Tiffany's on Fift' Avenue. They are needed for\n making machine tools. They come from northern Brazil\u2014and our supply is\n low.\"\n\n\n \"I should think we could get a shipment of these boarts direct from\n Brazil\u2014through the blockade,\" Nelson said, \"without taking the risk of\n capturing a United States navy cruiser.\"\n\n\n \"There are other things Germany needs desperately on board the\nCarethusia\n,\" Brandt explained. \"Vanadium and nickel and hundreds of\n barrels of lard oil for machine-tool lubrication. Our agents have been\n watching the convoys closely for weeks for just such a cargo as the\nCarethusia\nis taking over.\"\n\n\n \"Can we trust Androka?\" Nelson asked, with a sudden note of suspicion\n in his voice.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Brandt assured him. \"Of all men\u2014we can trust Androka!\"\n\n\n \"But he's a Czech,\" Nelson argued.\n\n\n \"The\ngestapo\ntakes care of Czechs and Poles and Frenchmen and other\n foreigners whom it chooses as its agents,\" Brandt pointed out. \"Androka\n has a daughter and other relations in Prague. He knows that if anything\n misfires, if there is the slightest suspicion of treachery on his part,\n his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka's loyalty is assured!\"\n\n\n Nelson turned to watch the forward fighting top of the\nComerford\n.\n The masked German seamen were installing some sort of apparatus\n up there\u2014a strange-looking object that looked something like an\n old-fashioned trench mortar, and which connected with cables to the\n room that served as Androka's laboratory and workshop.\n\n\n Another crew was installing radio apparatus in the mizzentop turret.\n\n\n Descending a companionway to see what was going on below, Nelson found\n that portholes were being opened, and men were spraying chemical around\n to rid the below-decks atmosphere of the lethal gas that had overcome\n the\nComerford's\nAmerican crew.\n\n\n Returning to the bridge, he found that the tide in the inlet had risen\n considerably, and that the cruiser was riding more easily at her anchor.\n\n\n Then, at Brandt's orders, the anchor was hauled in, and lifeboats and a\n motor launch were used as tugs to work the vessel entirely free of the\n sand bar. This was accomplished without difficulty.\n\n\n Brandt came over to where Nelson was standing on the bridge and held\n out his hand.\n\n\n \"Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson!\" he said. \"Ve have stolen one\n of the United States navy's newest and fastest cruisers!\" He made a\n gesture as if raising a beer stein to drink a toast. \"\nProsit!\n\" he\n added.\n\n\n \"\nProsit!\n\" Nelson repeated, and the two grinned at each other.\nStars were twinkling in a patch of black-blue sky, and broken mountains\n of gray cloud were skudding before the east wind. Commander Bob Curtis\n found himself lying in wet sand, on a beach, somewhere, with the\n rain\u2014now a light, driving mist\u2014beating on his face. He was chilled;\n his limbs were stiff and numb. His nose and throat felt parched inside,\n as if a wave of searing heat had scorched them.\n\n\n According to his last calculations, the\nComerford\nhad been cruising\n off the Maine coast. This probably was one of the islets of that\n region, or it might be the mainland.\n\n\n It was hard work getting to his feet, and when he did manage to stand,\n he could only plant his heels in the sand and sway to and fro for fully\n a minute, like a child learning to walk.\n\n\n All around him in the nearly total darkness, he could make out the dim\n forms of men sprawled on the beach; and of other men moving about,\n exploring. He heard the murmur of voices and saw the glow of lighted\n cigarettes.\n\n\n A man with a flashlight was approaching him. Its white glare shone for\n a moment in Curtis' face, and the familiar voice of Ensign Jack Dillon\n spoke: \"Commander Curtis! Are you O. K., sir?\"\n\n\n \"I think so!\" Curtis' heart warmed at the eager expression in Dillon's\n face; at the heartfelt concern in his friendly brown eyes. The young\n ensign was red-headed, impetuous, thoroughly genuine in his emotions.\n \"How about yourself, Jack?\" Curtis added.\n\n\n \"A bit of a headache from the gas, but that's all. Any orders, sir?\"\n\n\n Curtis thought for a moment. \"Muster the crew, as best you can. We'll\n try to make a roll call. Is there any sign of the ship?\"\n\n\n There was a solemn note in Dillon's voice. \"No, sir. She's been worked\n off the sandbar and put to sea!\"\n\n\n The words struck Curtis with the numbing shock of a blow on some nerve\n center. For the first time, he realized fully the tragedy that had\n swept down on him. He had lost his ship\u2014one of the United States\n navy's fastest and newest small light cruisers\u2014under circumstances\n which smelled strongly of treachery and sabotage.\n\n\n As he thought back, he realized that he\nmight\nhave prevented the\n loss, if he had been more alert, more suspicious. For it was clear to\n him now that the\nComerford\nhad been deliberately steered to this\n place; that the men who had seized her had been waiting here for that\n very purpose.\n\n\n The pieces of the picture fitted together like a jigsaw\n puzzle\u2014Androka's zone of silence; the bearings given by radio;\n Navigating Officer Nelson's queer conduct. They were all part of a\n carefully laid plan!\n\n\n All the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nelson came flooding into\n Curtis' mind. He had never liked the man; never trusted him. Nelson\n always acted as if he had some secret, something to hide.\n\n\n Curtis recalled that Nelson and Androka had long conversations\n together\u2014conversations which they would end abruptly when anyone else\n came within earshot. And Nelson had always been chummy with the worst\n trouble maker in the crew\u2014Bos'n's Mate Bradford.\n\n\n Curtis went around, finding the officers, issuing orders. There were\n still some unconscious men to be revived. In a sheltered cove among\n the rocks, an exploring group had found enough dry driftwood to make a\n fire\u2014\n\n\n In another hour, the skies had cleared, and white moonlight flooded\n the scene with a ghostly radiance. The men of the\nComerford\nhad\n all regained consciousness and were drying out in front of the big\n driftwood bonfires in the cove.\n\n\n Curtis ordered a beacon kept burning on a high promontory. Then he got\n the men lined up, according to their respective classifications, for a\n check-up on the missing.\n\n\n When this was completed, it was found that the\nComerford's\nentire\n complement of two hundred and twenty men were present\u2014except\n Navigating Officer Nelson, and Bos'n's Mate Bradford! And Zukor Androka\n was also missing!\n\n\n With the coming of dawn, a little exploration revealed that the\nComerford's\ncrew was marooned on an islet, about a square mile in\n area; that they had been put ashore without food or extra clothing or\n equipment of any kind, and that no boats had been left for them.\n\n\n One searching party reported finding the remains of what had been a\n radio station on a high promontory on the north shore of the islet.\n Another had found the remains of tents and log cabins, recently\n demolished, in a small, timbered hollow\u2014a well-hidden spot invisible\n from the air, unless one were flying very low; a place where two\n hundred or more men could have camped.\n\n\n There was a good water supply\u2014a small creek fed by springs\u2014but\n nothing in the way of food. Evidently food was a precious commodity\n which the recent inhabitants of the islet couldn't afford to leave\n behind.\n\n\n Curtis was studying the wreckage of the wireless station, wondering\n if this might have been the source of Androka's zone of silence, when\n Ensign Jack Dillon came up to him.\n\n\n \"There's a coast-guard cutter heading for the island, sir,\" he\n announced.\n",
