Alan stopped,\n puzzled. Two more blasts, quickly\n together, and the sound of a\n scream faintly.\n\n\n Frowning, worrying about the\n sounds, Alan momentarily forgot\n to watch his step until his foot\n suddenly plunged into an ant\n hill, throwing him to the jungle\n floor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again,\n for the tenth time, and stood\n uncertainly in the dimness.\n From tall, moss-shrouded trees,\n wrist-thick vines hung quietly,\n scraping the spongy ground like\n the tentacles of some monstrous\n tree-bound octopus. Fitful little\n plants grew straggly in the\n shadows of the mossy trunks,\n forming a dense underbrush that\n made walking difficult. At midday\n some few of the blue sun's\n rays filtered through to the\n jungle floor, but now, late afternoon\n on the planet, the shadows\n were long and gloomy.\n\n\n Alan peered around him at the\n vine-draped shadows, listening\n to the soft rustlings and faint\n twig-snappings of life in the\n jungle. Two short, popping\n sounds echoed across the stillness,\n drowned out almost immediately\n and silenced by an\n explosive crash. Alan started,\n \"Blaster fighting! But it can't\n be!\"\n\n\n Suddenly anxious, he slashed\n a hurried X in one of the trees\n to mark his position then turned\n to follow a line of similar marks\n back through the jungle. He\n tried to run, but vines blocked\n his way and woody shrubs\n caught at his legs, tripping him\n and holding him back. Then,\n through the trees he saw the\n clearing of the camp site, the\n temporary home for the scout\n ship and the eleven men who,\n with Alan, were the only humans\n on the jungle planet, Waiamea.\nStepping through the low\n shrubbery at the edge of the\n site, he looked across the open\n area to the two temporary structures,\n the camp headquarters\n where the power supplies and\n the computer were; and the\n sleeping quarters. Beyond, nose\n high, stood the silver scout ship\n that had brought the advance\n exploratory party of scientists\n and technicians to Waiamea\n three days before. Except for a\n few of the killer robots rolling\n slowly around the camp site on\n their quiet treads, there was no\n one about.\n\n\n \"So, they've finally got those\n things working.\" Alan smiled\n slightly. \"Guess that means I\n owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda\n for sure. Anybody who can\n build a robot that hunts by homing\n in on animals' mind impulses ...\"\n He stepped forward\n just as a roar of blue flame dissolved\n the branches of a tree,\n barely above his head.\n\n\n Without pausing to think,\n Alan leaped back, and fell\n sprawling over a bush just as\n one of the robots rolled silently\n up from the right, lowering its\n blaster barrel to aim directly at\n his head. Alan froze. \"My God,\n Pete built those things wrong!\"\n\n\n Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\n of claws and teeth hurled\n itself from the smoldering\n branches and crashed against the\n robot, clawing insanely at the\n antenna and blaster barrel.\n With an awkward jerk the robot\n swung around and fired its blaster,\n completely dissolving the\n lower half of the cat creature\n which had clung across the barrel.\n But the back pressure of the\n cat's body overloaded the discharge\n circuits. The robot started\n to shake, then clicked sharply\n as an overload relay snapped\n and shorted the blaster cells.\n The killer turned and rolled back\n towards the camp, leaving Alan\n alone.\n\n\n Shakily, Alan crawled a few\n feet back into the undergrowth\n where he could lie and watch the\n camp, but not himself be seen.\n Though visibility didn't make\n any difference to the robots, he\n felt safer, somehow, hidden. He\n knew now what the shooting\n sounds had been and why there\n hadn't been anyone around the\n camp site. A charred blob lying\n in the grass of the clearing confirmed\n his hypothesis. His stomach\n felt sick.\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\n himself, \"that Pete assembled\n these robots in a batch and then\n activated them all at once, probably\n never living to realize that\n they're tuned to pick up human\n brain waves, too. Damn!\n Damn!\" His eyes blurred and\n he slammed his fist into the soft\n earth.\n\n\n When he raised his eyes again\n the jungle was perceptibly darker.\n Stealthy rustlings in the\n shadows grew louder with the\n setting sun. Branches snapped\n unaccountably in the trees overhead\n and every now and then\n leaves or a twig fell softly to the\n ground, close to where he lay.\n Reaching into his jacket, Alan\n fingered his pocket blaster. He\n pulled it out and held it in his\n right hand. \"This pop gun\n wouldn't even singe a robot, but\n it just might stop one of those\n pumas.\"\nThey said the blast with your name on it would find\n you anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\nSlowly Alan looked around,\n sizing up his situation. Behind\n him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\n He shuddered. \"Not a\n very healthy spot to spend the\n night. On the other hand, I certainly\n can't get to the camp with\n a pack of mind-activated mechanical\n killers running around.\n If I can just hold out until morning,\n when the big ship arrives ...\n The big ship! Good\n Lord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\n oily sweat punctuated his forehead.\n Peggy, arriving tomorrow\n with the other colonists, the\n wives and kids! The metal killers,\n tuned to blast any living\n flesh, would murder them the\n instant they stepped from the\n ship!\nA pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\n he'd married just three weeks\n ago. He still couldn't believe it.\n It was crazy, he supposed, to\n marry a girl and then take off\n for an unknown planet, with her\n to follow, to try to create a home\n in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\n but Peggy and her green eyes\n that changed color with the\n light, with her soft brown hair,\n and her happy smile, had ended\n thirty years of loneliness and\n had, at last, given him a reason\n for living. \"Not to be killed!\"\n Alan unclenched his fists and\n wiped his palms, bloody where\n his fingernails had dug into the\n flesh.\n\n\n There was a slight creak above\n him like the protesting of a\n branch too heavily laden. Blaster\n ready, Alan rolled over onto his\n back. In the movement, his elbow\n struck the top of a small\n earthy mound and he was instantly\n engulfed in a swarm of\n locust-like insects that beat disgustingly\n against his eyes and\n mouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\n arms before his face he jumped\n up and backwards, away from\n the bugs. As he did so, a dark\n shapeless thing plopped from\n the trees onto the spot where he\n had been lying stretched out.\n Then, like an ambient fungus,\n it slithered off into the jungle\n undergrowth.\n\n\n For a split second the jungle\n stood frozen in a brilliant blue\n flash, followed by the sharp report\n of a blaster. Then another.\n Alan whirled, startled. The\n planet's double moon had risen\n and he could see a robot rolling\n slowly across the clearing in his\n general direction, blasting indiscriminately\n at whatever mind\n impulses came within its pickup\n range, birds, insects, anything.\n Six or seven others also left the\n camp headquarters area and\n headed for the jungle, each to a\n slightly different spot.\n\n\n Apparently the robot hadn't\n sensed him yet, but Alan didn't\n know what the effective range\n of its pickup devices was. He\n began to slide back into the\n jungle. Minutes later, looking\n back he saw that the machine,\n though several hundred yards\n away, had altered its course and\n was now headed directly for\n him.\n\n\n His stomach tightened. Panic.\n The dank, musty smell of the\n jungle seemed for an instant to\n thicken and choke in his throat.\n Then he thought of the big ship\n landing in the morning, settling\n down slowly after a lonely two-week\n voyage. He thought of a\n brown-haired girl crowding with\n the others to the gangway, eager\n to embrace the new planet, and\n the next instant a charred nothing,\n unrecognizable, the victim\n of a design error or a misplaced\n wire in a machine. \"I have to\n try,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\n try.\" He moved into the blackness.\n\n\n Powerful as a small tank, the\n killer robot was equipped to\n crush, slash, and burn its way\n through undergrowth. Nevertheless,\n it was slowed by the\n larger trees and the thick, clinging\n vines, and Alan found that\n he could manage to keep ahead\n of it, barely out of blaster range.\n Only, the robot didn't get tired.\n Alan did.\n\n\n The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\n shadows that wavered\n and danced across the jungle\n floor, hiding debris that tripped\n him and often sent him sprawling\n into the dark. Sharp-edged\n growths tore at his face and\n clothes, and insects attracted by\n the blood matted against his\n pants and shirt. Behind, the robot\n crashed imperturbably after\n him, lighting the night with fitful\n blaster flashes as some\n winged or legged life came within\n its range.\n\n\n There was movement also, in\n the darkness beside him, scrapings\n and rustlings and an occasional\n low, throaty sound like an\n angry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\n on his pocket blaster. Swift\n shadowy forms moved quickly in\n the shrubs and the growling became\n suddenly louder. He fired\n twice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\n Sharp screams punctuated\n the electric blue discharge as\n a pack of small feline creatures\n leaped snarling and clawing\n back into the night.\nMentally, Alan tried to figure\n the charge remaining in his blaster.\n There wouldn't be much.\n \"Enough for a few more shots,\n maybe. Why the devil didn't I\n load in fresh cells this morning!\"\n\n\n The robot crashed on, louder\n now, gaining on the tired human.\n Legs aching and bruised,\n stinging from insect bites, Alan\n tried to force himself to run\n holding his hands in front of\n him like a child in the dark. His\n foot tripped on a barely visible\n insect hill and a winged swarm\n exploded around him. Startled,\n Alan jerked sideways, crashing\n his head against a tree. He\n clutched at the bark for a second,\n dazed, then his knees\n buckled. His blaster fell into the\n shadows.\n\n\n The robot crashed loudly behind\n him now. Without stopping\n to think, Alan fumbled along the\n ground after his gun, straining\n his eyes in the darkness. He\n found it just a couple of feet to\n one side, against the base of a\n small bush. Just as his fingers\n closed upon the barrel his other\n hand slipped into something\n sticky that splashed over his\n forearm. He screamed in pain\n and leaped back, trying frantically\n to wipe the clinging,\n burning blackness off his arm.\n Patches of black scraped off onto\n branches and vines, but the rest\n spread slowly over his arm as\n agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\n being ripped away layer by\n layer.\n\n\n Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\n Alan stumbled forward.\n Sharp muscle spasms shot from\n his shoulder across his back and\n chest. Tears streamed across his\n cheeks.\n\n\n A blue arc slashed at the trees\n a mere hundred yards behind.\n He screamed at the blast. \"Damn\n you, Pete! Damn your robots!\n Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\n He stepped into emptiness.\n\n\n Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\n by the water, the pain began to\n fall away. He wanted to lie there\n forever in the dark, cool, wetness.\n For ever, and ever, and ...\n The air thundered.\n\n\n In the dim light he could see\n the banks of the stream, higher\n than a man, muddy and loose.\n Growing right to the edge of the\n banks, the jungle reached out\n with hairy, disjointed arms as\n if to snag even the dirty little\n stream that passed so timidly\n through its domain.\n\n\n Alan, lying in the mud of the\n stream bed, felt the earth shake\n as the heavy little robot rolled\n slowly and inexorably towards\n him. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\n he thought, \"in battle\n dress.\" He tried to stand but his\n legs were almost too weak and\n his arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\n him,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\n the Lord High Executioner.\" He\n laughed. Then his mind cleared.\n He remembered where he was.\nAlan trembled. For the first\n time in his life he understood\n what it was to live, because for\n the first time he realized that he\n would sometime die. In other\n times and circumstances he\n might put it off for a while, for\n months or years, but eventually,\n as now, he would have to watch,\n still and helpless, while death\n came creeping. Then, at thirty,\n Alan became a man.\n\n\n \"Dammit, no law says I have\n to flame-out\nnow\n!\" He forced\n himself to rise, forced his legs\n to stand, struggling painfully in\n the shin-deep ooze. He worked\n his way to the bank and began to\n dig frenziedly, chest high, about\n two feet below the edge.\n\n\n His arm where the black thing\n had been was swollen and tender,\n but he forced his hands to dig,\n dig, dig, cursing and crying to\n hide the pain, and biting his\n lips, ignoring the salty taste of\n blood. The soft earth crumbled\n under his hands until he had a\n small cave about three feet deep\n in the bank. Beyond that the\n soil was held too tightly by the\n roots from above and he had to\n stop.\nThe air crackled blue and a\n tree crashed heavily past Alan\n into the stream. Above him on\n the bank, silhouetting against\n the moons, the killer robot stopped\n and its blaster swivelled\n slowly down. Frantically, Alan\n hugged the bank as a shaft of\n pure electricity arced over him,\n sliced into the water, and exploded\n in a cloud of steam. The\n robot shook for a second, its\n blaster muzzle lifted erratically\n and for an instant it seemed almost\n out of control, then it\n quieted and the muzzle again\n pointed down.\n\n\n Pressing with all his might,\n Alan slid slowly along the bank\n inches at a time, away from the\n machine above. Its muzzle turned\n to follow him but the edge of\n the bank blocked its aim. Grinding\n forward a couple of feet,\n slightly overhanging the bank,\n the robot fired again. For a split\n second Alan seemed engulfed in\n flame; the heat of hell singed his\n head and back, and mud boiled\n in the bank by his arm.\n\n\n Again the robot trembled. It\n jerked forward a foot and its\n blaster swung slightly away. But\n only for a moment. Then the gun\n swung back again.\n\n\n Suddenly, as if sensing something\n wrong, its tracks slammed\n into reverse. It stood poised for\n a second, its treads spinning\n crazily as the earth collapsed underneath\n it, where Alan had\n dug, then it fell with a heavy\n splash into the mud, ten feet\n from where Alan stood.\n\n\n Without hesitation Alan\n threw himself across the blaster\n housing, frantically locking his\n arms around the barrel as the\n robot's treads churned furiously\n in the sticky mud, causing it to\n buck and plunge like a Brahma\n bull. The treads stopped and the\n blaster jerked upwards wrenching\n Alan's arms, then slammed\n down. Then the whole housing\n whirled around and around, tilting\n alternately up and down like\n a steel-skinned water monster\n trying to dislodge a tenacious\n crab, while Alan, arms and legs\n wrapped tightly around the blaster\n barrel and housing, pressed\n fiercely against the robot's metal\n skin.\n\n\n Slowly, trying to anticipate\n and shift his weight with the\n spinning plunges, Alan worked\n his hand down to his right hip.\n He fumbled for the sheath clipped\n to his belt, found it, and extracted\n a stubby hunting knife.\n Sweat and blood in his eyes,\n hardly able to move on the wildly\n swinging turret, he felt down\n the sides to the thin crack between\n the revolving housing and\n the stationary portion of the robot.\n With a quick prayer he\n jammed in the knife blade\u2014and\n was whipped headlong into the\n mud as the turret literally snapped\n to a stop.\n\n\n The earth, jungle and moons\n spun in a pinwheeled blur,\n slowed, and settled to their proper\n places. Standing in the sticky,\n sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\n the robot apprehensively. Half\n buried in mud, it stood quiet in\n the shadowy light except for an\n occasional, almost spasmodic\n jerk of its blaster barrel. For\n the first time that night Alan\n allowed himself a slight smile.\n \"A blade in the old gear box,\n eh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n\n\n He turned. \"Well, I'd better\n get out of here before the knife\n slips or the monster cooks up\n some more tricks with whatever\n it's got for a brain.\" Digging\n little footholds in the soft bank,\n he climbed up and stood once\n again in the rustling jungle\n darkness.\n\n\n \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\n Pete could cram enough brain\n into one of those things to make\n it hunt and track so perfectly.\"\n He tried to visualize the computing\n circuits needed for the\n operation of its tracking mechanism\n alone. \"There just isn't\n room for the electronics. You'd\n need a computer as big as the\n one at camp headquarters.\"\nIn the distance the sky blazed\n as a blaster roared in the jungle.\n Then Alan heard the approaching\n robot, crunching and snapping\n its way through the undergrowth\n like an onrushing forest\n fire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\n They communicate with each\n other! The one I jammed must\n be calling others to help.\"\n\n\n He began to move along the\n bank, away from the crashing\n sounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\n eyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\n I'll bet anything they're\n automatically controlled by the\n camp computer. That's where\n their brain is!\" He paused.\n \"Then, if that were put out of\n commission ...\" He jerked away\n from the bank and half ran, half\n pulled himself through the undergrowth\n towards the camp.\n\n\n Trees exploded to his left as\n another robot fired in his direction,\n too far away to be effective\n but churning towards him\n through the blackness.\n\n\n Alan changed direction slightly\n to follow a line between the\n two robots coming up from\n either side, behind him. His eyes\n were well accustomed to the dark\n now, and he managed to dodge\n most of the shadowy vines and\n branches before they could snag\n or trip him. Even so, he stumbled\n in the wiry underbrush and\n his legs were a mass of stinging\n slashes from ankle to thigh.\n\n\n The crashing rumble of the\n killer robots shook the night behind\n him, nearer sometimes,\n then falling slightly back, but\n following constantly, more\n unshakable than bloodhounds\n because a man can sometimes cover\n a scent, but no man can stop his\n thoughts. Intermittently, like\n photographers' strobes, blue\n flashes would light the jungle\n about him. Then, for seconds\n afterwards his eyes would see\n dancing streaks of yellow and\n sharp multi-colored pinwheels\n that alternately shrunk and expanded\n as if in a surrealist's\n nightmare. Alan would have to\n pause and squeeze his eyelids\n tight shut before he could see\n again, and the robots would\n move a little closer.\n\n\n To his right the trees silhouetted\n briefly against brilliance as\n a third robot slowly moved up\n in the distance. Without thinking,\n Alan turned slightly to the\n left, then froze in momentary\n panic. \"I should be at the camp\n now. Damn, what direction am\n I going?\" He tried to think\n back, to visualize the twists and\n turns he'd taken in the jungle.\n \"All I need is to get lost.\"\n\n\n He pictured the camp computer\n with no one to stop it, automatically\n sending its robots in\n wider and wider forays, slowly\n wiping every trace of life from\n the planet. Technologically advanced\n machines doing the job\n for which they were built, completely,\n thoroughly, without feeling,\n and without human masters\n to separate sense from futility.\n Finally parts would wear out,\n circuits would short, and one by\n one the killers would crunch to\n a halt. A few birds would still\n fly then, but a unique animal\n life, rare in the universe, would\n exist no more. And the bones of\n children, eager girls, and their\n men would also lie, beside a\n rusty hulk, beneath the alien\n sun.\n\n\n \"Peggy!\"\n\n\n As if in answer, a tree beside\n him breathed fire, then exploded.\n In the brief flash of the\n blaster shot, Alan saw the steel\n glint of a robot only a hundred\n yards away, much nearer than\n he had thought. \"Thank heaven\n for trees!\" He stepped back, felt\n his foot catch in something,\n clutched futilely at some leaves\n and fell heavily.\n\n\n Pain danced up his leg as he\n grabbed his ankle. Quickly he\n felt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\n the rotten luck, anyway!\" He\n blinked the pain tears from his\n eyes and looked up\u2014into a robot's\n blaster, jutting out of the\n foliage, thirty yards away.\nInstinctively, in one motion\n Alan grabbed his pocket blaster\n and fired. To his amazement the\n robot jerked back, its gun wobbled\n and started to tilt away.\n Then, getting itself under control,\n it swung back again to face\n Alan. He fired again, and again\n the robot reacted. It seemed familiar\n somehow. Then he remembered\n the robot on the river\n bank, jiggling and swaying for\n seconds after each shot. \"Of\n course!\" He cursed himself for\n missing the obvious. \"The blaster\n static blanks out radio\n transmission from the computer\n for a few seconds. They even do\n it to themselves!\"\n\n\n Firing intermittently, he\n pulled himself upright and hobbled\n ahead through the bush.\n The robot shook spasmodically\n with each shot, its gun tilted upward\n at an awkward angle.\n\n\n Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\n stars, real stars brilliant in the\n night sky, and half dragging his\n swelling leg he stumbled out of\n the jungle into the camp clearing.\n Ahead, across fifty yards of\n grass stood the headquarters\n building, housing the robot-controlling\n computer. Still firing at\n short intervals he started across\n the clearing, gritting his teeth\n at every step.\n\n\n Straining every muscle in\n spite of the agonizing pain, Alan\n forced himself to a limping run\n across the uneven ground, carefully\n avoiding the insect hills\n that jutted up through the grass.\n From the corner of his eye he\n saw another of the robots standing\n shakily in the dark edge of\n the jungle waiting, it seemed,\n for his small blaster to run dry.\n\n\n \"Be damned! You can't win\n now!\" Alan yelled between blaster\n shots, almost irrational from\n the pain that ripped jaggedly\n through his leg. Then it happened.\n A few feet from the\n building's door his blaster quit.\n A click. A faint hiss when he\n frantically jerked the trigger\n again and again, and the spent\n cells released themselves from\n the device, falling in the grass\n at his feet. He dropped the useless\n gun.\n\n\n \"No!\" He threw himself on\n the ground as a new robot suddenly\n appeared around the edge\n of the building a few feet away,\n aimed, and fired. Air burned\n over Alan's back and ozone tingled\n in his nostrils.\n\n\n Blinding itself for a few seconds\n with its own blaster static,\n the robot paused momentarily,\n jiggling in place. In this\n instant, Alan jammed his hands\n into an insect hill and hurled the\n pile of dirt and insects directly\n at the robot's antenna. In a flash,\n hundreds of the winged things\n erupted angrily from the hole in\n a swarming cloud, each part of\n which was a speck of life\n transmitting mental energy to the\n robot's pickup devices.\n\n\n Confused by the sudden dispersion\n of mind impulses, the\n robot fired erratically as Alan\n crouched and raced painfully for\n the door. It fired again, closer,\n as he fumbled with the lock\n release. Jagged bits of plastic and\n stone ripped past him, torn loose\n by the blast.\n\n\n Frantically, Alan slammed\n open the door as the robot, sensing\n him strongly now, aimed\n point blank. He saw nothing, his\n mind thought of nothing but the\n red-clad safety switch mounted\n beside the computer. Time stopped.\n There was nothing else in\n the world. He half-jumped, half-fell\n towards it, slowly, in tenths\n of seconds that seemed measured\n out in years.\n\n\n The universe went black.\n\n\n Later. Brilliance pressed upon\n his eyes. Then pain returned, a\n multi-hurting thing that crawled\n through his body and dragged\n ragged tentacles across his\n brain. He moaned.\n\n\n A voice spoke hollowly in the\n distance. \"He's waking. Call his\n wife.\"\n\n\n Alan opened his eyes in a\n white room; a white light hung\n over his head. Beside him, looking\n down with a rueful smile,\n stood a young man wearing\n space medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\n he acknowledged the question in\n Alan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\n That was three days ago. When\n you're up again we'd all like to\n thank you.\"\n\n\n Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\n green-eyed girl was pressed\n tightly against him. Neither of\n them spoke. They couldn't. There\n was too much to say.\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAmazing Science Fiction Stories\nOctober 1958.
