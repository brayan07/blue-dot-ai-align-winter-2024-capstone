  "article": "Brightside\n\n Crossing\nby Alan E. Nourse\nJAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\n a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\n had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\n were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\n had flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousand\n pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave no\n name. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back by\n eight.\u201d\nNow Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\n about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\n Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\n number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\n vaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\n near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\n the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\n returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\n waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\n without justifying it.\nPresently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\n down at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\n no key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014but\n he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\n forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\n healing.\nThe stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re\n planning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d\nBaron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can read\n telecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are going\n to make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d\n\u201cAt perihelion?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. When else?\u201d\nThe grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a moment\n without expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re\n not going to make the Crossing.\u201d\n\u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.\n\u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.\nThere was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?\nPeter\nClaney?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nBaron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger\n gone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014\nwhere have you been hiding?\nWe\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d\n\u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck the\n whole idea.\u201d\n\u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMy\n friend, we\u2019d given up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking.\n Here, have a drink. There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d His\n fingers were trembling.\nPeter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything you\n want to hear.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve\ngot\nto. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019s\n attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the\n story you cleared for the news\u2014it was nothing. We need\ndetails\n. Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\n miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d Baron jabbed a\n finger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?\n Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019ve\n got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make\n it across where your attempt failed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.\n\u201cOf course we want to know. We\nhave\nto know.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019t\n do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross\n the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d\nClaney shrugged. \u201cI was there. I know what I\u2019m saying. You\n can blame the equipment or the men\u2014there were flaws in\n both quarters\u2014but we just didn\u2019t know what we were fighting.\n It was the\nplanet\nthat whipped us, that and the\nSun\n. They\u2019ll\n whip you, too, if you try it.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.\n\u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.\nI\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\n I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\n Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\n I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\n I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\nI know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\n proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\n conditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\n a hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\n terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\n Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\n blood, sure as death.\nBut it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\n know Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\n He was a major in the Interplanetary Service\n for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\n his commission.\nHe was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\n did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\n the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\n years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\n since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\n Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\nI\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\n the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\n ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\n place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\n with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\n of personality that could take a crew of wild men and\n make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\n miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\nHe contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\n first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\n old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\n been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\n and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\n year\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\n Venus and what my plans were.\n\u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\nI told him one-thirty-five.\n\u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\n you, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n\u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean\nreal\nheat.\u201d\nThen I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\n dangerous, too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n\u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\nI whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\nHe threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\n What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\n heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\n drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\n days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\n about it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\n a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\n a man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\nnobody\u2019s\ngot\n Mercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\nI\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\n it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\n turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\n the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\n That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\n place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\n surface of the Sun itself.\nIt would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\n just\nhow\nhellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\n was a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\n would cross it.\nI wanted to be along.\nThe Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\n obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\n rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\n crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\n the Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\n before.\nTwilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\n of course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\n Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\n hold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\n Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\n and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\n installation with a human crew could survive at either\n extreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\n Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\n temperatures.\nSanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\n is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n 60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\n much change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\n for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\n to wheel around.\nThe Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\n about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\n to make final preparations.\nSanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\n so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\n briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\n arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\n Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\n had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\n was like.\nStone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\n he\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\n this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\n exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\n him around like a puppy.\nIt didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\n in for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\n liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\n ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\n borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\n equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\n and test.\nWe dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\n some government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\n equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\n and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\n We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\n with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\n and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\nThe Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\n said, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\n for climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\n probably heard of him.\u201d\nI\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\n too happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\n isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\n line? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\nThe Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\n McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\n trip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\n do any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n \u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\n to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\n we should leave in three days.\u201d\nTwo days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\n say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\n spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\n they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\n far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\n showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\n that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\n of our course.\n\u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\n the board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\n these to the south and west\ncould\nbe active. Seismograph\n tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\n down toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\n shifting.\u201d\nStone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\n surface activity.\u201d\nThe Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\n doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\n Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\n less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\n find a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\nIt seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\n further we got from a solution. We knew there were active\n volcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\n surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\n localized.\nBut there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\n well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\n flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\n had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\n millennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n 2\n , and nitrogen, and traces of\n other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\n vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\nThe atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\n condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\n to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\n Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\n that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\n analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\n we would find out what was happening where was to be there.\nFinally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\n rocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\n I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\n in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\n about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\n he couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\nHe was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\n gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\n sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\n And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\n something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\nEvidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\n arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\n running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\n Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\n set for an early departure after we got some rest.\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling\n the waiter for another pair, \u201cwas your first big mistake.\u201d\nPeter Claney raised his eyebrows. \u201cMcIvers?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nClaney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around\n them. \u201cThere are lots of bizarre personalities around a place\n like this, and some of the best wouldn\u2019t seem to be the most\n reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren\u2019t\n our big problem right then.\nEquipment\nworried us first and\nroute\nnext.\u201d\nBaron nodded in agreement. \u201cWhat kind of suits did you\n have?\u201d\n\u201cThe best insulating suits ever made,\u201d said Claney. \u201cEach\n one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid\n the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit\n and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every\n eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting\n surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And\n we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between\n the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course\u2014at\n 770 degrees, it wouldn\u2019t take much time to fry us to cinders\n if the suits failed somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cHow about the Bugs?\u201d\n\u201cThey were insulated, too, but we weren\u2019t counting on\n them too much for protection.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t!\u201d Baron exclaimed. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility\n and storage, but we knew we\u2019d have to do a lot of\n forward work on foot.\u201d Claney smiled bitterly. \u201cWhich meant\n that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air\n between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like\n water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of\n sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.\u201d\nBaron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass\n as he set it down on the tablecloth.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he said tautly. \u201cYou started on schedule?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Claney, \u201cwe started on schedule, all right.\n We just didn\u2019t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I\u2019m\n getting to that.\u201d\nHe settled back in his chair and continued.\nWe jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\n with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\n could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\n Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closest\n approach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part of\n the planet at the hottest it ever gets.\nThe Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\n when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\n that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\n surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\n was only half done\u2014we would still have to travel another\n two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\n was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,\n approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\nThat was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\n seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\n what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\n time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\n that.\nThe Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n \u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\n down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\n you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job of\n dragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course pretty\n closely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\n If there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore ahead\n on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\nMcIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack\n and I were planning to change around. We figured he could\n take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d\nThe Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,\n Jack?\u201d\nStone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\nMcIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt\n doesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does\n it make any difference?\u201d\n\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank\n Peter along with me. Right?\u201d\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going\n to do the advance scouting?\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead\n Bug light as possible.\u201d\nMikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down\n to the frame and wheels.\u201d\nMcIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the\nadvance\nwork.\n You need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to\n pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n He stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort of\n a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\n ahead?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said\n sharply.\n\u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about\ndetail\nwork. We don\u2019t need to\n worry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you\n can\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts\n down excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\n reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\n I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\n area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\n Then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n\u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When\n we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\n means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\n climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\n alone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\nMcIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\n gave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.\n We\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\n Got that?\u201d\nMcIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\n we nodded, too.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,\n let\u2019s go.\u201d\nIt was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll\n never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\n break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\n first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\n fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\n the Twilight Lab.\nI moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\n Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\n taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\n Stone dragged the sledges.\nEven at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\n the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\n ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\n the first twenty miles.\nI kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\n the track the early research teams had made out into the edge\n of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s\n little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\n were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\n bite.\nWe didn\u2019t\nfeel\nthe heat so much those first days out. We\nsaw\nit. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\n degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\n that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\n some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\n sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\nWe drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\n came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\n a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\n The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\n degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\n forward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,\n bulk gelatin, vitamins.\nThe Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\n we\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\n We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\n and psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interesting\n reasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\n happened to be so.\nWe didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\n eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\n but we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around looking\n at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\n taste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothers\n for one ice-cold bottle of beer.\nAfter a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\n the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\n Earth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\n Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\n with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\n with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\n gases.\nIt was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\n the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\n had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\n tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\n so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\n the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\n could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\nYet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\n before, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold before\n and won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The only\n worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\n itself.\nBrightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\n get us. That was the bargain.\nI learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\n The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\n onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\n east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\n on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\n cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\n sides were shrouded with heavy ash.\nWe couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\n sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\n face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\n rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\n rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\n from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\n dust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\n ash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacherous\n surface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\nI learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\n sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\n from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\n a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\n light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\n until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\n was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\n at first.\nToo smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\n think so, too.\nMcIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\n He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\n driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\n with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\n now and then, never far, but a little further each time.\nJack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\n each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but\n I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\n enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\nAnd every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\n the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\n filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\n constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\n end of an eight-hour trek.\nBut it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\n penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\n down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\n route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\n heard a sharp cry through our earphones.\nI wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\n spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\n top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\n the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\n horrible pictures racing through our minds....\nWe found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\n and, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreck\n of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\n hadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\n the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\n middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\n two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\n fiberglass helmets.\nThis was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\ntheir\nBrightside Crossing.\nOn the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.\n It looked the same, but every now and then it\nfelt\ndifferent.\n On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest\n from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;\n I gunned my motor and nothing happened.\nI could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,\n thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as\n the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the\n wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the\n tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for\n all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten\n lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\nI picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into\n an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.\n I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed\n McIvers\u2019 scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for\n the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn\u2019t\n like it.\nOne error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn\u2019t thinking\n much about the others. I was worried about\nme\n, plenty\n worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.\n It wasn\u2019t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t get the\n thought out of my mind.\nIt was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in\n the Bug again, we moved still more slowly\u2014edging out on a\n broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks\u2014winding\n back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on\n solid rock. I couldn\u2019t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze\n rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw\n a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond\n a deep crack.\nI let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug\n forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved\n fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\nThere was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;\n a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across\n a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could\n feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the\n ledge shift over a few feet.\n",
