  "article": "UNBORN\n\n TOMORROW\nBY MACK REYNOLDS\nUnfortunately\n, there was only\n one thing he could bring back\n from the wonderful future ...\n and though he didn't want to\n ... nevertheless he did....\nIllustrated by Freas\n\n\n Betty\n looked up from\n her magazine. She said\n mildly, \"You're late.\"\n\n\n \"Don't yell at me, I\n feel awful,\" Simon told\n her. He sat down at his desk, passed\n his tongue over his teeth in distaste,\n groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the\n aspirin bottle.\n\n\n He looked over at Betty and said,\n almost as though reciting, \"What I\n need is a vacation.\"\n\n\n \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going\n to use for money?\"\n\n\n \"Providence,\" Simon told her\n whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,\n \"will provide.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. But before providing\n vacations it'd be nice if Providence\n turned up a missing jewel deal, say.\n Something where you could deduce\n that actually the ruby ring had gone\n down the drain and was caught in the\n elbow. Something that would net\n about fifty dollars.\"\n\n\n Simon said, mournful of tone,\n \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five\n hundred?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All\n I want is enough to pay me this\n week's salary.\"\n\n\n \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you\n took this job you said it was the romance\n that appealed to you.\"\n\n\n \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most\n sleuthing amounted to snooping\n around department stores to check on\n the clerks knocking down.\"\n\n\n Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now\n it comes.\"\nThere was a knock.\n\n\n Betty bounced up with Olympic\n agility and had the door swinging\n wide before the knocking was quite\n completed.\n\n\n He was old, little and had bug\n eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His\n suit was cut in the style of yesteryear\n but when a suit costs two or\n three hundred dollars you still retain\n caste whatever the styling.\n\n\n Simon said unenthusiastically,\n \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\n the client's chair. \"Sit down,\n sir.\"\n\n\n The client fussed himself with\n Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed\n Simon, said finally, \"You know\n my name, that's pretty good. Never\n saw you before in my life. Stop fussing\n with me, young lady. Your ad\n in the phone book says you'll investigate\n anything.\"\n\n\n \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\n one exception.\"\n\n\n \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\n travel?\"\n\n\n Simon said nothing. Across the\n room, where she had resumed her\n seat, Betty cleared her throat. When\n Simon continued to say nothing she\n ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, why?\"\n\n\n Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\n None was forthcoming. There\n ought to be some very quick, positive,\n definite answer. She said, \"Well,\n for one thing, paradox. Suppose you\n had a time machine and traveled back\n a hundred years or so and killed your\n own great-grandfather. Then how\n could you ever be born?\"\n\n\n \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\n fellow growled. \"How?\"\n\n\n Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,\n what you wanted to see me about.\"\n\n\n \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\n some time travelers,\" the old boy\n said.\n\n\n Betty was too far in now to maintain\n her proper role of silent secretary.\n \"Time travelers,\" she said, not\n very intelligently.\n\n\n The potential client sat more erect,\n obviously with intent to hold the\n floor for a time. He removed the\n pince-nez glasses and pointed them\n at Betty. He said, \"Have you read\n much science fiction, Miss?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n\n\n \"Then you'll realize that there are\n a dozen explanations of the paradoxes\n of time travel. Every writer in\n the field worth his salt has explained\n them away. But to get on. It's my\n contention that within a century or\n so man will have solved the problems\n of immortality and eternal youth, and\n it's also my suspicion that he will\n eventually be able to travel in time.\n So convinced am I of these possibilities\n that I am willing to gamble a\n portion of my fortune to investigate\n the presence in our era of such time\n travelers.\"\n\n\n Simon seemed incapable of carrying\n the ball this morning, so Betty\n said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the\n future has developed time travel why\n don't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n\n\n Simon put in a word. \"The usual\n explanation, Betty, is that they can't\n afford to allow the space-time continuum\n track to be altered. If, say, a\n time traveler returned to a period of\n twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\n then all subsequent history would be\n changed. In that case, the time traveler\n himself might never be born. They\n have to tread mighty carefully.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't\n expect you to be so well informed\n on the subject, young man.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged and fumbled\n again with the aspirin bottle.\nMr. Oyster went on. \"I've been\n considering the matter for some time\n and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon held up a hand. \"There's\n no use prolonging this. As I understand\n it, you're an elderly gentleman\n with a considerable fortune and you\n realize that thus far nobody has succeeded\n in taking it with him.\"\n\n\n Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to\n their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then\n nodded.\n\n\n Simon said, \"You want to hire me\n to find a time traveler and in some\n manner or other\u2014any manner will\n do\u2014exhort from him the secret of\n eternal life and youth, which you figure\n the future will have discovered.\n You're willing to pony up a part of\n this fortune of yours, if I can deliver\n a bona fide time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\"\n\n\n Betty had been looking from one\n to the other. Now she said, plaintively,\n \"But where are you going to find\n one of these characters\u2014especially if\n they're interested in keeping hid?\"\n\n\n The old boy was the center again.\n \"I told you I'd been considering it\n for some time. The\nOktoberfest\n,\n that's where they'd be!\" He seemed\n elated.\n\n\n Betty and Simon waited.\n\n\n \"The\nOktoberfest\n,\" he repeated.\n \"The greatest festival the world has\n ever seen, the carnival,\nferia\n,\nfiesta\nto beat them all. Every year it's held\n in Munich. Makes the New Orleans\n Mardi gras look like a quilting\n party.\" He began to swing into the\n spirit of his description. \"It originally\n started in celebration of the wedding\n of some local prince a century\n and a half ago and the Bavarians had\n such a bang-up time they've been\n holding it every year since. The\n Munich breweries do up a special\n beer,\nMarzenbr\u00e4u\nthey call it, and\n each brewery opens a tremendous tent\n on the fair grounds which will hold\n five thousand customers apiece. Millions\n of liters of beer are put away,\n hundreds of thousands of barbecued\n chickens, a small herd of oxen are\n roasted whole over spits, millions of\n pair of\nweisswurst\n, a very special\n sausage, millions upon millions of\n pretzels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept\n it. The\nOktoberfest\nis one whale\n of a wingding.\"\n\"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into\n his subject now, \"that's where they'd\n be, places like the\nOktoberfest\n. For\n one thing, a time traveler wouldn't\n be conspicuous. At a festival like this\n somebody with a strange accent, or\n who didn't know exactly how to wear\n his clothes correctly, or was off the\n ordinary in any of a dozen other\n ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could\n be a four-armed space traveler from\n Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous\n at the\nOktoberfest\n. People\n would figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n\n\n \"But why would a time traveler\n want to go to a\u2014\" Betty began.\n\n\n \"Why not! What better opportunity\n to study a people than when they\n are in their cups? If\nyou\ncould go\n back a few thousand years, the things\n you would wish to see would be a\n Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites\n of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's\n orgies. You wouldn't want to wander\n up and down the streets of, say,\n Athens while nothing was going on,\n particularly when you might be revealed\n as a suspicious character not\n being able to speak the language, not\n knowing how to wear the clothes and\n not familiar with the city's layout.\"\n He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,\n you'd have to stick to some great\n event, both for the sake of actual\n interest and for protection against being\n unmasked.\"\n\n\n The old boy wound it up. \"Well,\n that's the story. What are your rates?\n The\nOktoberfest\nstarts on Friday and\n continues for sixteen days. You can\n take the plane to Munich, spend a\n week there and\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon was shaking his head. \"Not\n interested.\"\n\n\n As soon as Betty had got her jaw\n back into place, she glared unbelievingly\n at him.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\n \"See here, young man, I realize\n this isn't an ordinary assignment,\n however, as I said, I am willing to\n risk a considerable portion of my\n fortune\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be\n done.\"\n\n\n \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"\n Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\n like the fact that you already seem\n to have some interest and knowledge\n of the matter. I liked the way you\n knew my name when I walked in the\n door; my picture doesn't appear often\n in the papers.\"\n\n\n \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\n in his voice.\n\n\n \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\n you bring me a time traveler.\"\n\n\n \"Out of the question,\" Simon\n said.\n\n\n \"But\nwhy\n?\" Betty wailed.\n\n\n \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\n two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\n you a funny story. It goes like\n this:\"\nI got a thousand dollars from Mr.\n Oyster (Simon began) in the way\n of an advance, and leaving him with\n Betty who was making out a receipt,\n I hustled back to the apartment and\n packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\n anyway, this was a natural. On\n the way to Idlewild I stopped off at\n the Germany Information Offices for\n some tourist literature.\n\n\n It takes roughly three and a half\n hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\n I spent the time planning the\n fun I was going to have.\n\n\n It takes roughly seven and a half\n hours from Gander to Shannon and\n I spent that time dreaming up material\n I could put into my reports to\n Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to\n give him some kind of report for his\n money. Time travel yet! What a\n laugh!\n\n\n Between Shannon and Munich a\n faint suspicion began to simmer in\n my mind. These statistics I read on\n the\nOktoberfest\nin the Munich tourist\n pamphlets. Five million people\n attended annually.\n\n\n Where did five million people\n come from to attend an overgrown\n festival in comparatively remote\n Southern Germany? The tourist season\n is over before September 21st,\n first day of the gigantic beer bust.\n Nor could the Germans account for\n any such number. Munich itself has\n a population of less than a million,\n counting children.\n\n\n And those millions of gallons of\n beer, the hundreds of thousands of\n chickens, the herds of oxen. Who\n ponied up all the money for such expenditures?\n How could the average\n German, with his twenty-five dollars\n a week salary?\n\n\n In Munich there was no hotel\n space available. I went to the Bahnhof\n where they have a hotel service\n and applied. They put my name\n down, pocketed the husky bribe,\n showed me where I could check my\n bag, told me they'd do what they\n could, and to report back in a few\n hours.\n\n\n I had another suspicious twinge.\n If five million people attended this\n beer bout, how were they accommodated?\n\n\n The\nTheresienwiese\n, the fair\n ground, was only a few blocks\n away. I was stiff from the plane ride\n so I walked.\nThere are seven major brewers in\n the Munich area, each of them represented\n by one of the circuslike tents\n that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent\n contained benches and tables for\n about five thousand persons and from\n six to ten thousands pack themselves\n in, competing for room. In the center\n is a tremendous bandstand, the\n musicians all\nlederhosen\nclad, the\n music as Bavarian as any to be found\n in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of\n peasant garbed\nfr\u00e4uleins\ndarted about\n the tables with quart sized earthenware\n mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,\n kraut and pretzels.\n\n\n I found a place finally at a table\n which had space for twenty-odd beer\n bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an\n assortment of Germans and foreign\n tourists as could have been dreamed\n up, ranging from a seventy- or\n eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian\n costume, to the bald-headed drunk\n across the table from me.\n\n\n A desperate waitress bearing six\n mugs of beer in each hand scurried\n past. They call them\nmasses\n, by the\n way, not mugs. The bald-headed\n character and I both held up a finger\n and she slid two of the\nmasses\nover\n to us and then hustled on.\n\n\n \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,\n holding up his\nmass\nin toast.\n\n\n \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before\n sipping, I said, \"You know, the\n tourist pamphlets say this stuff is\n eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.\n No beer is that strong.\" I took a long\n pull.\n\n\n He looked at me, waiting.\n\n\n I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.\n\n\n A\nmass\nor two apiece later he looked\n carefully at the name engraved on\n his earthenware mug. \"L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u,\"\n he said. He took a small notebook\n from his pocket and a pencil, noted\n down the word and returned the\n things.\n\n\n \"That's a queer looking pencil you\n have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"\n\n\n \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry.\n Shouldn't have said that.\"\n\n\n I had never heard of the brand so\n I skipped it.\n\n\n \"Next is the Hofbr\u00e4u,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation\n didn't seem to hang together very\n well.\n\n\n \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All\n my life I've been wanting to go back\n to an\nOktoberfest\nand sample every\n one of the seven brands of the best\n beer the world has ever known. I'm\n only as far as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u. I'm afraid\n I'll never make it.\"\n\n\n I finished my\nmass\n. \"I'll help\n you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor.\n Name is Simon.\"\n\n\n \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you\n help?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still fresh\u2014comparatively.\n I'll navigate you around. There are\n seven beer tents. How many have you\n got through, so far?\"\n\n\n \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth\n said.\n\n\n I looked at him. \"It's going to be\n a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got\n a nice edge on.\"\n\n\n Outside, as we made our way to\n the next tent, the fair looked like\n every big State-Fair ever seen, except\n it was bigger. Games, souvenir\n stands, sausage stands, rides, side\n shows, and people, people, people.\n\n\n The Hofbr\u00e4u tent was as overflowing\n as the last but we managed to\n find two seats.\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five\n thousand half-swacked voices were\n roaring accompaniment.\nIn Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!\nEins, Zwei, G'sufa!\nAt the\nG'sufa\neverybody upped\n with the mugs and drank each other's\n health.\n\n\n \"This is what I call a real beer\n bust,\" I said approvingly.\n\n\n Arth was waving to a waitress. As\n in the L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u tent, a full quart\n was the smallest amount obtainable.\n\n\n A beer later I said, \"I don't know\n if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"\n\n\n \"Make what?\"\n\n\n \"All seven tents.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\"\n\n\n A waitress was on her way by,\n mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured\n to her for refills.\n\n\n \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I\n asked him, in the way of making\n conversation.\n\n\n \"2183.\"\n\n\n \"2183 where?\"\n\n\n He looked at me, closing one eye\n to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well,\n 2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"\n\n\n \"New Albuquerque? Where's\n that?\"\n\n\n Arth thought about it. Took another\n long pull at the beer. \"Right\n across the way from old Albuquerque,\"\n he said finally. \"Maybe we\n ought to be getting on to the\n Pschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe we ought to eat something\n first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel\n this. We could get some of that barbecued\n ox.\"\n\n\n Arth closed his eyes in pain.\n \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly\n eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"\n I said.\n\n\n \"There's supposed to be considerable\n nourishment in beer.\"\n\n\n That made sense. I yelled, \"\nFr\u00e4ulein!\n Zwei neu bier!\n\"\nSomewhere along in here the fog\n rolled in. When it rolled out again,\n I found myself closing one eye the\n better to read the lettering on my\n earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr\u00e4u.\n Somehow we'd evidently\n navigated from one tent to another.\n\n\n Arth was saying, \"Where's your\n hotel?\"\n\n\n That seemed like a good question.\n I thought about it for a while. Finally\n I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's\n jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.\n I don't think we'll ever make\n it, Arth. How many we got to\n go?\"\n\n\n \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can\n come home with me.\"\n\n\n We drank to that and the fog rolled\n in again.\n\n\n When the fog rolled out, it was\n daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.\n I was sprawled, complete with\n clothes, on one of twin beds. On the\n other bed, also completely clothed,\n was Arth.\n\n\n That sun was too much. I stumbled\n up from the bed, staggered to\n the window and fumbled around for\n a blind or curtain. There was none.\n\n\n Behind me a voice said in horror,\n \"Who ... how ... oh,\nWodo\n,\n where'd you come from?\"\n\n\n I got a quick impression, looking\n out the window, that the Germans\n were certainly the most modern, futuristic\n people in the world. But I\n couldn't stand the light. \"Where's\n the shade,\" I moaned.\n\n\n Arth did something and the window\n went opaque.\n\n\n \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.\n \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd\n appreciate it.\"\n\n\n Arth was sitting on the edge of\n the bed holding his bald head in his\n hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.\n \"You didn't have a hotel.\n What a stupidity. I'll be phased.\n Phased all the way down.\"\n\n\n \"You haven't got a handful of\n aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering\n erect and heading for what\n undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay\n where you are. Don't move. Don't\n touch anything.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.\n \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the\n place. All I've got is a hangover, not\n lice.\"\n\n\n Arth was gone. He came back in\n two or three minutes, box of pills in\n hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n\n\n I took the pill, followed it with a\n glass of water.\nAnd went out like a light.\n\n\n Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want\n another\nmass\n?\"\n\n\n The band was blaring, and five\n thousand half-swacked voices were\n roaring accompaniment.\nIn Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!\nEins, Zwei, G'sufa!\nAt the\nG'sufa\neverybody upped\n with their king-size mugs and drank\n each other's health.\n\n\n My head was killing me. \"This is\n where I came in, or something,\" I\n groaned.\n\n\n Arth said, \"That was last night.\"\n He looked at me over the rim of his\n beer mug.\n\n\n Something, somewhere, was\n wrong. But I didn't care. I finished\n my\nmass\nand then remembered. \"I've\n got to get my bag. Oh, my head.\n Where did we spend last night?\"\n\n\n Arth said, and his voice sounded\n cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n\n\n \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I\n feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.\n I've got to go to the Bahnhof and\n get my luggage.\"\n\n\n Arth didn't put up an argument\n on that. We said good-by and I could\n feel him watching after me as I pushed\n through the tables on the way\n out.\n\n\n At the Bahnhof they could do me\n no good. There were no hotel rooms\n available in Munich. The head was\n getting worse by the minute. The\n fact that they'd somehow managed\n to lose my bag didn't help. I worked\n on that project for at least a couple\n of hours. Not only wasn't the bag\n at the luggage checking station, but\n the attendant there evidently couldn't\n make heads nor tails of the check\n receipt. He didn't speak English and\n my high school German was inadequate,\n especially accompanied by a\n blockbusting hangover.\n\n\n I didn't get anywhere tearing my\n hair and complaining from one end\n of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew\n a blank on the bag.\n\n\n And the head was getting worse\n by the minute. I was bleeding to\n death through the eyes and instead\n of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\n Believe me,\nnobody\nshould drink\n a gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u.\nI decided the hell with it. I took\n a cab to the airport, presented my return\n ticket, told them I wanted to\n leave on the first obtainable plane to\n New York. I'd spent two days at the\nOktoberfest\n, and I'd had it.\n\n\n I got more guff there. Something\n was wrong with the ticket, wrong\n date or some such. But they fixed\n that up. I never was clear on what\n was fouled up, some clerk's error,\n evidently.\n\n\n The trip back was as uninteresting\n as the one over. As the hangover began\n to wear off\u2014a little\u2014I was almost\n sorry I hadn't been able to stay.\n If I'd only been able to get a room I\nwould\nhave stayed, I told myself.\n\n\n From Idlewild, I came directly to\n the office rather than going to my\n apartment. I figured I might as well\n check in with Betty.\n\n\n I opened the door and there I\n found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair\n he had been occupying four\u2014or was\n it five\u2014days before when I'd left.\n I'd lost track of the time.\n\n\n I said to him, \"Glad you're here,\n sir. I can report. Ah, what was it\n you came for? Impatient to hear if\n I'd had any results?\" My mind was\n spinning like a whirling dervish in\n a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of\n his money and had nothing I could\n think of to show for it; nothing but\n the last stages of a grand-daddy\n hangover.\n\n\n \"Came for?\" Mr. Oyster snorted.\n \"I'm merely waiting for your girl to\n make out my receipt. I thought you\n had already left.\"\n\n\n \"You'll miss your plane,\" Betty\n said.\n\n\n There was suddenly a double dip\n of ice cream in my stomach. I walked\n over to my desk and looked down at\n the calendar.\n\n\n Mr. Oyster was saying something\n to the effect that if I didn't leave today,\n it would have to be tomorrow,\n that he hadn't ponied up that thousand\n dollars advance for anything\n less than immediate service. Stuffing\n his receipt in his wallet, he fussed\n his way out the door.\n\n\n I said to Betty hopefully, \"I suppose\n you haven't changed this calendar\n since I left.\"\n\n\n Betty said, \"What's the matter\n with you? You look funny. How did\n your clothes get so mussed? You tore\n the top sheet off that calendar yourself,\n not half an hour ago, just before\n this marble-missing client came\n in.\" She added, irrelevantly, \"Time\n travelers yet.\"\n\n\n I tried just once more. \"Uh, when\n did you first see this Mr. Oyster?\"\n\n\n \"Never saw him before in my\n life,\" she said. \"Not until he came\n in this morning.\"\n\n\n \"This morning,\" I said weakly.\n\n\n While Betty stared at me as though\n it was\nme\nthat needed candling by a\n head shrinker preparatory to being\n sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished\n in my pocket for my wallet, counted\n the contents and winced at the\n pathetic remains of the thousand.\n I said pleadingly, \"Betty, listen,\n how long ago did I go out that door\u2014on\n the way to the airport?\"\n\n\n \"You've been acting sick all morning.\n You went out that door about\n ten minutes ago, were gone about\n three minutes, and then came back.\"\n\"See here,\" Mr. Oyster said (interrupting\n Simon's story), \"did you\n say this was supposed to be amusing,\n young man? I don't find it so. In\n fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.\"\n\n\n Simon shrugged, put one hand to\n his forehead and said, \"That's only\n the first chapter. There are two\n more.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not interested in more,\" Mr.\n Oyster said. \"I suppose your point\n was to show me how ridiculous the\n whole idea actually is. Very well,\n you've done it. Confound it. However,\n I suppose your time, even when\n spent in this manner, has some value.\n Here is fifty dollars. And good day,\n sir!\"\n\n\n He slammed the door after him\n as he left.\n\n\n Simon winced at the noise, took\n the aspirin bottle from its drawer,\n took two, washed them down with\n water from the desk carafe.\n\n\n Betty looked at him admiringly.\n Came to her feet, crossed over and\n took up the fifty dollars. \"Week's\n wages,\" she said. \"I suppose that's\n one way of taking care of a crackpot.\n But I'm surprised you didn't\n take his money and enjoy that vacation\n you've been yearning about.\"\n\n\n \"I did,\" Simon groaned. \"Three\n times.\"\n\n\n Betty stared at him. \"You mean\u2014\"\n\n\n Simon nodded, miserably.\n\n\n She said, \"But\nSimon\n. Fifty thousand\n dollars bonus. If that story was\n true, you should have gone back\n again to Munich. If there was one\n time traveler, there might have\n been\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I keep telling you,\" Simon said\n bitterly, \"I went back there three\n times. There were hundreds of them.\n Probably thousands.\" He took a deep\n breath. \"Listen, we're just going to\n have to forget about it.
