  "article": "The Blue Behemoth\nBy LEIGH BRACKETT\nShannon's Imperial Circus was a jinxed\n\n space-carny leased for a mysterious tour\n\n of the inner worlds. It made a one-night\n\n pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to\n\n find that death stalked it from the\n\n jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories May 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nBucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He\n knocked over the pitcher of\nthil\n, but it didn't matter. The pitcher\n was empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\n very hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\n spring them.\n\n\n \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\n down the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n\n\n I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n\n\n \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\n a curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\n I'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\n Space, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n\n\n \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a\n lot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\n I've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\n eleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!\n Nothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n\n\n I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\n Buckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face\n unless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n\n\n Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\n grey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\n girl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\n slanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\n toward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n\n\n I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\n Shannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n\n\n I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n\n\n Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\n Shannon?\"\n\n\n Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\n pleasantly and said, very gently:\n\n\n \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n\n\n I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if\n he was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\n settled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n\n\n The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\n in dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\n grey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\n clean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\n with their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n\n\n There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\n blue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n\n\n He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n\n\n I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\n back. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\n got my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\n and let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n\n\n Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n\n\n I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\n It knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\n quivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n\n\n Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you,\n Jig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n\n\n The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n \"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n\n\n Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm\n Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\n the table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n\n\n The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\n stayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\n that it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\n ever met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more\n than you could see through sheet metal.\n\n\n I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n \"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\n like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n\n\n The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\n Beamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.\"\nI looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't\n say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\n pitcher of\nthil\non the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n\n\n \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n\n\n Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\n independent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\n the burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n\n\n Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\n started to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n\n\n \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n\n\n He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\n ignored him. He went on, quietly,\n\n\n \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\n valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\n toil and boredom....\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\n\n\n \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\n entertainment of the\u2014\nproper\nsort has been available. I propose to\n remedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\n a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n\n\n Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\n speak, and I kicked him again.\n\n\n \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\n several engagements....\"\n\n\n He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n\n\n \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n\n\n The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\n glared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n\n\n It was Gow, our zoo-man\u2014a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\n colony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\n scenery\u2014scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\n curtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\n than the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n\n\n He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n\n\n \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n\n\n Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\n ain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n\n\n I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n\n\n He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\n fit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\n see? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\n ship'll hold her.\"\n\n\n He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\n cleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n\n\n \"Gertrude?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\n finished for him.\n\n\n \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\n Venusian\ncansin\n. The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\n Brothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n\n\n She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\n a little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\n wouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\n circus than even I could stand.\n\n\n Beamish looked impressed. \"A\ncansin\n. Well, well! The mystery\n surrounding the origin and species of the\ncansin\nis a fascinating\n subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n\n\n We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\n at least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n\n\n It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\n Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\n second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\n stomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n\n\n \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\n agreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\n off half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n\n\n \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\n the morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n\n\n We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\n grab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n\n\n \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\n Here.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\n can get lushed enough on this.\"\n\n\n Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\n he said suddenly,\n\n\n \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n\n \"It may be crooked.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\n yelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n\n\n Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\n where the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\n poked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\nthildatum\n!\"\nIt was pretty late when we got back to the broken-down spaceport where\n Shannon's Imperial Circus was crouching beneath its attachments. Late\n as it was, they were waiting for us. About twenty of them, sitting\n around and smoking and looking very ugly.\n\n\n It was awfully lonesome out there, with the desert cold and restless\n under the two moons. There's a smell to Mars, like something dead and\n dried long past decay, but still waiting. An unhappy smell. The blown\n red dust gritted in my teeth.\n\n\n Bucky Shannon walked out into the glare of the light at the entrance to\n the roped-off space around the main lock. He was pretty steady on his\n feet. He waved and said, \"Hiya, boys.\"\n\n\n They got up off the steps, and the packing cases, and came toward us. I\n grinned and got into my brassies. We felt we owed those boys a lot more\n than money. It grates on a man's pride to have to sneak in and out of\n his own property through the sewage lock. This was the first time in\n weeks we'd come in at the front door.\n\n\n I waved the money in their faces. That stopped them. Very solemnly,\n Bucky and I checked the bills, paid them, and pocketed the receipts.\n Bucky yawned and stretched sleepily.\n\n\n \"Now?\" he said.\n\n\n \"Now,\" I said.\n\n\n We had a lot of fun. Some of the boys inside the ship came out to join\n in. We raised a lot of dust and nobody got killed, quite. We all went\n home happy. They had their money, and we had their blood.\n\n\n The news was all over the ship before we got inside. The freaks and the\n green girl from Tethys who could roll herself like a hoop, and Zurt the\n muscle man from Jupiter, and all the other assorted geeks and kinkers\n and joeys that make up the usual corny carnie were doing nip-ups in the\n passageways and drooling over the thought of steer and toppings.\n\n\n Bucky Shannon regarded them possessively, wiping blood from his nose.\n \"They're good guys, Jig. Swell people. They stuck by me, and I've\n rewarded them.\"\n\n\n I said, \"Sure,\" rather sourly. Bucky hiccoughed.\n\n\n \"Let's go see Gertrude.\"\n\n\n I didn't want to see Gertrude. I never got over feeling funny going\n into the brute tank, especially at night or out in space. I'm a city\n guy, myself. The smell and sound of wildness gives me goose bumps. But\n Bucky was looking stubborn, so I shrugged.\n\n\n \"Okay. But just for a minute. Then we go beddy-bye.\"\n\n\n \"You're a pal, Jif. Bes' li'l' guy inna worl'....\"\n\n\n The fight had just put the topper on him. I was afraid he'd fall down\n the ladder and break his neck. That's why I went along. If I hadn't....\n Oh, well, what's a few nightmares among friends?\n\n\n It was dark down there in the tank. Way off at the other end, there was\n a dim glow. Gow was evidently holding Gertrude's hand. We started down\n the long passageway between the rows of cages and glassed-in tanks and\n compression units.\n\n\n Our footsteps sounded loud and empty on the iron floor. I wasn't\n near as happy as Shannon, and my skin began to crawl a little. It's\n the smell, I think; rank and sour and wild. And the sound of them,\n breathing and rustling in the dark, with the patient hatred walled\n around them as strong as the cage bars.\n\n\n Bucky Shannon lurched against me suddenly. I choked back a yell, and\n then wiped the sweat off my forehead and cursed. The scream came again.\n A high, ragged, whistling screech like nothing this side of hell,\n ripping through the musty darkness. Gertrude, on the wailing wall.\n\n\n It had been quiet. Now every brute in the place let go at the same\n time. My stomach turned clear over. I called Gertrude every name I\n could think of, and I couldn't hear myself doing it. Presently a great\n metallic clash nearly burst my eardrums, and the beasts shut up. Gow\n had them nicely conditioned to that gong.\nBut they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel\n them inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of\n them. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought\u2014like I wanted\n to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night,\n all of a sudden....\n\n\n Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. \"She's gettin'\n worse,\" he said. \"She's lonesome.\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an\n owl's. He swayed slightly. \"That's sure tough.\" He sniffled.\n\n\n I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank\n and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a\n deep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a\ncansin\n. There's only\n two of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will\n make much difference.\n\n\n They're what the brain gang calls an \"end of evolution.\" Seems old\n Dame Nature had an idea that didn't jell. The\ncansins\nwere pretty\n successful for a while, it seems, but something gummed up the works and\n now there's only a few left, way in the deep-swamp country, where even\n the Venusians hardly ever go. Living fossils.\n\n\n I wouldn't know, of course, but Gertrude looks to me like she got stuck\n some place between a dinosaur and a grizzly bear, with maybe a little\n bird blood thrown in. Anyway, she's big.\n\n\n I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. She was crouched in the cage\n with her hands\u2014yeah, hands\u2014hanging over her knees and her snaky head\n sunk into her shoulders, looking out. Just looking. Not at anything.\n Her eyes were way back in deep horny pits, like cold green fire.\n\n\n The lantern light was yellow on her blue-black skin, but it made the\n mane, or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes\n clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like\n old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.\n\n\n Gow said softly, \"She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.\"\n\n\n Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, \"Be reasonable, Gow!\n Nobody's ever seen a male\ncansin\n. There may not even be any.\"\n\n\n Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head.\n The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That\n close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold\n inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....\n\n\n Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, \"You'll have to snap her out of\n this, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.\"\n\n\n He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood\n looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he\n turned to Gertrude.\n\n\n \"I saved her life,\" he said. \"When we bought her out of Hanak's wreck\n and everybody thought she was too hurt to live, I saved her. I know\n her. I can do things with her. But this time....\"\n\n\n He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a\n woman's talking about a sick child.\n\n\n \"This time,\" he said, \"I ain't sure.\"\n\n\n \"Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need\n her.\" I took Shannon's arm. \"Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.\"\n\n\n He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at\n us. Bucky sobbed.\n\n\n \"You were right, Jig,\" he mumbled. \"Circus is no good. I know it. But\n it's all I got. I love it, Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with\n Gertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure,\" I told him. \"Stop crying down my neck.\"\n\n\n We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed\n high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all\n around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.\n\n\n Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist\n rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly\n with blue, cold fire.\n\n\n I yelled, \"Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow\u2014for God's sake!\"\n\n\n I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp\n and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and\n roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all\n I could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.\n\n\n I thought, \"\nSomebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out. Somebody wants\n to kill us!\n\" I tried to yell again. It strangled in my throat. I\n sobbed, and the sweat was thick and cold on me.\n\n\n One of Bucky's dragging, stumbling feet got between mine. We fell. I\n rolled on top of him, covering his face, and buried my own face in the\n hollow of his shoulder.\n\n\n The first snake touched me. It was like a live wire, sliding along the\n back of my neck. I screamed. It came down along my cheek, hunting my\n mouth. There were more of them, burning me through my clothes.\n\n\n Bucky moaned and kicked under me. I remember hanging on and thinking,\n \"This is it. This is it, and oh God, I'm scared!\"\n\n\n Then I went out.\nII\n\n\n Kanza the Martian croaker, was bending over me when I woke up. His\n little brown face was crinkled with laughter. He'd lost most of his\n teeth, and he gummed\nthak\n-weed. It smelt.\n\n\n \"You pretty, Mis' Jig,\" he giggled. \"You funny like hell.\"\n\n\n He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt. I cursed him and\n said, \"Where's Shannon? How is he?\"\n\n\n \"Mis' Bucky okay. You save life. You big hero, Mis' Jig. Mis' Gow come\n nickuhtime get snakes. You hero. Haw! You funny like hell!\"\n\n\n I said, \"Yeah,\" and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down\n a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the\n washstand\u2014I was in my own cell\u2014and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned\n snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch\n plaid. I felt sick.\n\n\n Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was\n a big burn across his neck. He said:\n\n\n \"Beamish is here with his lawyer.\"\n\n\n I picked up my shirt. \"Right with you.\"\n\n\n Kanza went out, still giggling. Bucky closed the door.\n\n\n \"Jig,\" he said, \"those vapor worms were all right when we went in.\n Somebody followed us down and let them out. On purpose.\"\n\n\n I hurt all over. I growled, \"With that brain, son, you should go far.\n Nobody saw anything, of course?\" Bucky shook his head.\n\n\n \"Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?\"\n\n\n \"Beamish. He realizes he's been gypped.\"\n\n\n \"One hundred U.C.'s,\" said Bucky softly, \"for a few lousy swampedge\n mining camps. It stinks, Jig. You think we should back out?\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"You're the boss man. I'm only the guy that beats off the\n creditors.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" Bucky said reflectively. \"And I hear starvation isn't a\n comfortable death. Okay, Jig. Let's go sign.\" He put his hand on the\n latch and looked at my feet. \"And\u2014uh\u2014Jig, I....\"\n\n\n I said, \"Skip it. The next time, just don't trip me up, that's all!\"\n\n\n We had a nasty trip to Venus. Gertrude kept the brute tank on edge,\n and Gow, on the rare occasions he came up for air, went around looking\n like a disaster hoping to happen. To make it worse, Zurt the Jovian\n strong-man got hurt during the take-off, and the Mercurian cave-cat had\n kittens.\n\n\n Nobody would have minded that, only one of 'em had only four legs. It\n lived just long enough to scare that bunch of superstitious dopes out\n of their pants. Circus people are funny that way.\n\n\n Shannon and I did a little quiet sleuthing, but it was a waste of time.\n Anybody in the gang might have let those electric worms out on us. It\n didn't help any to know that somebody, maybe the guy next to you at\n dinner, was busy thinking ways to kill you. By the time we hit Venus, I\n was ready to do a Brodie out the refuse chute.\n\n\n Shannon set the crate down on the edge of Nahru, the first stop on our\n itinerary. I stood beside him, looking out the ports at the scenery. It\n was Venus, all right. Blue mud and thick green jungle and rain, and a\n bunch of ratty-looking plastic shacks huddling together in the middle\n of it. Men in slickers were coming out for a look.\n\n\n I saw Beamish's sleek yacht parked on a cradle over to the left, and\n our router's runabout beside it. Bucky Shannon groaned.\n\n\n \"A blue one, Jig. A morgue if I ever saw one!\"\n\n\n I snarled, \"What do you want, with this lousy dog-and-pony show!\" and\n went out. He followed. The gang was converging on the lock, but they\n weren't happy. You get so you can feel those things. The steamy Venus\n heat was already sneaking into the ship.\n\n\n While we passed the hatchway to the brute tank, I could hear Gertrude,\n screaming.\nThe canvasmen were busy setting up the annex, slopping and cursing in\n the mud. The paste brigade was heading for the shacks. Shannon and I\n stood with the hot rain running off our slickers, looking.\n\n\n I heard a noise behind me and looked around. Ahra the Nahali woman was\n standing in the mud with her arms up and her head thrown back, and her\n triangular mouth open like a thirsty dog. She didn't have anything on\n but her blue-green, hard scaled hide, and she was chuckling. It didn't\n sound nice.\n\n\n You find a lot of Nahali people in side-shows, doing tricks with\n the electric power they carry in their own bodies. They're Venusian\n middle-swampers, they're not human, and they never forget it.\n\n\n Ahra opened her slitted red eyes and looked at me and laughed with\n white reptilian teeth.\n\n\n \"Death,\" she whispered. \"Death and trouble. The jungle tells me. I can\n smell it in the swamp wind.\"\n\n\n The hot rain sluiced over her. She shivered, and the pale skin under\n her jaw pulsed like a toad's, and her eyes were red.\n\n\n \"The deep swamps are angry,\" she whispered. \"Something has been taken.\n They are angry, and I smell death in the wind!\"\n\n\n She turned away, laughing, and I cursed her, and my stomach was tight\n and cold. Bucky said,\n\n\n \"Let's eat if they have a bar in this dump.\"\n\n\n We weren't half way across the mud puddle that passed as a landing\n field when a man came out of a shack on the edge of the settlement. We\n could see him plainly, because he was off to one side of the crowd.\n\n\n He fell on his knees in the mud, making noises. It took him three or\n four tries to get our names out clear enough to understand.\n\n\n Bucky said, \"Jig\u2014it's Sam Kapper.\"\n\n\n We started to run. The crowd, mostly big unshaken miners, wheeled\n around to see what was happening. People began to close in on the man\n who crawled and whimpered in the mud.\n\n\n Sam Kapper was a hunter, supplying animals to zoos and circuses and\n carnivals. He'd given us good deals a couple of times, when we weren't\n too broke, and we were pretty friendly.\n\n\n I hadn't seen him for three seasons. I remembered him as a bronzed,\n hard-bitten guy, lean and tough as a twist of tung wire. I felt sick,\n looking down at him.\n\n\n Bucky started to help him up. Kapper was crying, and he jerked all over\n like animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over\n and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.\n\n\n I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I\n only caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't\n realize until later that he looked familiar.\n\n\n We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a\n couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled\n the curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the\n cigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.\n\n\n Bucky said gently, \"Okay, Sam. Relax. What's the trouble?\"\nKapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines\n of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\n with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n\n\n He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\n and brought it out.\"\n\n\n The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\n me,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n\n\n \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\n got to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\n wouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n\n\n He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\n how they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\n I've got to....\"\n\n\n Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\n suddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n\n\n Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\n grabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\n stood out like guy wires.\n\n\n \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\n Promise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\n breathing.\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n\n\n Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\n air. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\n use. Kapper whispered,\n\n\n \"\nCansin\n. Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n\n\n \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n\n\n I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\n was standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\n made a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n\n\n Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\n Kapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n\n\n \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n\n\n \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n\n\n I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\n Beamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\n pushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n\n\n \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n\n\n Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\n told him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\n over to the bar.\n\n\n I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\n place. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\n of miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n\n\n Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\n did any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n\n\n The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\n was a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\n coiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n\n\n I leaned on the bar. \"\nLhak\n,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\n green bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n\n\n \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\n cold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n\n\n \"\nSelak\n,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n\n\n I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\n behind me. And I remembered him, then.\n",
