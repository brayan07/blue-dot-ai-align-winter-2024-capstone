HALEY\nCasey Ritter, the guy who never turned\n \ndown a dare, breathed a prayer to the gods\n \nof idiots and spacemen, and headed in toward\n \nthe great red spot of terrible Jupiter.\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThose methane and ammonia planets, take it from me, they're the\n dead-end of creation, and why the Old Man ever thought them up I'll\n never know. I never thought I'd mess around any of them, but things\n can sure happen. A man can get himself backed into a corner in this\n little old solar system. It just ain't big enough for a gent of scope\n and talent; and the day the Solar System Customs caught me red-handed\n smuggling Kooleen crystals in from Mars, I knew I was in that corner,\n and sewed up tight.\n\n\n Sure, the crystals are deadly, but I was smuggling them legitimately,\n in a manner of speaking, for this doctor to experiment with. He wasn't\n going to sell them for dope. But\u2014and this was the 'but' that was\n likely to deprive the System of my activities\u2014even experimenting with\n them was illegal even if it needed to be done; also, I had promised not\n to rat on him before taking the job.\n\n\n Well, Casey Ritter may be a lot of things we won't mention, but he\n doesn't rat on his clients. So there I was, closeted with the ten\n members of the S.S. Customs Court, getting set to hear the gavel\n fall and the head man intone the sentence that would take me out of\n circulation for a long, long time. And instead, blast me, if they\n didn't foul me with this trip to good old Jupiter.\n\n\n I didn't get it at first. I'd argued with 'em, but inside I'd been all\n set for the sentence, and even sort of reconciled to it. I could even\n hear the words in my mind. But they didn't match what the judge was\n saying. I stood there gaping like a beached fish while I sorted it out.\n Then I croaked, \"Jupiter! What for? Are you running outa space in stir?\n Want to choke me to death in chlorine instead?\" Being civil to the\n court didn't seem important just then. Jupiter was worse than the pen,\n a lot worse. Jupiter was a death sentence.\n\n\n The senior judge rapped sharply with his gavel. He frowned me down and\n then nodded at the judge on his right. This bird, a little old hank of\n dried-up straw, joined his fingertips carefully, cleared his scrawny\n throat, and told me what for.\n\n\n \"You've no doubt heard tales of the strange population of Jupiter,\"\n he said. \"Every spaceman has, I am sure. Insect-like creatures who\n manifestly migrated there from some other system and who inhabit\n the Red Spot of the planet, floating in some kind of artificial\n anti-gravity field in the gaseous portion of the atmosphere\u2014\"\n\n\n I snorted. \"Aw, hell, judge, that's just one of those screwy fairy\n tales! How could any\u2014\"\n\n\n The senior judge rapped ferociously, and I skidded to a halt. Our\n little story teller patiently cleared his skinny throat again.\n \"I assure you it is no fairy tale. We possess well-authenticated\n photographs of these inhabitants, and if you are prepared to visit them\n and in some way worm from them the secret of their anti-gravity field,\n the government stands ready to issue you a full pardon as well as a\n substantial monetary reward. Your talents, Mr. Ritter, seem, shall we\n say, eminently suited to the task.\"\nHe beamed at me. I looked around. They were all beaming. At me!\n Suddenly I smelled a rat as big as an elephant. That whole Kooleen\n caper: Had it been just a trap to lead me straight to this? I hadn't\n been able to figure how they'd cracked my setup....\n\n\n At the thought my larynx froze up tight. This was worse than I'd\n thought. Government men trapping me and then beaming at me. And a full\n pardon. And a reward. Oh, no! I told myself, it wasn't possible. Not\n when I already had more counts against me than a cur has fleas. Not\n unless it was a straight suicide mission!\n\n\n I feebly massaged my throat. \"Pictures?\" I whispered. \"Show me 'em.\"\n Crude, but it was all I could squeeze out.\n\n\n I squeezed out more when I saw those pictures, though. Those\n inhabitants were charming, just charming if you like scorpions. Well,\n a cross between a scorpion and a grasshopper, to be accurate. Floating\n among that red stuff, they showed up a kind of sickly purple turning to\n gangrene around the edges.\n\n\n The bleat of anguish that accompanied my first view of those beauties\n had taken my voice again. \"How big?\" I whispered.\n\n\n He shrugged, trying for nonchalance. \"About the size of a man, I\n believe.\"\n\n\n I raised my shrinking head. \"Take me to jail!\" I said firmly, and\n collapsed onto my chair.\n\n\n A crafty-eyed buzzard across the table leaned toward me. \"So this is\n the great Casey Ritter, daredevil of the Solar System!\" he sneered.\n \"Never loses a bet, never turns down a dare!\"\n\n\n I shuddered. \"You're telling that one! And besides, a man's got to draw\n the line somewhere. And I'm drawing it right here. Take me to jail!\"\n\n\n They were really stumped. They hadn't expected me to take this attitude\n at all. No doubt they had it figured that I'd gratefully throw myself\n into a sea of ammonia among man-size scorpions just for the hell of\n it. Nuts! After all, in the pen a man can eat and breathe, and a guard\n won't reach in and nip off an arm or leg while he's got his back\n turned. How stupid could they get?\n\n\n When I finally wore them down and got to my little cell, I looked\n around it with a feeling of real coziness. I even patted the walls\n chummily and snapped a salute at the guard. It makes me grind my molars\n now to think of it. The way that bunch of stuffed shirts in the S.S.C.\n made a gold-barred chimpanzee out of me has broken my spirit and\n turned me into an honest trader. Me, Casey Ritter, slickest slicker in\n the Solar System, led like a precious infant right where I'd flatly\n refused to go! In plain English, I underestimated the enemy. Feeling\n safe and secure in the grip of the good old Iron College, I relaxed.\n\n\n At this strategic point, the enemy planted a stoolie on me. Not in my\n cell block. They were too smart for that. But we met at recreation, and\n his mug seemed familiar, like a wisp of smoke where no smoke has got a\n right to be; and after awhile I braced him.\n\n\n I was right. I'd met the shrimp before when I was wound up in an\n asteroid real estate racket. Pard Hoskins was his alias, and he had the\n tag of being a real slick operator. We swapped yarns for about a week\n when we met, and then I asked him what's his rap this trip.\n\n\n \"Oh, a pretty good jolt if they can keep hold of me,\" he says. \"I just\n made a pass at the Killicut Emeralds, that's all, and got nabbed.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\" I moaned. \"What were you trying to do, start a feud between\n us and Mars?\"\n\n\n He shrugged, but his little black-currant eyes began to sparkle with\n real passion, the high voltage kind that only a woman in a million, or\n a million in a bank, can kindle in a guy. \"Buddy,\" he said reverently,\n \"I'd start more than that just to get me mitts on them stones again!\n Why, you ain't never seen jools till you've seen them! Big as hen's\n eggs, an even dozen of 'em; and flawless, I'm a-shoutin', not a flaw!\"\n His eyes watered at the memory, yearning like a hound-dog's over a\n fresh scent.\n\n\n I couldn't believe it. Those emeralds were in the inner shrine of the\n super-sacred, super-secret temple of the cavern-dwelling tribe of\n Killicuts on Mars\u2014the real aborigines. Bleachies, we call them, sort\n of contemptuously; but those Bleachies are a rough lot when they're\n mad, and if Pard had really got near those emeralds, he should be\n nothing but a heap of cleaned bones by now. Either he was the world's\n champion liar or its bravest son, and either way I took my hat off to\n him.\n\n\n \"How'd you make the getaway?\" I asked, taking him at his word.\n\n\n He looked loftily past me. \"Sorry. Gotta keep that a secret. Likewise\n where I cached 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Cached what?\"\n\n\n \"The rocks, stupe.\"\n\n\n I hardly heard the cut. \"You mean you really did get away with them?\"\n My jaw must've been hanging down a foot, because I'd just been playing\n along with him, not really believing him, and now all of a sudden I\n somehow knew that he'd really lifted those emeralds. But how? It was\n impossible. I'd investigated once myself.\n\n\n He nodded and then moved casually away. I looked up and saw a guard\n coming.\n\n\n That night I turned on my hard prison cot until my bones were so much\n jelly, trying to figure that steal. The next morning I got up burning\n with this fever for information, only to find that Pard had got himself\n put in solitary for mugging a guard, and that really put the heat on\n me. I chewed my fingernails down to the quick by the time he got out a\n week later.\nBy that time he really had me hooked. I'd of sworn he was leveling\n with me. But he wouldn't tell me how he'd worked the steal. Instead,\n he opened up on the trade he'd booked for the string. He said, \"When I\n chisel me way outa this squirrel cage, I'm gonna hit fer good old Jupe\n and sell 'em to Akroida. She's nuts about jools. What that old girl\n won't give me fer 'em\u2014\" He whistled appreciatively, thinking about it.\n\n\n \"Jupiter!\" I goggled at him. \"Akroida! Who's she?\"\n\n\n He looked at me as if I hadn't yet got out from under the rock where he\n was sure I'd been born. \"Don't you know nothin', butterhead?\"\n\n\n From him I took it. I even waited patiently till the master spoke\n again. The memory still makes me fry.\n\n\n \"Akroida,\" he explained in his own sweet time, \"is the queen-scorp\n of them idiotic scorpions that lives on Jupiter. I sold her the\n Halcyon Diamond that disappeared from the World Museum five years ago,\n remember?\" He winked broadly. \"It come from Mars in the first place,\n you know. Mars! What a place fer jools! Damn desert's lousy with 'em,\n if it wasn't so much trouble to dig 'em out\u2014\" He went off into a dream\n about the rocks on Mars but I jerked him back.\n\n\n \"You mean those scorpions have really got brains?\"\n\n\n \"Brains!\" he snorted. \"Have they got brains! Why, they're smarter than\n people! And not ferocious, neither, in spite of how they look, if you\n just leave 'em alone. That's all they want, just to be left alone.\n Peace an' quiet, and lots of methane and ammonia and arsenic, that's\n fer them. Besides, the space suit rig you got to wear, they can't bite\n you. Akroida's not a bad old girl. Partial to arsenic on her lettuce,\n so I brought her a hundred pounds of the stuff, an' she went fer that\n almost like it was diamonds, too. Did I rate around there fer awhile!\"\n He sighed regretfully. \"But then I went and made her mad, an' I'm kinda\n persona non grata there right now. By the time I gnaw outa this here\n cheese trap, though, I figger she'll be all cooled off and ready fer\n them emeralds.\"\n\n\n I went back to my cot that night, and this time instead of biting my\n nails, I bit myself. So I faced it. Casey Ritter lost his nerve, and\n along with it, the chance of a lifetime. A better man than me had\n already penetrated the Great Red Spot of old Jupiter and come out\n alive. That thought ate me to the quick, and I began to wonder if it\n was too late, after all. I could hardly wait for morning to come, so\n that I could pry more information out of Pard Hoskins.\n\n\n But I didn't see Pard for a few days. And then, a week later, a group\n of lifers made a break that didn't jell, and the whole bunch was locked\n up in the blockhouse, the special building reserved for escapees. Pard\n Hoskins was in the bunch. He'd never get out of there, and he knew it.\n So did I.\n\n\n For three more days I worked down my knuckles, my nails being gone,\n while I sat around all hunched up, wondering feverishly if Pard would\n make a deal about those emeralds. Then I broke down and sent out a\n letter to the S.S.C.\n\n\n The Big Sneer of the conference table promptly dropped in on me,\n friendly as a bottle of strychnine. But for a lad headed for Jupiter\n that was good training, so I sneered right back at him, explained the\n caper, and we both paid a visit to Pard. In two days the deal was made\n and the caper set up. There were a few bits of info that Pard had to\n shell out, like where the emeralds were, and how to communicate with\n those scorpions, and how he'd made Akroida mad.\n\n\n \"I put on a yeller slicker,\" he confessed sadly. \"That there ammonia\n mist was eatin' into the finish on my spacesuit, so I draped this\n here slicker around me to sorta fancy up the rig before goin' in to\n an audience with the old rip.\" He shook his head slowly. \"The kid\n that took me in was colorblind, so I didn't have no warning at all.\n I found out that them scorpions can't stand yeller. It just plain\n drives them nuts! Thought they'd chaw me up and spit me out into the\n chlorine before I could get outa the damn thing. If my colorblind pal\n hadn't helped me, they'd of done it, too. And Akroida claimed I done it\n a-purpose to upset her.\"\n\n\n Then he winked at me. \"But then I got off in a corner and cooked up\n some perfume that drives them nuts the other way; sorta frantic with\n ecstasy, like the book says. Didn't have a chance to try it on Akroida,\n though. She wouldn't give me another audience. It's in the stuff they\n cleaned outa me room: a poiple bottle with a bright green stopper.\"\n\n\n He ruminated a few minutes. \"Tell you what, chump. Make them shell out\n with a green an' poiple spacesuit\u2014them's the real Jupiter colors\u2014an'\n put just a touch o' that there perfume on the outside of it. Akroida'll\n do anything fer you if she just gets a whiff. Just anything! But\n remember, don't use but a drop. It's real powerful.\"\nII\n\n\n Real powerful, said the man. What an understatement! But the day I was\n set adrift in that sea of frozen ammonia clouds mixed with nice cozy\n methane gas I sure prayed for it to be powerful, and I clutched that\n tiny bottle like that boy Aladdin clutching his little old lamp.\n\n\n I'd had a lot of cooperation getting that far. An Earth patrol had\n slipped down onto the Red Desert of Mars and picked up the Killicut\n Emeralds from where Pard Hoskins had cached them; and safe out in space\n again, we had pored over that string of green headlights practically\n slobbering. But the Big Sneer of the S.S.C., the fellow that had got\n me into this caper, was right there to take the joy out of it all and\n to remind me that this was public service, strictly.\n\n\n \"These\u2014\" he had proclaimed with a disdainful flourish, like a placer\n miner pointing to a batch of fool's gold\u2014\"These jewels are as nothing,\n Ritter, compared with the value of the secret you are to buy with\n them. And be assured that if you're man enough to effect the trade\u2014\"\n He paused, his long nose twitching cynically\u2014\"IF you succeed, your\n reward will be triple what you could get for them in any market. Added\n to which, IF you succeed, you will be a free man.\"\n\n\n That twitch of the nose riled me no little. \"I ain't failed yet!\" I\n snarled at him. \"Just you wait till I do, feller!\" I slipped the string\n of emeralds back into its little safe. \"Instead of sniping at me, why\n don't you get that brain busy and set our rendezvous?\"\n\n\n With that we got down to business and fixed a meeting point out on\n Jupiter's farthest moon; then they took me in to the edge of Jupiter's\n ice-cloud and turned me loose in a peanut of a space boat with old Jupe\n looming ahead bigger than all outdoors and the Red Spot dead ahead. I\n patted my pretty enameled suit, which was a study in paris green and\n passionate purple.\n\n\n I patted the three hundred pounds of arsenic crystals for Akroida and\n anyone else I might have to bribe. I anxiously examined my suit's air\n and water containers and the heating unit that would keep them in\n their proper state. I had already gone over the space boat. Yeah, I\n was as nervous as a cat with new kittens. Feeling again for my little\n bottle of horrid stench, I breathed a prayer to the god of idiots and\n spacemen, and headed in. The big ship was long gone, and I felt like a\n mighty small and naked microbe diving into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n That famous Red Spot was that big, too. It kept expanding until the\n whole universe was a fierce, raw luminous red. Out beyond it at first\n there had been fringes of snow-white frozen ammonia, but now it was all\n dyed redder than Mars. Then I took the plunge right into it. Surprise!\n The stuff was plants! Plants as big as meadows, bright red, floating\n around in those clouds of frozen ammonia like seaweed! Then I noticed\n that the ammonia around them wasn't frozen any more and peeked at the\n outside thermometer I couldn't believe it. It was above zero. Then I\n forgot about the temperature because it dawned on me that I was lost. I\n couldn't see a thing but drifting ammonia fog and those tangles of red\n floating plants like little islands all around. Cutting down the motor,\n I eased along.\n\n\n But my green boat must have showed up like a lighthouse in all that\n red, because it wasn't long until I spotted a purple and green\n hopper-scorp traveling straight toward me, sort of rowing along with\n a pair of stubby wings. He didn't seem to be making much effort, even\n though he was climbing vertically up from the planet. In fact, he\n didn't seem to be climbing at all but just going along horizontally.\n There just wasn't any up or down in that crazy place. It must be that\n anti-grav field, I concluded. The air was getting different, too, now\n that I was further in. I'm no chemist, and I couldn't have gotten out\n there to experiment if I had been, but those plants were certainly\n doing something to that ammonia and methane. The fog thinned, for one\n thing, and the temperature rose to nearly forty.\n\n\n Meanwhile the hopper-scorp reached the ship. Hastily I squirted some of\n my Scorpion-Come-Hither lure on the chest of my spacesuit, opened the\n lock, and popped out, brave as could be. Face to face with that thing,\n though, I nearly lost my grip on the handle. In fact, I'd have fainted\n dead away right there if Pard Hoskins hadn't been there already and\n lived. If that little shrimp could do it, I could, too.\n\n\n I braced up and tapped out the greeting Pard had taught me. My\n fiendish-looking opponent tapped right back, inquiring why the hell\n I was back so soon when I knew that Akroida was all set to carve me\n into steaks for just any meal. But the tone was friendly and even\n intimate\u2014or rather, the taps were. There was even a rather warm\n expression discernible in the thing's eyes, so I took heart and decided\n to ignore the ferocious features surrounding those eyes. After all, the\n poor sinner's map was made of shell, and he wasn't responsible for its\n expression.\n\n\n I tapped back very politely that he must be mistaking me for someone\n else. \"I've never been here before, and so I've never met the charming\n lady,\" I informed him. \"However, I have something very special in the\n way of jewels\u2014not with me, naturally\u2014and the rumor is that she might\n be interested.\"\n\n\n He reared back at that, and reaching up, plucked his right eye out of\n the socket and reeled it out to the end of a two-foot tentacle, and\n then he examined me with it just like an old-time earl with one of\n those things they called monocles. Pard hadn't warned me about those\n removable eyes, for reasons best known to himself. I still wake up\n screaming....\n\n\n Anyway, when that thing pulled out its eye and held it toward me, I\n backed up against the side of the ship like I'd been half-electrocuted.\n Then I gagged. But I could still remember that I had to live in that\n suit for awhile, so I held on. Then that monstrosity reeled in the eye,\n and I gagged again.\n\n\n My actions didn't bother him a bit. \"Jewels, did you say?\" he tapped\n out thoughtfully, just like an ordinary business man, and I managed to\n tap out yes. He drifted closer; close enough to get a whiff....\nA shudder of ecstasy stiffened him. His head and eyes rolled with it,\n and he wafted closer still. Right there I began to harbor a premonition\n that there might be such a thing as being too popular in Scorpdom, but\n I thrust this sneak-thief idea back into limbo.\n\n\n Taking advantage of his condition, I boldly tapped out, \"How's about\n taking me on a guided tour through this red spinach patch to Akroida,\n old pal?\" Or words to that effect.\n\n\n He lolled his hideous cranium practically on my shoulder. \"Anything!\n Just anything you desire, my dearest friend.\"\n\n\n I tried to back off from him a bit, but the ship stopped me. \"I'm Casey\n Ritter. What's your label, chum?\"\n\n\n \"Attaboy,\" he ticked coyly.\n\n\n \"Attaboy?\" Things blurred around me. It couldn't be. It was just plain\n nuts. Then I got a glimmer through my paralyzed gray matter. \"Who named\n you that?\"\n\n\n He simpered. \"My dear friend, Pard Hoskins.\"\n\n\n I breathed again. How simple could I get? He'd already mistaken me for\n Pard, hadn't he? Then I remembered something else. \"How come you aren't\n mad at him? Don't you hate yellow, too?\"\n\n\n He hung his silly head. \"I fear I am colorblind,\" he confessed sadly.\n\n\n Right there I forgave him for pulling that eye on me. He was the guide\n I needed, the one who had got Pard out alive. I almost hugged him.\n \"Lead off, old pal,\" I sang out, and then had to tap it. \"I'll follow\n in my boat.\"\n\n\n Well, I'd met the first of the brood and was still alive. Not only\n alive but loved and cherished, thanks to Pard's inventiveness and to\n a kindly fate which had sent Pard's old pal my way. A great man, Pard\n Hoskins. How had he made friends with the brute in the first place?\n\n\n Being once more inside my spaceboat, I raised my helmet, which was like\n one of those head-pieces they used to put on suits of armor instead of\n the usual plastic bubble. And it was rigged out with phony antennae and\n mandibles and other embellishments calculated to interest my hosts.\n Whether it interested them or not, it was plenty uncomfortable for me.\n\n\n Peeking out the porthole I saw that my guide was fidgeting and looking\n over his shoulder at my ship, so I eased in the controls and edge after\n him. To my surprise a vapor shot out of a box that I had taken for a\n natural lump on his back, and he darted away from me. I opened the\n throttle and tore after him among the immense red blobs that were now\n beginning to be patterned with dozens of green-and-purple scorpions,\n all busy filling huge baskets with buds and tendrils, no doubt.\n\n\n Other scorpions oared and floated about in twos and threes in a free\n and peaceable manner that almost made me forget that I was scared to\n death of them, and they stared at my boat with only a mild interest\n that would have taught manners to most of my fellow citizens of Earth.\n\n\n It wasn't until we had covered some two hundred miles of this that\n something began to loom out of the mist, and I forgot the playboys and\n the field workers. It loomed higher and higher. Then we burst out into\n a clearing several miles in diameter, and I saw the structure clearly.\n It was red, like everything else in this screwy place, and could only\n have been built out of compressed blocks of the red plant.\n\n\n In shape it was a perfect octagon. It hung poised in the center of the\n cleared space, suspended on nothing. It had to be at least a mile in\n diameter, and its sides were pierced with thousands of openings through\n which its nightmare occupants appeared and disappeared, drifting in\n and out like they had all the time in the world. I stared until my\n eyeballs felt paralyzed.\n\n\n Pard was right again. These critters had brains. And my S.S.C.\n persecutor was right, too. That anti-grav secret was worth more than\n any string of rocks in the system, including the Killicut Emeralds.\n\n\n Then I swallowed hard. Attaboy was leading me straight across to a\n window. Closing my helmet, my fingers fumbled badly. My brain was\n fumbling, too. \"Zero hour, chump!\" it told me, and I shuddered. Picking\n up the first hundred pounds of the arsenic, I wobbled over to the\n airlock.\nIII\n\n\n That palace was like nothing on earth. Naturally, you'll say, it's\n on Jupiter. But I mean it was even queerer than that. It was like no\n building on any planet at all. And, in fact, it wasn't on a planet; it\n was floating up there only two hundred miles in from the raw edge of\n space.\n\n\n In that building everything stayed right where it was put. If it was\n put twelve or fifty feet up off the floor, it stayed there. Not that\n there wasn't gravity. There was plenty of gravity to suit me\u2014just\n right, in fact\u2014and still they had furniture sitting around in the air\n as solid as if on a floor. Which was fine for flying hopper-scorps, but\n what about Casey Ritter, who hadn't cultivated even a feather?\n\n\n Attaboy, however, had the answers for everything. Towing me from the\n airlock to the window ledge, he again sniffed that delectable odor on\n my chest, caressed me with his front pair of legs while I manfully\n endured, and then without warning tossed me onto his back above the\n little box and flew off with me along a tunnel with luminous red walls.\n\n\n We finally came to the central hall of the palace, and at the sight\n of all that space dropping away, I clutched at his shell and nearly\n dropped the arsenic. But he didn't have any brakes I could grab, so he\n just flew out into mid-air in a room that could have swallowed a city\n block, skyscrapers and all. It was like a mammoth red cavern, and it\n glowed like the inside of a red light.\n\n\n No wonder those scorpions like green and purple. What a relief from all\n that red!\n\n\n A patch in the middle of the hall became a floating platform holding up\n a divan twenty feet square covered with stuff as green as new spring\n grass, and in the center of this reclined Akroida. It had to be. Who\n else could look like that? No one, believe me, boys and girls, no one!\n\n\n Our little Akroida was a pure and peculiarly violent purple\u2014not a\n green edge anywhere. She was even more purple than my fancy enameled\n space suit, and she was big enough to comfortably fill most of that\n twenty-foot couch. To my shrinking eyes right then she looked as big as\n a ten-ton cannon and twice as mean and dangerous. She was idly nipping\n here and there as though she was just itching to take a hunk out of\n somebody, and the way the servants were edging away out around her, I\n could see they didn't want to get in range. I didn't blame them a bit.\n Under the vicious sag of her Roman nose, her mandibles kept grinding,\n shaking the jewels that were hung all over her repulsive carcass, and\n making the Halcyon Diamond on her chest blaze like a bonfire.\n\n\n Attaboy dumped me onto a floating cushion where I lay clutching and\n shuddering away from her and from the void all around me, and went\n across to her alone with the arsenic.\n\n\n Akroida rose up sort of languidly on an elbow that was all stripped\n bone and sharp as a needle. She pulled an eyeball out about a yard and\n scanned Attaboy and the box. He closed in to the couch all hunched\n over, ducked his head humbly half-a-dozen times, and pushed the box\n over beside her. Akroida eased her eyeball back, opened the box and\n sniffed, and then turned to Attaboy with a full-blown Satanic grin. I\n could hear her question reverberate away over where I was.\n\n\n \"Who from?\" asked Akroida.\n\n\n That conversation was telegraphed to me blow by blow by the actions of\n those hopper-scorps. I didn't need their particular brand of Morse Code\n at all.\n\n\n \"Who from?\" Attaboy cringed lower and blushed a purple all-over blush.\n \"Dear lady, it is from an interspace trader who possesses some truly\n remarkable jewels,\" he confessed coyly.\n\n\n Akroida toyed with the Halcyon Diamond and ignored the bait. \"His\n name?\" she demanded. And when he told her, with a bad stutter in\n his code, she reared up higher on her skinny elbow and glared in my\n direction. \"Casey Ritter? Never heard of him. Where's he from?\"\n\n\n Well, after all, she wasn't blind. He had to confess. \"I\u2014uh\u2014the\n stones were so amazing, Royal Akroida, that I didn't pay much attention\n to the\u2014uh\u2014trader. He does seem to resemble an\u2014ah\u2014earthman.\" He\n ducked his head and fearfully waited.\n\n\n A sort of jerking quiver ran through Akroida. She reared up even\n higher. Her mean Roman nose twitched. \"An earthman? Like Pard Hoskins?\"\n\n\n Attaboy shrank smaller and smaller. He could only nod dumbly.\n\n\n The storm broke, all right. That old dame let out a scream like a\n maddened stallion and began to thrash around and flail her couch with\n that dragon's tail of hers.\n",
