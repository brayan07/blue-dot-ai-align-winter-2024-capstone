Oh,\nI'm A Stranger\n \nHere Myself\nBy MACK REYNOLDS\nThe\n Place de France is the\n town's hub. It marks the end\n of Boulevard Pasteur, the main\n drag of the westernized part of\n the city, and the beginning of\n Rue de la Libert\u00e9, which leads\n down to the Grand Socco and\n the medina. In a three-minute\n walk from the Place de France\n you can go from an ultra-modern,\n California-like resort to the\n Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.\n\n\n It's quite a town, Tangier.\n\n\n King-size sidewalk cafes occupy\n three of the strategic\n corners on the Place de France.\n The Cafe de Paris serves the\n best draft beer in town, gets all\n the better custom, and has three\n shoeshine boys attached to the\n establishment. You can sit of a\n sunny morning and read the\n Paris edition of the New York\nHerald Tribune\nwhile getting\n your shoes done up like mirrors\n for thirty Moroccan francs\n which comes to about five cents\n at current exchange.\n\n\n You can sit there, after the\n paper's read, sip your expresso\n and watch the people go by.\n\n\n Tangier is possibly the most\n cosmopolitan city in the world.\n In native costume you'll see\n Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue\n Man, and occasionally a Senegalese\n from further south. In\n European dress you'll see Japs\n and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,\n Levantines and Filipinos, North\n Americans and South Americans,\n and, of course, even Europeans\u2014from\n both sides of the\n Curtain.\n\n\n In Tangier you'll find some of\n the world's poorest and some of\n the richest. The poorest will try\n to sell you anything from a\n shoeshine to their not very lily-white\n bodies, and the richest will\n avoid your eyes, afraid\nyou\nmight try to sell them something.\n\n\n In spite of recent changes, the\n town still has its unique qualities.\n As a result of them the permanent\n population includes\n smugglers and black-marketeers,\n fugitives from justice and international\n con men, espionage\n and counter-espionage agents,\n homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,\n drug addicts, displaced\n persons, ex-royalty, and subversives\n of every flavor. Local law\n limits the activities of few of\n these.\n\n\n Like I said, it's quite a town.\nI looked up from my\nHerald\n Tribune\nand said, \"Hello, Paul.\n Anything new cooking?\"\n\n\n He sank into the chair opposite\n me and looked around for\n the waiter. The tables were all\n crowded and since mine was a\n face he recognized, he assumed\n he was welcome to intrude. It was\n more or less standard procedure\n at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't\n a place to go if you wanted to\n be alone.\n\n\n Paul said, \"How are you,\n Rupert? Haven't seen you for\n donkey's years.\"\n\n\n The waiter came along and\n Paul ordered a glass of beer.\n Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced\n little man. I vaguely remembered\n somebody saying he\n was from Liverpool and in\n exports.\n\n\n \"What's in the newspaper?\"\n he said, disinterestedly.\n\n\n \"Pogo and Albert are going\n to fight a duel,\" I told him, \"and\n Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll\n singer.\"\n\n\n He grunted.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said, \"the intellectual\n type.\" I scanned the front page.\n \"The Russkies have put up\n another manned satellite.\"\n\n\n \"They have, eh? How big?\"\n\n\n \"Several times bigger than\n anything we Americans have.\"\n\n\n The beer came and looked\n good, so I ordered a glass too.\n\n\n Paul said, \"What ever happened\n to those poxy flying\n saucers?\"\n\n\n \"What flying saucers?\"\n\n\n A French girl went by with a\n poodle so finely clipped as to look\n as though it'd been shaven. The\n girl was in the latest from\n Paris. Every pore in place. We\n both looked after her.\n\n\n \"You know, what everybody\n was seeing a few years ago. It's\n too bad one of these bloody manned\n satellites wasn't up then.\n Maybe they would've seen one.\"\n\n\n \"That's an idea,\" I said.\n\n\n We didn't say anything else for\n a while and I began to wonder\n if I could go back to my paper\n without rubbing him the wrong\n way. I didn't know Paul very\n well, but, for that matter, it's\n comparatively seldom you ever\n get to know anybody very well\n in Tangier. Largely, cards are\n played close to the chest.\nMy beer came and a plate of\n tapas for us both. Tapas at the\n Cafe de Paris are apt to be\n potato salad, a few anchovies,\n olives, and possibly some cheese.\n Free lunch, they used to call it\n in the States.\n\n\n Just to say something, I said,\n \"Where do you think they came\n from?\" And when he looked\n blank, I added, \"The Flying\n Saucers.\"\n\n\n He grinned. \"From Mars or\n Venus, or someplace.\"\n\n\n \"Ummmm,\" I said. \"Too bad\n none of them ever crashed, or\n landed on the Yale football field\n and said\nTake me to your cheerleader\n,\n or something.\"\n\n\n Paul yawned and said, \"That\n was always the trouble with those\n crackpot blokes' explanations of\n them. If they were aliens from\n space, then why not show themselves?\"\n\n\n I ate one of the potato chips.\n It'd been cooked in rancid olive\n oil.\n\n\n I said, \"Oh, there are various\n answers to that one. We could\n probably sit around here and\n think of two or three that made\n sense.\"\n\n\n Paul was mildly interested.\n \"Like what?\"\n\n\n \"Well, hell, suppose for instance\n there's this big Galactic League\n of civilized planets. But it's restricted,\n see. You're not eligible\n for membership until you, well,\n say until you've developed space\n flight. Then you're invited into\n the club. Meanwhile, they send\n secret missions down from time\n to time to keep an eye on your\n progress.\"\n\n\n Paul grinned at me. \"I see you\n read the same poxy stuff I do.\"\n\n\n A Moorish girl went by dressed\n in a neatly tailored gray\n jellaba, European style high-heeled\n shoes, and a pinkish silk\n veil so transparent that you\n could see she wore lipstick. Very\n provocative, dark eyes can be\n over a veil. We both looked\n after her.\n\n\n I said, \"Or, here's another\n one. Suppose you have a very\n advanced civilization on, say,\n Mars.\"\n\n\n \"Not Mars. No air, and too\n bloody dry to support life.\"\n\n\n \"Don't interrupt, please,\" I\n said with mock severity. \"This\n is a very old civilization and as\n the planet began to lose its\n water and air, it withdrew underground.\n Uses hydroponics and\n so forth, husbands its water and\n air. Isn't that what we'd do, in\n a few million years, if Earth lost\n its water and air?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so,\" he said. \"Anyway,\n what about them?\"\n\n\n \"Well, they observe how man\n is going through a scientific\n boom, an industrial boom, a\n population boom. A boom, period.\n Any day now he's going to have\n practical space ships. Meanwhile,\n he's also got the H-Bomb and\n the way he beats the drums on\n both sides of the Curtain, he's\n not against using it, if he could\n get away with it.\"\n\n\n Paul said, \"I got it. So they're\n scared and are keeping an eye on\n us. That's an old one. I've read\n that a dozen times, dished up\n different.\"\n\n\n I shifted my shoulders. \"Well,\n it's one possibility.\"\n\n\n \"I got a better one. How's\n this. There's this alien life form\n that's way ahead of us. Their\n civilization is so old that they\n don't have any records of when\n it began and how it was in the\n early days. They've gone beyond\n things like wars and depressions\n and revolutions, and greed for\n power or any of these things\n giving us a bad time here on\n Earth. They're all like scholars,\n get it? And some of them are\n pretty jolly well taken by Earth,\n especially the way we are right\n now, with all the problems, get\n it? Things developing so fast we\n don't know where we're going\n or how we're going to get there.\"\nI finished my beer and clapped\n my hands for Mouley. \"How do\n you mean,\nwhere we're going\n?\"\n\n\n \"Well, take half the countries\n in the world today. They're trying\n to industrialize, modernize,\n catch up with the advanced countries.\n Look at Egypt, and Israel,\n and India and China, and Yugoslavia\n and Brazil, and all the\n rest. Trying to drag themselves\n up to the level of the advanced\n countries, and all using different\n methods of doing it. But look\n at the so-called advanced countries.\n Up to their bottoms in\n problems. Juvenile delinquents,\n climbing crime and suicide rates,\n the loony-bins full of the balmy,\n unemployed, threat of war,\n spending all their money on armaments\n instead of things like\n schools. All the bloody mess of\n it. Why, a man from Mars would\n be fascinated, like.\"\n\n\n Mouley came shuffling up in\n his babouche slippers and we\n both ordered another schooner\n of beer.\n\n\n Paul said seriously, \"You\n know, there's only one big snag\n in this sort of talk. I've sorted\n the whole thing out before, and\n you always come up against this\n brick wall. Where are they, these\n observers, or scholars, or spies\n or whatever they are? Sooner\n or later we'd nab one of them.\n You know, Scotland Yard, or\n the F.B.I., or Russia's secret\n police, or the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, or\n Interpol. This world is so deep\n in police, counter-espionage outfits\n and security agents that an\n alien would slip up in time, no\n matter how much he'd been\n trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip\n up, and they'd nab him.\"\n\n\n I shook my head. \"Not necessarily.\n The first time I ever considered\n this possibility, it seemed\n to me that such an alien would\n base himself in London or New\n York. Somewhere where he could\n use the libraries for research,\n get the daily newspapers and\n the magazines. Be right in the\n center of things. But now I don't\n think so. I think he'd be right\n here in Tangier.\"\n\n\n \"Why Tangier?\"\n\n\n \"It's the one town in the world\n where anything goes. Nobody\n gives a damn about you or your\n affairs. For instance, I've known\n you a year or more now, and I\n haven't the slightest idea of how\n you make your living.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" Paul admitted.\n \"In this town you seldom even\n ask a man where's he's from. He\n can be British, a White Russian,\n a Basque or a Sikh and nobody\n could care less. Where are\nyou\nfrom, Rupert?\"\n\n\n \"California,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"No, you're not,\" he grinned.\n\n\n I was taken aback. \"What do\n you mean?\"\n\n\n \"I felt your mind probe back\n a few minutes ago when I was\n talking about Scotland Yard or\n the F.B.I. possibly flushing an\n alien. Telepathy is a sense not\n trained by the humanoids. If\n they had it, your job\u2014and mine\u2014would\n be considerably more\n difficult. Let's face it, in spite of\n these human bodies we're disguised\n in, neither of us is\n humanoid. Where are you really\n from, Rupert?\"\n\n\n \"Aldebaran,\" I said. \"How\n about you?\"\n\n\n \"Deneb,\" he told me, shaking.\n\n\n We had a laugh and ordered\n another beer.\n\n\n \"What're you doing here on\n Earth?\" I asked him.\n\n\n \"Researching for one of our\n meat trusts. We're protein\n eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered\n quite a delicacy. How\n about you?\"\n\n\n \"Scouting the place for thrill\n tourists. My job is to go around\n to these backward cultures and\n help stir up inter-tribal, or international,\n conflicts\u2014all according\n to how advanced they\n are. Then our tourists come in\u2014well\n shielded, of course\u2014and get\n their kicks watching it.\"\n\n\n Paul frowned. \"That sort of\n practice could spoil an awful\n lot of good meat.\"\nTHE END\nTranscriber's Note:\nThis etext was produced from\nAmazing Stories\nDecember 1960.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
