  "article": "The\nDwindling\nYears\nHe didn\u2019t expect to be last\u2014but\n neither did he anticipate\n the horror of being the first!\nBy LESTER DEL REY\nIllustrated by JOHNS\nNEARLY TWO hundred\n years of habit carried the\n chairman of Exodus Corporation\n through the morning ritual\n of crossing the executive\n floor. Giles made the expected\n comments, smiled the proper\n smiles and greeted his staff by\n the right names, but it was purely\n automatic. Somehow, thinking\n had grown difficult in the mornings\n recently.\nInside his private office, he\n dropped all pretense and slumped\n into the padding of his chair, gasping\n for breath and feeling his\n heart hammering in his chest.\n He\u2019d been a fool to come to work,\n he realized. But with the Procyon\n shuttle arriving yesterday, there\n was no telling what might turn\n up. Besides, that fool of a medicist\n had sworn the shot would\n cure any allergy or asthma.\nGiles heard his secretary come\n in, but it wasn\u2019t until the smell\n of the coffee reached his nose\n that he looked up. She handed\n him a filled cup and set the carafe\n down on the age-polished surface\n of the big desk. She watched\n solicitously as he drank.\n\u201cThat bad, Arthur?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cJust a little tired,\u201d he told\n her, refilling the cup. She\u2019d made\n the coffee stronger than usual\n and it seemed to cut through\n some of the thickness in his head.\n \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting old, Amanda.\u201d\nShe smiled dutifully at the\n time-worn joke, but he knew she\n wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d cycled to\n middle age four times in her\n job and she probably knew him\n better than he knew himself\u2014which\n wouldn\u2019t be hard, he\n thought. He\u2019d hardly recognized\n the stranger in the mirror as he\n tried to shave. His normal thinness\n had looked almost gaunt\n and there were hollows in his\n face and circles under his eyes.\n Even his hair had seemed thinner,\n though that, of course, was\n impossible.\n\u201cAnything urgent on the Procyon\n shuttle?\u201d he asked as she\n continue staring at him with worried\n eyes.\nSHE JERKED her gaze away\n guiltily and turned to the incoming\n basket. \u201cMostly drugs for\n experimenting. A personal letter\n for you, relayed from some place\n I never heard of. And one of the\n super-light missiles! They found\n it drifting half a light-year out\n and captured it. Jordan\u2019s got a\n report on it and he\u2019s going crazy.\n But if you don\u2019t feel well\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m all right!\u201d he told her\n sharply. Then he steadied himself\n and managed to smile. \u201cThanks\n for the coffee, Amanda.\u201d\nShe accepted dismissal reluctantly.\n When she was gone, he\n sat gazing at the report from Jordan\n at Research.\nFor eighty years now, they\u2019d\n been sending out the little ships\n that vanished at greater than the\n speed of light, equipped with\n every conceivable device to make\n them return automatically after\n taking pictures of wherever they\n arrived. So far, none had ever returned\n or been located. This was\n the first hope they\u2019d found that\n the century-long trips between\n stars in the ponderous shuttles\n might be ended and he should\n have been filled with excitement\n at Jordan\u2019s hasty preliminary report.\nHe leafed through it. The little\n ship apparently had been picked\n up by accident when it almost\n collided with a Sirius-local ship.\n Scientists there had puzzled over\n it, reset it and sent it back. The\n two white rats on it had still been\n alive.\nGiles dropped the report wearily\n and picked up the personal\n message that had come on the\n shuttle. He fingered the microstrip\n inside while he drank another\n coffee, and finally pulled\n out the microviewer. There were\n three frames to the message, he\n saw with some surprise.\nHe didn\u2019t need to see the signature\n on the first projection.\n Only his youngest son would have\n sent an elaborate tercentenary\n greeting verse\u2014one that would\n arrive ninety years too late! Harry\n had been born just before Earth\n passed the drastic birth limitation\n act and his mother had\n spoiled him. He\u2019d even tried to\n avoid the compulsory emigration\n draft and stay on with his mother.\n It had been the bitter quarrels\n over that which had finally\n broken Giles\u2019 fifth marriage.\nOddly enough, the message in\n the next frame showed none of\n that. Harry had nothing but\n praise for the solar system where\n he\u2019d been sent. He barely mentioned\n being married on the way\n or his dozen children, but filled\n most of the frame with glowing\n description and a plea for his\n father to join him there!\nGILES SNORTED and turned\n to the third frame, which\n showed a group picture of the\n family in some sort of vehicle,\n against the background of an alien\n but attractive world.\nHe had no desire to spend\n ninety years cooped up with a\n bunch of callow young emigrants,\n even in one of the improved Exodus\n shuttles. And even if Exodus\n ever got the super-light\n drive working, there was no reason\n he should give up his work.\n The discovery that men could\n live practically forever had put\n an end to most family ties; sentiment\n wore thin in half a century\u2014which\n wasn\u2019t much time\n now, though it had once seemed\n long enough.\nStrange how the years seemed\n to get shorter as their number increased.\n There\u2019d been a song\n once\u2014something about the years\n dwindling down. He groped for\n the lines and couldn\u2019t remember.\n Drat it! Now he\u2019d probably lie\n awake most of the night again,\n trying to recall them.\nThe outside line buzzed musically,\n flashing Research\u2019s number.\n Giles grunted in irritation. He\n wasn\u2019t ready to face Jordan yet.\n But he shrugged and pressed the\n button.\nThe intense face that looked\n from the screen was frowning as\n Jordan\u2019s eyes seemed to sweep\n around the room. He was still\n young\u2014one of the few under\n a hundred who\u2019d escaped deportation\n because of special ability\u2014and\n patience was still foreign to\n him.\nThen the frown vanished as\n an expression of shock replaced\n it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.\n If he looked\nthat\nbad\u2014\nBut Jordan wasn\u2019t looking at\n him; the man\u2019s interest lay in the\n projected picture from Harry, across\n the desk from the communicator.\n\u201cAntigravity!\u201d His voice was\n unbelieving as he turned his head\n to face the older man. \u201cWhat\n world is that?\u201d\nGiles forced his attention on\n the picture again and this time\n he noticed the vehicle shown. It\n was enough like an old model\n Earth conveyance to pass casual\n inspection, but it floated wheellessly\n above the ground. Faint\n blur lines indicated it had been\n moving when the picture was\n taken.\n\u201cOne of my sons\u2014\u201d Giles\n started to answer. \u201cI could find\n the star\u2019s designation....\u201d\nJordan cursed harshly. \u201cSo we\n can send a message on the shuttle,\n begging for their secret in a\n couple of hundred years! While\n a hundred other worlds make a\n thousand major discoveries they\n don\u2019t bother reporting! Can\u2019t the\n Council see\nanything\n?\u201d\nGiles had heard it all before.\n Earth was becoming a backwater\n world; no real progress had been\n made in two centuries; the young\n men were sent out as soon as\n their first fifty years of education\n were finished, and the older men\n were too conservative for really\n new thinking. There was a measure\n of truth in it, unfortunately.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll slow up when their\n populations fill,\u201d Giles repeated\n his old answers. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead\n in medicine and we\u2019ll get the\n other discoveries eventually, without\n interrupting the work of making\n the Earth fit for our longevity.\n We can wait. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d\nTHE YOUNGER man stared\n at him with the strange puzzled\n look Giles had seen too often\n lately. \u201cDamn it, haven\u2019t you read\n my report? We know the super-light\n drive works! That missile\n reached Sirius in less than ten\n days. We can have the secret of\n this antigravity in less than a\n year! We\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Giles felt the\n thickness pushing back at his\n mind and tried to fight it off. He\u2019d\n only skimmed the report, but this\n made no sense. \u201cYou mean you\n can calibrate your guiding devices\n accurately enough to get a\n missile where you want it and\n back?\u201d\n\u201c\nWhat?\n\u201d Jordan\u2019s voice rattled\n the speaker. \u201cOf course not! It\n took two accidents to get the\n thing back to us\u2014and with a\n half-light-year miss that delayed\n it about twenty years before the\n Procyon shuttle heard its signal.\n Pre-setting a course may take\n centuries, if we can ever master\n it. Even with Sirius expecting the\n missiles and ready to cooperate.\n I mean the big ship. We\u2019ve had it\n drafted for building long enough;\n now we can finish it in three\n months. We know the drive works.\n We know it\u2019s fast enough to reach\n Procyon in two weeks. We even\n know life can stand the trip. The\n rats were unharmed.\u201d\nGiles shook his head at what\n the other was proposing, only\n partly believing it. \u201cRats don\u2019t\n have minds that could show any\n real damage such as the loss of\n power to rejuvenate. We can\u2019t put\n human pilots into a ship with our\n drive until we\u2019ve tested it more\n thoroughly, Bill, even if they\n could correct for errors on arrival.\n Maybe if we put in stronger signaling\n transmitters....\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Maybe in two centuries\n we\u2019d have a through route charted\n to Sirius. And we still wouldn\u2019t\n have proved it safe for human\n pilots. Mr. Giles, we\u2019ve got to\n have the big ship. All we need is\none\nvolunteer!\u201d\nIt occurred to Giles then that\n the man had been too fired with\n the idea to think. He leaned back,\n shaking his head again wearily.\n \u201cAll right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.\n Or how about you? Do\n you really want to risk losing the\n rest of your life rather than waiting\n a couple more centuries until\n we know it\u2019s safe? If you do, I\u2019ll\n order the big ship.\u201d\nJordan opened his mouth and\n for a second Giles\u2019 heart caught\n in a flux of emotions as the\n man\u2019s offer hovered on his lips.\n Then the engineer shut his mouth\n slowly. The belligerence ran out\n of him.\nHe looked sick, for he had no\n answer.\nNO SANE man would risk a\n chance for near eternity\n against such a relatively short\n wait. Heroism had belonged to\n those who knew their days were\n numbered, anyhow.\n\u201cForget it, Bill,\u201d Giles advised.\n \u201cIt may take longer, but eventually\n we\u2019ll find a way. With time\n enough, we\u2019re bound to. And\n when we do, the ship will be\n ready.\u201d\nThe engineer nodded miserably\n and clicked off. Giles turned\n from the blank screen to stare\n out of the windows, while his\n hand came up to twist at the lock\n of hair over his forehead. Eternity!\n They had to plan and build\n for it. They couldn\u2019t risk that\n plan for short-term benefits. Usually\n it was too easy to realize that,\n and the sight of the solid, time-enduring\n buildings outside should\n have given him a sense of security.\nToday, though, nothing seemed\n to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\n somehow lost; the city beyond\n the window blurred as he\n studied it, and he swung the chair\n back so violently that his hand\n jerked painfully on the forelock\n he\u2019d been twisting.\nThen he was staring unbelievingly\n at the single white hair that\n was twisted with the dark ones\n between his fingers.\nLike an automaton, he bent\n forward, his other hand groping\n for the mirror that should be in\n one of the drawers. The dull pain\n in his chest sharpened and his\n breath was hoarse in his throat,\n but he hardly noticed as he found\n the mirror and brought it up. His\n eyes focused reluctantly. There\n were other white strands in his\n dark hair.\nThe mirror crashed to the floor\n as he staggered out of the office.\nIt was only two blocks to Giles\u2019\n residence club, but he had to\n stop twice to catch his breath\n and fight against the pain that\n clawed at his chest. When he\n reached the wood-paneled lobby,\n he was barely able to stand.\nDubbins was at his side almost\n at once, with a hand under\n his arm to guide him toward his\n suite.\n\u201cLet me help you, sir,\u201d Dubbins\n suggested, in the tones\n Giles hadn\u2019t heard since the man\n had been his valet, back when\n it was still possible to find personal\n servants. Now he managed\n the club on a level of quasi-equality\n with the members. For the\n moment, though, he\u2019d slipped\n back into the old ways.\nGILES FOUND himself lying\n on his couch, partially undressed,\n with the pillows just right\n and a long drink in his hand. The\n alcohol combined with the reaction\n from his panic to leave him\n almost himself again. After all,\n there was nothing to worry about;\n Earth\u2019s doctors could cure anything.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019d better call Dr.\n Vincenti,\u201d he decided. Vincenti\n was a member and would probably\n be the quickest to get.\nDubbins shook his head. \u201cDr.\n Vincenti isn\u2019t with us, sir. He\n left a year ago to visit a son in\n the Centauri system. There\u2019s a\n Dr. Cobb whose reputation is\n very good, sir.\u201d\nGiles puzzled over it doubtfully.\n Vincenti had been an oddly\n morose man the last few times\n he\u2019d seen him, but that could\n hardly explain his taking a twenty-year\n shuttle trip for such a\n slim reason. It was no concern of\n his, though. \u201cDr. Cobb, then,\u201d he\n said.\nGiles heard the other man\u2019s\n voice on the study phone, too low\n for the words to be distinguishable.\n He finished the drink, feeling\n still better, and was sitting\n up when Dubbins came back.\n\u201cDr. Cobb wants you to come\n to his office at once, sir,\u201d he said,\n dropping to his knee to help\n Giles with his shoes. \u201cI\u2019d be\n pleased to drive you there.\u201d\nGiles frowned. He\u2019d expected\n Cobb to come to him. Then he\n grimaced at his own thoughts.\n Dubbins\u2019 manners must have carried\n him back into the past; doctors\n didn\u2019t go in for home visits\n now\u2014they preferred to see their\n patients in the laboratories that\n housed their offices. If this kept\n on, he\u2019d be missing the old days\n when he\u2019d had a mansion and\n counted his wealth in possessions,\n instead of the treasures he could\n build inside himself for the future\n ahead. He was getting positively\n childish!\nYet he relished the feeling of\n having Dubbins drive his car.\n More than anything else, he\u2019d\n loved being driven. Even after\n chauffeurs were a thing of the\n past, Harry had driven him\n around. Now he\u2019d taken to walking,\n as so many others had, for\n even with modern safety measures\n so strict, there was always\n a small chance of some accident\n and nobody had any desire to\n spend the long future as a cripple.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, sir,\u201d Dubbins\n offered as they stopped beside\n the low, massive medical building.\nIt was almost too much consideration.\n Giles nodded, got out\n and headed down the hall uncertainly.\n Just how bad did he\n look? Well, he\u2019d soon find out.\nHe located the directory and\n finally found the right office, its\n reception room wall covered\n with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had\n picked up in some three hundred\n years of practice. Giles felt\n better, realizing it wouldn\u2019t be\n one of the younger men.\nCOBB APPEARED himself,\n before the nurse could take\n over, and led Giles into a room\n with an old-fashioned desk and\n chairs that almost concealed the\n cabinets of equipment beyond.\nHe listened as Giles stumbled\n out his story. Halfway through,\n the nurse took a blood sample\n with one of the little mosquito\n needles and the machinery behind\n the doctor began working on\n it.\n\u201cYour friend told me about the\n gray hair, of course,\u201d Cobb said.\n At Giles\u2019 look, he smiled faintly.\n \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t think people\n could miss that in this day and\n age? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d\nHe inspected it and began\n making tests. Some were older\n than Giles could remember\u2014knee\n reflex, blood pressure, pulse\n and fluoroscope. Others involved\n complicated little gadgets that\n ran over his body, while meters\n bobbed and wiggled. The blood\n check came through and Cobb\n studied it, to go back and make\n further inspections of his own.\nAt last he nodded slowly.\n \u201cHyper-catabolism, of course. I\n thought it might be. How long\n since you had your last rejuvenation?\n And who gave it?\u201d\n\u201cAbout ten years ago,\u201d Giles\n answered. He found his identity\n card and passed it over, while\n the doctor studied it. \u201cMy sixteenth.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t going right. He could\n feel it. Some of the panic symptoms\n were returning; the pulse in\n his neck was pounding and his\n breath was growing difficult.\n Sweat ran down his sides from\n his armpit and he wiped his palms\n against his coat.\n\u201cAny particular emotional\n strain when you were treated\u2014some\n major upset in your life?\u201d\n Cobb asked.\nGiles thought as carefully as\n he could, but he remembered\n nothing like that. \u201cYou mean\u2014it\n didn\u2019t take? But I never had\n any trouble, Doctor. I was one of\n the first million cases, when a\n lot of people couldn\u2019t rejuvenate\n at all, and I had no trouble even\n then.\u201d\nCobb considered it, hesitated as\n if making up his mind to be frank\n against his better judgment. \u201cI\n can\u2019t see any other explanation.\n You\u2019ve got a slight case of angina\u2014nothing\n serious, but quite definite\u2014as\n well as other signs\n of aging. I\u2019m afraid the treatment\n didn\u2019t take fully. It might have\n been some unconscious block\n on your part, some infection not\n diagnosed at the time, or even a\n fault in the treatment. That\u2019s\n pretty rare, but we can\u2019t neglect\n the possibility.\u201d\nHE STUDIED his charts again\n and then smiled. \u201cSo we\u2019ll\n give you another treatment. Any\n reason you can\u2019t begin immediately?\u201d\nGiles remembered that Dubbins\n was waiting for him, but this\n was more important. It hadn\u2019t\n been a joke about his growing old,\n after all. But now, in a few days,\n he\u2019d be his old\u2014no, of course\n not\u2014his young self again!\nThey went down the hall to\n another office, where Giles waited\n outside while Cobb conferred\n with another doctor and technician,\n with much waving of charts.\n He resented every second of it.\n It was as if the almost forgotten\n specter of age stood beside him,\n counting the seconds. But at last\n they were through and he was led\n into the quiet rejuvenation room,\n where the clamps were adjusted\n about his head and the earpieces\n were fitted. The drugs were shot\n painlessly into his arm and the\n light-pulser was adjusted to his\n brain-wave pattern.\nIt had been nothing like this his\n first time. Then it had required\n months of mental training, followed\n by crude mechanical and\n drug hypnosis for other months.\n Somewhere in every human brain\n lay the memory of what his cells\n had been like when he was young.\n Or perhaps it lay in the cells\n themselves, with the brain as only\n a linkage to it. They\u2019d discovered\n that, and the fact that the mind\n could effect physical changes in\n the body. Even such things as\n cancer could be willed out of existence\u2014provided\n the brain\n could be reached far below the\n conscious level and forced to\n operate.\nThere had been impossible\n faith cures for millenia\u2014cataracts\n removed from blinded eyes\n within minutes, even\u2014but finding\n the mechanism in the brain\n that worked those miracles had\n taken an incredible amount of\n study and finding a means of\n bringing it under control had\n taken even longer.\nNow they did it with dozens of\n mechanical aids in addition to\n the hypnotic instructions\u2014and\n did it usually in a single sitting,\n with the full transformation of\n the body taking less than a week\n after the treatment!\nBut with all the equipment, it\n wasn\u2019t impossible for a mistake\n to happen. It had been no fault of\n his ... he was sure of that ... his\n mind was easy to reach ... he\n could relax so easily....\nHe came out of it without\n even a headache, while they were\n removing the probes, but the\n fatigue on the operator\u2019s face told\n him it had been a long and difficult\n job. He stretched experimentally,\n with the eternal unconscious\n expectation that he would\n find himself suddenly young\n again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.\n It took days for the mind\n to work on all the cells and to\n repair the damage of time.\nCOBB LED him back to the\n first office, where he was given\n an injection of some kind and\n another sample of his blood was\n taken, while the earlier tests were\n repeated. But finally the doctor\n nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all for now, Mr. Giles.\n You might drop in tomorrow\n morning, after I\u2019ve had a chance\n to complete my study of all this.\n We\u2019ll know by then whether you\u2019ll\n need more treatment. Ten o\u2019clock\n okay?\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll be all right?\u201d\nCobb smiled the automatic reassurance\n of his profession. \u201cWe\n haven\u2019t lost a patient in two hundred\n years, to my knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Giles. \u201cTen\n o\u2019clock is fine.\u201d\nDubbins was still waiting, reading\n a paper whose headlined feature\n carried a glowing account of\n the discovery of the super-light\n missile and what it might mean.\n He took a quick look at Giles and\n pointed to it. \u201cGreat work, Mr.\n Giles. Maybe we\u2019ll all get to see\n some of those other worlds yet.\u201d\n Then he studied Giles more carefully.\n \u201cEverything\u2019s in good shape\n now, sir?\u201d\n\u201cThe doctor says everything\u2019s\n going to be fine,\u201d Giles answered.\nIt was then he realized for the\n first time that Cobb had said no\n such thing. A statement that\n lightning had never struck a\n house was no guarantee that it\n never would. It was an evasion\n meant to give such an impression.\nThe worry nagged at him all\n the way back. Word had already\n gone around the club that he\u2019d\n had some kind of attack and\n there were endless questions that\n kept it on his mind. And even\n when it had been covered and\n recovered, he could still sense the\n glances of the others, as if he\n were Vincenti in one of the man\u2019s\n more morose moods.\nHe found a single table in the\n dining room and picked his way\n through the meal, listening to\n the conversation about him only\n when it was necessary because\n someone called across to him.\n Ordinarily, he was quick to support\n the idea of clubs in place\n of private families. A man here\n could choose his group and grow\n into them. Yet he wasn\u2019t swallowed\n by them, as he might be by\n a family. Giles had been living\n here for nearly a century now and\n he\u2019d never regretted it. But tonight\n his own group irritated him.\nHe puzzled over it, finding no\n real reason. Certainly they weren\u2019t\n forcing themselves on him. He\n remembered once when he\u2019d had\n a cold, before they finally licked\n that; Harry had been a complete\n nuisance, running around with\n various nostrums, giving him no\n peace. Constant questions about\n how he felt, constant little looks\n of worry\u2014until he\u2019d been ready\n to yell at the boy. In fact, he\n had.\nFunny, he couldn\u2019t picture really\n losing his temper here. Families\n did odd things to a man.\nHE LISTENED to a few of\n the discussions after the dinner,\n but he\u2019d heard them all before,\n except for one about the\n super-speed drive, and there he\n had no wish to talk until he could\n study the final report. He gave up\n at last and went to his own suite.\n What he needed was a good\n night\u2019s sleep after a little relaxation.\nEven that failed him, though.\n He\u2019d developed one of the finest\n chess collections in the world, but\n tonight it held no interest. And\n when he drew out his tools and\n tried working on the delicate,\n lovely jade for the set he was\n carving his hands seemed to be\n all thumbs. None of the other interests\n he\u2019d developed through\n the years helped to add to the\n richness of living now.\nHe gave it up and went to bed\u2014to\n have the fragment of that\n song pop into his head. Now there\n was no escaping it. Something\n about the years\u2014or was it days\u2014dwindling\n down to something\n or other.\nCould they really dwindle\n down? Suppose he couldn\u2019t rejuvenate\n all the way? He knew\n that there were some people who\n didn\u2019t respond as well as others.\n Sol Graves, for instance. He\u2019d\n been fifty when he finally learned\n how to work with the doctors and\n they could only bring him back to\n about thirty, instead of the normal\n early twenties. Would that\n reduce the slice of eternity that\n rejuvenation meant? And what\n had happened to Sol?\nOr suppose it wasn\u2019t rejuvenation,\n after all; suppose something\n had gone wrong with him\n permanently?\nHe fought that off, but he\n couldn\u2019t escape the nagging\n doubts at the doctor\u2019s words.\nHe got up once to stare at himself\n in the mirror. Ten hours had\n gone by and there should have\n been some signs of improvement.\n He couldn\u2019t be sure, though,\n whether there were or not.\nHe looked no better the next\n morning when he finally dragged\n himself up from the little sleep\n he\u2019d managed to get. The hollows\n were still there and the circles\n under his eyes. He searched for\n the gray in his hair, but the traitorous\n strands had been removed\n at the doctor\u2019s office and he could\n find no new ones.\nHe looked into the dining room\n and then went by hastily. He\n wanted no solicitous glances this\n morning. Drat it, maybe he\n should move out. Maybe trying\n family life again would give him\n some new interests. Amanda probably\n would be willing to marry\n him; she\u2019d hinted at a date once.\nHe stopped, shocked by the\n awareness that he hadn\u2019t been out\n with a woman for....\nHe couldn\u2019t remember how\n long it had been. Nor why.\n\u201cIn the spring, a young man\u2019s\n fancy,\u201d he quoted to himself, and\n then shuddered.\nIt hadn\u2019t been that kind of\n spring for him\u2014not this rejuvenation\n nor the last, nor the one\n before that.\nGILES TRIED to stop scaring\n himself and partially succeeded,\n until he reached the doctor\u2019s\n office. Then it was no longer necessary\n to frighten himself. The\n wrongness was too strong, no matter\n how professional Cobb\u2019s smile!\nHe didn\u2019t hear the preliminary\n words. He watched the smile vanish\n as the stack of reports came\n out. There was no nurse here\n now. The machines were quiet\u2014and\n all the doors were shut.\nGiles shook his head, interrupting\n the doctor\u2019s technical jargon.\n Now that he knew there was reason\n for his fear, it seemed to\n vanish, leaving a coldness that\n numbed him.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather know the whole\n truth,\u201d he said. His voice sounded\n dead in his ears. \u201cThe worst first.\n The rejuvenation...?\u201d\nCobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.\n \u201cFailed.\u201d He stopped, and\n his hands touched the reports on\n his desk. \u201cCompletely,\u201d he added\n in a low, defeated tone.\n\u201cBut I thought that was impossible!\u201d\n\u201cSo did I. I wouldn\u2019t believe\n it even yet\u2014but now I find it\n isn\u2019t the first case. I spent the\n night at Medical Center going up\n the ranks until I found men who\n really know about it. And now I\n wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d His voice ran\n down and he gathered himself together\n by an effort. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock\n to me, too, Mr. Giles. But\u2014well,\n to simplify it, no memory is perfect\u2014even\n cellular memory. It\n loses a little each time. And the\n effect is cumulative. It\u2019s like an\n asymptotic curve\u2014the further it\n goes, the steeper the curve. And\u2014well,\n you\u2019ve passed too far.\u201d\nHe faced away from Giles,\n dropping the reports into a\n drawer and locking it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\n supposed to tell you, of course.\n It\u2019s going to be tough enough\n when they\u2019re ready to let people\n know. But you aren\u2019t the first and\n you won\u2019t be the last, if that\u2019s any\n consolation. We\u2019ve got a longer\n time scale than we used to have\u2014but\n it\u2019s in centuries, not in\n eons. For everybody, not just\n you.\u201d\nIt was no consolation. Giles\n nodded mechanically. \u201cI won\u2019t\n talk, of course. How\u2014how long?\u201d\nCobb spread his hands unhappily.\n \u201cThirty years, maybe. But\n we can make them better. Geriatric\n knowledge is still on record.\n We can fix the heart and all the\n rest. You\u2019ll be in good physical\n condition, better than your grandfather\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd then....\u201d Giles couldn\u2019t\n pronounce the words. He\u2019d grown\n old and he\u2019d grow older. And\n eventually he\u2019d die!\nAn immortal man had suddenly\n found death hovering on his\n trail. The years had dwindled and\n gone, and only a few were left.\nHe stood up, holding out his\n hand. \u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d he\n said, and was surprised to find\n he meant it. The man had done\n all he could and had at least\n saved him the suspense of growing\n doubt and horrible eventual\n discovery.\nOUTSIDE ON the street, he\n looked up at the Sun and\n then at the buildings built to last\n for thousands of years. Their\n eternity was no longer a part of\n him.\nEven his car would outlast him.\nHe climbed into it, still partly\n numbed, and began driving mechanically,\n no longer wondering\n about the dangers that might possibly\n arise. Those wouldn\u2019t matter\n much now. For a man who\n had thought of living almost forever,\n thirty years was too short\n a time to count.\nHe was passing near the club\n and started to slow. Then he\n went on without stopping. He\n wanted no chance to have them\n asking questions he couldn\u2019t answer.\n It was none of their business.\n Dubbins had been kind\u2014but\n now Giles wanted no kindness.\nThe street led to the office\n and he drove on. What else was\n there for him? There, at least, he\n could still fill his time with work\u2014work\n that might even be useful.\n In the future, men would\n need the super-light drive if they\n were to span much more of the\n Universe than now. And he could\n speed up the work in some ways\n still, even if he could never see\n its finish.\nIt would be cold comfort but it\n was something. And he might\n keep busy enough to forget sometimes\n that the years were gone\n for him.\nAutomatic habit carried him\n through the office again, to Amanda\u2019s\n desk, where her worry was\n still riding her. He managed a\n grin and somehow the right words\n came to his lips. \u201cI saw the doctor,\n Amanda, so you can stop\n figuring ways to get me there.\u201d\nShe smiled back suddenly, without\n feigning it. \u201cThen you\u2019re all\n right?\u201d\n\u201cAs all right as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d\n he told her. \u201cThey tell me I\u2019m just\n growing old.\u201d\nThis time her laugh was heartier.\n He caught himself before he\n could echo her mirth in a different\n voice and went inside where she\n had the coffee waiting for him.\nOddly, it still tasted good to\n him.\nThe projection was off, he saw,\n wondering whether he\u2019d left it on\n or not. He snapped the switch and\n saw the screen light up, with the\n people still in the odd, wheelless\n vehicle on the alien planet.\nFOR A long moment, he stared\n at the picture without thinking,\n and then bent closer. Harry\u2019s\n face hadn\u2019t changed much. Giles\n had almost forgotten it, but there\n was still the same grin there. And\n his grandchildren had a touch\n of it, too. And of their grandfather\u2019s\n nose, he thought. Funny,\n he\u2019d never seen even pictures of\n his other grandchildren. Family\n ties melted away too fast for interstellar\n travel.\nYet there seemed to be no\n slackening of them in Harry\u2019s\n case, and somehow it looked like\n a family, rather than a mere\n group. A very pleasant family in\n a very pleasant world.\nHe read Harry\u2019s note again,\n with its praise for the planet and\n its invitation. He wondered if\n Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation\n like that, before he left.\n Or had he even been one of those\n to whom the same report had\n been delivered by some doctor?\n It didn\u2019t matter, but it would explain\n things, at least.\nTwenty years to Centaurus,\n while the years dwindled down\u2014\nThen abruptly the line finished\n itself. \u201cThe years dwindle down\n to a precious few....\u201d he remembered.\n \u201cA precious few.\u201d\nThose dwindling years had\n been precious once. He unexpectedly\n recalled his own grandfather\n holding him on an old\n knee and slipping him candy\n that was forbidden. The years\n seemed precious to the old man\n then.\nAmanda\u2019s voice came abruptly\n over the intercom. \u201cJordan wants\n to talk to you,\u201d she said, and the\n irritation was sharp in her voice.\n \u201cHe won\u2019t take no!\u201d\nGiles shrugged and reached for\n the projector, to cut it off. Then,\n on impulse, he set it back to the\n picture, studying the group again\n as he switched on Jordan\u2019s wire.\nBut he didn\u2019t wait for the hot\n words about whatever was the\n trouble.\n\u201cBill,\u201d he said, \u201cstart getting\n the big ship into production. I\u2019ve\n found a volunteer.\u201d\nHe\u2019d been driven to it, he knew,\n as he watched the man\u2019s amazed\n face snap from the screen. From\n the first suspicion of his trouble,\n something inside him had been\n forcing him to make this decision.\n And maybe it would do no good.\n Maybe the ship would fail. But\n thirty years was a number a man\n could risk.\nIf he made it, though....\nWell, he\u2019d see those grandchildren\n of his this year\u2014and\n Harry. Maybe he\u2019d even tell\n Harry the truth, once they got\n done celebrating the reunion. And\n there\u2019d be other grandchildren.\n With the ship, he\u2019d have time\n enough to look them up. Plenty\n of time!\nThirty years was a long time,\n when he stopped to think of it.\n\u2014LESTER DEL REY\n",
