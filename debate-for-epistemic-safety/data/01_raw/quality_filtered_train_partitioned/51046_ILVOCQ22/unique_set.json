  "article": "... and it comes out here\nBy LESTER DEL REY\n\n\n Illustrated by DON SIBLEY\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction February 1951.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nThere is one fact no sane man can quarrel\n\n with ... everything has a beginning and an end.\n\n But some men aren't sane; thus it isn't always so!\nNo, you're wrong. I'm not your father's ghost, even if I do look a bit\n like him. But it's a longish story, and you might as well let me in.\n You will, you know, so why quibble about it? At least, you always\n have ... or do ... or will. I don't know, verbs get all mixed up. We\n don't have the right attitude toward tenses for a situation like this.\n\n\n Anyhow, you'll let me in. I did, so you will.\n\n\n Thanks. You think you're crazy, of course, but you'll find out you\n aren't. It's just that things are a bit confused. And don't look at the\n machine out there too long\u2014until you get used to it, you'll find it's\n hard on the eyes, trying to follow where the vanes go. You'll get used\n to it, of course, but it will take about thirty years.\n\n\n You're wondering whether to give me a drink, as I remember it. Why not?\n And naturally, since we have the same tastes, you can make the same for\n me as you're having. Of course we have the same tastes\u2014we're the same\n person. I'm you thirty years from now, or you're me. I remember just\n how you feel; I felt the same way when he\u2014that is, of course, I or\n we\u2014came back to tell me about it, thirty years ago.\n\n\n Here, have one of these. You'll get to like them in a couple more\n years. And you can look at the revenue stamp date, if you still doubt\n my story. You'll believe it eventually, though, so it doesn't matter.\n\n\n Right now, you're shocked. It's a real wrench when a man meets himself\n for the first time. Some kind of telepathy seems to work between two\n of the same people. You\nsense\nthings. So I'll simply go ahead talking\n for half an hour or so, until you get over it. After that you'll come\n along with me. You know, I could try to change things around by telling\n what happened to me; but he\u2014I\u2014told me what I was going to do, so I\n might as well do the same. I probably couldn't help telling you the\n same thing in the same words, even if I tried\u2014and I don't intend to\n try. I've gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.\n\n\n So let's begin when you get up in half an hour and come out with me.\n You'll take a closer look at the machine, then. Yes, it'll be pretty\n obvious it must be a time machine. You'll sense that, too. You've seen\n it, just a small little cage with two seats, a luggage compartment, and\n a few buttons on a dash. You'll be puzzling over what I'll tell you,\n and you'll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes\n atomic power practical. Jerome Boell, just a plain engineer, the man\n who put atomic power in every home. You won't exactly believe it, but\n you'll want to go along.\nI'll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going. So I\n cut off your questions, and get you inside. I snap on a green button,\n and everything seems to cut off around us. You can see a sort of\n foggy nothing surrounding the cockpit; it is probably the field that\n prevents passage through time from affecting us. The luggage section\n isn't protected, though.\nYou start to say something, but by then I'm pressing a black button,\n and everything outside will disappear. You look for your house, but\n it isn't there. There is exactly nothing there\u2014in fact, there is no\nthere\n. You are completely outside of time and space, as best you can\n guess how things are.\n\n\n You can't feel any motion, of course. You try to reach a hand out\n through the field into the nothing around you and your hand goes out,\n all right, but nothing happens. Where the screen ends, your hand just\n turns over and pokes back at you. Doesn't hurt, and when you pull your\n arm back, you're still sound and uninjured. But it looks frightening\n and you don't try it again.\n\n\n Then it comes to you slowly that you're actually traveling in time.\n You turn to me, getting used to the idea. \"So this is the fourth\n dimension?\" you ask.\n\n\n Then you feel silly, because you'll remember that I said you'd ask\n that. Well, I asked it after I was told, then I came back and told it\n to you, and I still can't help answering when you speak.\n\n\n \"Not exactly,\" I try to explain. \"Maybe it's no dimension\u2014or it might\n be the fifth; if you're going to skip over the so-called fourth without\n traveling along it, you'd need a fifth. Don't ask me. I didn't invent\n the machine and I don't understand it.\"\n\n\n \"But....\"\n\n\n I let it go, and so do you. If you don't, it's a good way of going\n crazy. You'll see later why I couldn't have invented the machine. Of\n course, there may have been a start for all this once. There may have\n been a time when you did invent the machine\u2014the atomic motor first,\n then the time-machine. And when you closed the loop by going back and\n saving yourself the trouble, it got all tangled up. I figured out once\n that such a universe would need some seven or eight time and space\n dimensions. It's simpler just to figure that this is the way time got\n bent back on itself. Maybe there is no machine, and it's just easier\n for us to imagine it. When you spend thirty years thinking about it, as\n I did\u2014and you will\u2014you get further and further from an answer.\n\n\n Anyhow, you sit there, watching nothing all around you, and no time,\n apparently, though there is a time effect back in the luggage space.\n You look at your watch and it's still running. That means you either\n carry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small\n increment of time from the main field. I don't know, and you won't\n think about that then, either.\nI'm smoking, and so are you, and the air in the machine is getting a\n bit stale. You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide\n open, yet you haven't seen any effects of air loss.\n\n\n \"Where are we getting our air?\" you ask. \"Or why don't we lose it?\"\n\n\n \"No place for it to go,\" I explain. There isn't. Out there is neither\n time nor space, apparently. How could the air leak out? You still feel\n gravity, but I can't explain that, either. Maybe the machine has a\n gravity field built in, or maybe the time that makes your watch run is\n responsible for gravity. In spite of Einstein, you have always had the\n idea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.\n\n\n Then the machine stops\u2014at least, the field around us cuts off. You\n feel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe\n easier, though we're in complete darkness, except for the weak light in\n the machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement\n floor around. You take another cigaret from me and you get out of the\n machine, just as I do.\n\n\n I've got a bundle of clothes and I start changing. It's a sort\n of simple, short-limbed, one-piece affair I put on, but it feels\n comfortable.\n\n\n \"I'm staying here,\" I tell you. \"This is like the things they wear in\n this century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to\n pass fairly well. I've had all my fortune\u2014the one you make on that\n atomic generator\u2014invested in such a way I can get it on using some\n identification I've got with me, so I'll do all right. I know they\n still use some kind of money, you'll see evidence of that. And it's a\n pretty easygoing civilization, from what I could see. We'll go up and\n I'll leave you. I like the looks of things here, so I won't be coming\n back with you.\"\n\n\n You nod, remembering I've told you about it. \"What century is this,\n anyway?\"\n\n\n I'd told you that, too, but you've forgotten. \"As near as I can guess,\n it's about 2150. He told me, just as I'm telling you, that it's an\n interstellar civilization.\"\n\n\n You take another cigaret from me, and follow me. I've got a small\n flashlight and we grope through a pile of rubbish, out into a corridor.\n This is a sub-sub-sub-basement. We have to walk up a flight of stairs,\n and there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.\n\n\n \"What about the time machine?\" you ask.\n\n\n \"Since nobody ever stole it, it's safe.\"\nWe get in the elevator, and I say \"first\" to it. It gives out a\n coughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us. There's\n no feeling of acceleration\u2014some kind of false gravity they use in the\n future. Then the door opens, and the elevator says \"first\" back at us.\n\n\n It's obviously a service elevator and we're in a dim corridor, with\n nobody around. I grab your hand and shake it. \"You go that way. Don't\n worry about getting lost; you never did, so you can't. Find the museum,\n grab the motor, and get out. And good luck to you.\"\n\n\n You act as if you're dreaming, though you can't believe it's a dream.\n You nod at me and I move out into the main corridor. A second later,\n you see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward\n a restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening. I'm asking\n questions of a man, who points, and I turn and move off.\n\n\n You come out of the side corridor and go down a hall, away from the\n restaurant. There are quiet little signs along the hall. You look at\n them, realizing for the first time that things have changed.\nSteij:neri, Faunten, Z:rgat Dispenseri.\nThe signs are very quiet and\n dignified. Some of them can be decoded to stationery shops, fountains,\n and the like. What a zergot is, you don't know. You stop at a sign\n that announces:\nTrav:l Biwrou\u2014F:rst-Clas Twrz\u2014Marz, Viin*s, and\n x: Trouj:n Planets. Spej:l reits tu aol s*nz wixin 60 lyt iirz!\nBut\n there is only a single picture of a dull-looking metal sphere, with\n passengers moving up a ramp, and the office is closed. You begin to get\n the hang of the spelling they use, though.\n\n\n Now there are people around you, but nobody pays much attention to you.\n Why should they? You wouldn't care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin\n suit; you'd figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well,\n people don't change much.\n\n\n You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might\n be papers on tapes.\n\n\n \"Where can I find the Museum of Science?\"\n\n\n \"Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,\" he tells you. Around\n you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using\n stuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don't know.\n\n\n You go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface\n of the walk:\nMiuzi:m *v Syens\n. There's an arrow pointing and you turn\n left. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with\n faint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building\n lower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the\n maximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the\n information that it is the museum.\nYou go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You\n hesitate for a moment, then. You're beginning to think the whole affair\n is complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and\n go home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs\n in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other\n guard.\n\n\n What's more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort\n of drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it's rather\n pleasant.\n\n\n \"Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in 'Atoms and\n Axioms.' The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study\n whatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce\n guards as polite as that. \"I\u2014I'm told I should investigate your\n display of atomic generators.\"\n\n\n He beams at that. \"Of course.\" The gate is swung to behind you, but\n obviously he isn't locking it. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a\n lock. \"Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight\n of stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We've got\n the original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using\n them to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could\n not explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though.\n Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It's quite a\n hobby with me, sir. I've read everything I could get on the period.\n Oh\u2014congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our\n oldest tapes.\"\n\n\n You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building\n seems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There's a room on your\n right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly\n plastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it\n goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row\n of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny\n toward you.\n\n\n \"Souvenir,\" it announces in a well-modulated voice. \"This is a typical\n gem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known\n technically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats\n in size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during\n morning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child,\n press the red button for the number of stones you desire.\"\n\n\n You put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the\n corridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of\n spaceships\u2014from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is\n labeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with\n miniature manikins\u2014are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then\n there is one labeled\nWep:nz\n, filled with everything from a crossbow\n to a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil,\n marked\nFynal Hand Arm\n. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big\n place that bears a sign,\nMad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez\n.\nBy that time, you're almost convinced. And you've been doing a lot of\n thinking about what you can do. The story I'm telling has been sinking\n in, but you aren't completely willing to accept it.\n\n\n You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a\n lot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order,\n and the latest one, marked\n2147\u2014Rincs Dyn*pat:\n, is about the size\n of a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier,\n but with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign\n on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining\n that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically\n final form.\n\n\n You study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving\n his name. Either they don't know it, or they take it for granted that\n everyone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the\n fact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator\n built, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation,\n and full patent application.\n\n\n They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel,\n producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any\n chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles,\n and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being\n fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the\n outputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being\n investigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the\n addition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added\n since the original.\n\n\n So you go to the end and look over the thing. It's simply a square box\n with a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top,\n plus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling,\nDrop BBs or wire\n here\n. Apparently that's the way it's fueled. It's about one foot on\n each side.\n\n\n \"Nice,\" the guard says over your shoulder. \"It finally wore out one of\n the cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it's exactly\n as the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever.\n Like to have me tell you about it?\"\n\n\n \"Not particularly,\" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be\n conspicuous here. While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls\n something out of his pocket and stares at it.\n\n\n \"Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba\u2014Centaurian, you know\u2014is\n arriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine\n some of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared\n to nineteenth century man. You'll pardon me?\"\n\n\n You pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up\n to the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it\n transliterates to. That's small and you can carry it. But the darned\n thing is absolutely fixed. You can't see any bolts, but you can't budge\n it, either.\nYou work down the line. It'd be foolish to take the early model if you\n can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals\u2014Ehrenhaft or\n some other principle?\u2014and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But\n they're all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.\n\n\n And, finally, you're right back beside the original first model. It's\n probably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it\n moves. There's a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn't touch\n it, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.\n\n\n Well, you won't be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I\n haven't told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing.\n You lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be\n carried.\n\n\n You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact,\n if you'd stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time\n machine out there now, you'd hear what I'm saying and know what will\n happen to you. But of course, just as I did, you're going to miss a\n lot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But\n maybe some of it helps. I've tried to remember how much I remembered,\n after he told me, but I can't be sure. So I'll keep on talking. I\n probably can't help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.\n\n\n Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all\n seems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend\n down and try to scurry past, but you know you're in full view. Nothing\n happens, though.\n\n\n You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the\n world on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate\n is closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe\n a quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.\n\n\n Then there's a yell behind you. You don't wait. You put one leg in\n front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past\n people, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see.\n There's another yell behind you.\n\n\n Something goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front\n of your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don't wait to find out\n about that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you\n dart past.\nThe street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms\n seeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting\n heavier at every step.\n\n\n Out of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and\n on the beefy side appears\u2014and the badge hasn't changed much. The cop\n catches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.\n\n\n \"You can't exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,\" the cop\n says. \"There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let\n me grab you a taxi.\"\nReaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake\n your head and come up for air.\n\n\n \"I\u2014I left my money home,\" you begin.\n\n\n The cop nods. \"Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won't have to give you\n an appearance schedule. But you should have come to me.\" He reaches\n out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. \"Sir, an emergency\n request. Would you help this gentleman?\"\nThe pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. \"How far?\"\n\n\n You did notice the name of the building from which you came and you\n mutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other\n side of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him.\n Pedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the\n street at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming\n at you both.\n\n\n That way, it isn't so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might\n like to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation\n here doesn't look too good. The guard can get the same and be there\n before you.\n\n\n And he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach\n it. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod\n at him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some\n dinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too\n dissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.\n\n\n \"You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,\" he says.\n \"They go with the generator\u2014we don't like to have them separated. A\n good thing I knew the production office of 'Atoms and Axioms' was in\n this building. Just let us know when you're finished with the model and\n we'll pick it up.\"\n\n\n You swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and\n take the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps\n you for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems\n to satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction\n and heads back to the museum.\n\n\n You still don't believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and\n the information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator.\n There is no button on it. In fact, there's no door there.\n\n\n You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is\n right. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.\nThen there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It\n forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in,\n gulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how\n a machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What\n the deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has\n closed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you're at\n the original level. You get out\u2014and realize you don't have a light.\n\n\n You'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back\n in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering\n here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then\n a shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.\n\n\n You've located it.\n\n\n You put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers\n down beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You\n reach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There's a red one\n beside it and you finally decide on that.\n\n\n Suddenly, there's a confused yell from the direction of the elevator\n and a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating\n it. Your finger touches the red button.\n\n\n You'll never know what the shouting was about\u2014whether they finally\n doped out the fact that they'd been robbed, or whether they were trying\n to help you. You don't care which it is. The field springs up around\n you and the next button you touch\u2014the one on the board that hasn't\n been used so far\u2014sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of\n light, you can't hear a thing, and you're safe.\n\n\n It isn't much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your\n nerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with\n some pencil marks over them\u2014\"Press these to return to yourself 30\n years\"\u2014and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn't\n because there is only one of you this time.\n\n\n Instead, everything flashes off and you're sitting in the machine in\n your own back yard.\n\n\n You'll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the\n machine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement,\n land in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up\n yourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then,\n you don't care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic\n generator and taking it inside.\nIt isn't hard to disassemble, but you don't learn a thing; just some\n plates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends\u2014all\n things that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals.\n But when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice\n something.\n\n\n Everything in it is brand-new and there's one set of copper wires\n missing! It won't work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like\n the set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.\n\n\n And with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you\n get just that. You don't need the power company any more. And you\n feel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn't\n insulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward\n in time, somehow, and is back to its original youth\u2014minus the\n replaced wires the guard mentioned\u2014which probably wore out because of\n the makeshift job you've just done.\n\n\n But you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are\n all in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and\n that the date of the patent application is 1951.\n\n\n It will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the\n future and bring it back to the past\u2014your present\u2014so that it can be\n put in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be\n the inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to\n yourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to\n yourself....\n\n\n Who invented what? And who built which?\n\n\n Before long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little\n kids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed\n history and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to\n be anything but a democracy and a peaceful one\u2014after some of the\n worst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as\n common as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital\n letter.\n\n\n But you're thinking of the puzzle. You can't find any answer.\n\n\n One day you come across an old poem\u2014something about some folks\n calling it evolution and others calling it God. You go out, make a few\n provisions for the future, and come back to climb into the time machine\n that's waiting in the building you had put around it. Then you'll be\n knocking on your own door, thirty years back\u2014or right now, from your\n view\u2014and telling your younger self all these things I'm telling you.\n\n\n But now....\n\n\n Well, the drinks are finished.
