  "article": "BIG ANCESTOR\nBy F. L. WALLACE\n\n\n Illustrated by EMSH\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nMan's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic\n \nrace an inferiority complex\u2014but then he tried to climb it!\nIn repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a\n package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under\n his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck\n was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only\n his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long\n though narrower ribbons.\n\n\n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good\n imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n\n\n \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was\n not unexpected\u2014non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient\n speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of\n humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many\n widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the\n ages before space travel\u2014\nand yet each planetary race can interbreed\n with a minimum of ten others\n! That's more than a legend\u2014one hell of a\n lot more!\"\n\n\n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly\n distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my\n species.\"\n\n\n \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own\n world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and\n that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole\n exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's\n accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human\n development.\n\"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the\n beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on\n Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.\n And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's\n a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to\n breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with\n Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may\n extend to Kelburn.\"\nTaphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was\n proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an\n unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n\n\n \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind\n of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\n hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\n few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\n actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\n stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n\n\n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\n Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude\n that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now\n found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout\n this section of the Milky Way.\"\n\n\n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across\n thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"\n commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n\n\n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n\n\n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the\n result of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races are\n involved, and\nonly\nthe human race.\"\n\n\n \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his\n ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories\n about himself.\"\n\n\n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous\n though not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as\n high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\n others\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\n together\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n\n\n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\n very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\n helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\n principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\n\n\n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n\n\n \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\n that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\n We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\n race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\n fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\n their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\n was a little further along. When we project back into time those star\n systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\n pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n\n\n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\n change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\n was interested.\nKelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\n stars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion\n of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n\n\n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're\n looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\n today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\n for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\n There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\n Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\n together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we\n calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n\n\n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\n the motion.\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\n equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't\n close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n\n\n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n\n\n \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\n humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\n with those they were adjacent to\ntwo hundred thousand years ago\n!\"\n\n\n \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"\n murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\n satisfies the calculations?\"\n\n\n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\n that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\n representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\n other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\n mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\n The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the\n time right.\"\n\n\n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\n ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n\n\n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic\n light-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a\n fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\n exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it\n this trip.\"\n\n\n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\n visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd\n better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n\n\n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\n was the most advanced human type present, but while there were\n differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\n as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\n the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\n lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\n there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\n this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\n respect.\n\n\n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\n your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n\n\n \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\n him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\n months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\n us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\n have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\n we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\n have an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\n ability.\"\n\n\n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\n plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\n such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\n the incentives?\"\n\n\n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\n Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\n cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\n profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n\n\n \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\n you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\n roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n\n\n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n\n\n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\n you all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that\n I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\n everywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n\n\n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\n integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n\n\n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\n for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\n ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the\n region toward which we're heading.\"\nFirmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and\n an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his\n eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the\n mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had\n been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of\n his place in the human hierarchy.\n\n\n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,\n wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how\n long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given\n much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy\n to see why.\n\n\n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the\n biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n\n\n \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more\n about these things than I do.\"\n\n\n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed\n to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still\n complains.\"\nHalden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n\n\n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes\n through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n\n\n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his\n evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense\n less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher\n humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't\n prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's\n reaction was quite typical.\n\n\n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said\n Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n\n\n \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do\n something about it.\"\n\n\n \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing\nI\ncan do.\" Halden paused\n thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n\n\n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n\n\n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n\n\n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as\n fast as they grow.\"\n\n\n \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.\n Use them.\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now\n they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The\n animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that\n way.\"\n\n\n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\n \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n\n\n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship\n was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n\n\n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n\n\n \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.\n \"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of\n places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with\n new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can\n do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n\n\n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place\n just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices\n everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n\n\n They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down\n because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of\n weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were\n trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n\n\n Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and\n leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of\n privileges.\"\n\n\n Halden started. So she\nknew\nthat the crew was calling her that!\n Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't\n said it. It didn't help the situation at all.\nTaphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,\n he wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs\n were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on\n the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never\n quite still.\n\n\n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech\n tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n\n\n \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n\n\n \"Neither do we.\"\n\n\n The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n\n\n \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small\n four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A\n typical pest.\"\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n\n\n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.\n \"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half\n a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had\n access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard\n radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are\n possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's\n developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things\n it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n\n\n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's\n smarter?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be\n so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's\n strong enough.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it\n over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about\n humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical\n ancestor?\"\n\n\n Emmer didn't look like the genius he was\u2014a Neanderthal genius, but\n nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a\n stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy\n hands through shaggier hair.\n\n\n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world\n with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of\n their camp.\"\n\n\n \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all\n humans\u2014late or early and male or female\u2014look remarkably alike. If you\n are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his\n speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\"\nEmmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?\n Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\n we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world\n was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\n it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\n structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\n forty feet high.\"\n\n\n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\n impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\n not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\n a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\n thousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n\n\n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n \"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\n ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\n they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\n they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\n never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\n long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\n Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\n they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\n advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\n plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\n did.\"\n\n\n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n\n\n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\n independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\n late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\n often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\n don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\n advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\n planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\n Taphetta.\n\n\n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n\n\n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\n or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\n atomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\n for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\n aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\n aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\n was tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\nTaphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this\n discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing\n where we came from.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment\n was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational\n institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual\n curiosity.\"\n\n\n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?\n When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than\n physiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Things\n that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in\n cultural discoveries.\"\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced\n civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've\n achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n\n\n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.\n \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,\n but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n\n\n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,\n working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and\n produced us. They\nwere\nmaster biologists.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your\n fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built\n up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling\n fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk\n using bait for your pest.\"\n\n\n He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's\n consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been\n bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer\n contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n\n\n \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as\n much as you think you will. The difference is this:\nMy\nterms don't\n permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n\n\n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding\n anything. Halden examined his own attitudes.\nHe\nhadn't intended, but\n could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?\n He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquired\n would have to be shared.\n\n\n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind of\n technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could\n improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start\n that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now.\n\"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing\n up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound\n animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n\n\n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with\n it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the\n two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a\n miniature keyboard.\n\n\n \"Ready?\"\n\n\n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at\n a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them\n exactly.\"\n\n\n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape\n crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming\n forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open\n floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n\n\n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the\n side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began\n nibbling what it could reach.\n\n\n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another\n shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one\n retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped\n and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up\n and mauled the other unmercifully.\nIt continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it\n backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.\n Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within\n reach, it climbed into the branches.\n\n\n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging\n itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no\n noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying\n away, still within range of the screen.\n\n\n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top\n and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed\n around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as\n it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent\n defeat.\n\n\n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and\n landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal\n heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping\n the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n\n\n The small one stood still till the last instant\u2014and then a paw\n flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of\n the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.\n The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped\n moving.\n\n\n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its\n foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been\n found\u2014\nand laid it down\n.\nAt Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too\n bright for anything to be visible.\n\n\n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out\n that the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n\n\n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their\n machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n\n\n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n\n\n \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\n exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n\n\n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't\n have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,\n they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n\n\n \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a\n creature without real hands?\"\n\n\n \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try\u2014and\n they'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n\n\n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I\n like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of\n marrying you.\"\n\n\n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew\n that, in relation to her, he was\nnot\nadvanced.\n\n\n \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by\n leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n\n\n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To\n her, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n\n\n They went to his cabin.\n\n\n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\n wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\n long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\n except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\n the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\n development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\n the violet end of the spectrum.\n\n\n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\n primeval Earth.\"\n\n\n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\n her own world. She had something else in mind.\n\n\n \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n\n\n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\n have subhuman monsters.\"\n\n\n \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\n It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\n surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\n them start lower than I am?\"\n\n\n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\n it governed personal relations between races that were united against\n non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n\n\n \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n\n\n \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n\n\n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\n permanent union.\n\n\n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n\n\n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it\n lead me astray.\"\n\n\n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific\n about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n\n\n \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't\n like him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n\n\n \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.\n There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\nShe provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race\n had a body like hers and she knew it.\n\n\n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and\n I would be infertile.\"\n\n\n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act\n unconcerned.\n\n\n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique\n smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n\n\n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n\n\n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction\n was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh\n give when his knuckles struck it.\n\n\n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took\n it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front\n of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n\n\n \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the\n blood and pain.\"\n\n\n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She\n closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back\n and looked at herself critically.\n\n\n \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it\n healed by morning.\"\n\n\n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across\n the bridge. Then she came over to him.\n\n\n \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n\n\n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,\n invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still\n feel that attraction to her?\n\n\n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and\n he's even more savage than I am.\"\n\n\n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too\n much, though. You're just right.\"\n\n\n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what\n Emmer would do\u2014and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of\n the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage\u2014what\n advantage?\u2014for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,\n nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the\n higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he\n wanted her.\n\n\n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry\n you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children\n I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n\n\n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not\n completely her fault. Besides....\n\n\n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior\n children\u2014and they might be his.\n\n\n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were\n they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime\n toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over\u2014no,\nthrough\n\u2014everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry\u2014onward and\n upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger\n was turned.\n\n\n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already\n broken it once.\"\n\n\n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.\n",
