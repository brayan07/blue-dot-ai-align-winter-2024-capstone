  "article": "THE LONG REMEMBERED THUNDER\nBY KEITH LAUMER\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nHe was as ancient as time\u2014and as strange as\n\n his own frightful battle against incredible odds!\nI\n\n\n In his room at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, Tremaine opened his luggage\n and took out a small tool kit, used a screwdriver to remove the bottom\n cover plate from the telephone. He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,\n crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance\n Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n\n\n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the\n wire as the scrambler went into operation.\n\n\n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys\n are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this\n damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest\n of the afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered\n hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond\u2014I can't\n wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing\n me.\"\n\n\n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got\n some answers to go with the questions?\"\n\n\n \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind\n that. This fellow Margrave\u2014General Margrave. Project Officer for the\n hyperwave program\u2014he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I\n blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret\n project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.\n Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let\n me do it my way.\"\n\n\n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator\n could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home\n area\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I\n sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm\n warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\"\nTremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street\n and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY\n MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a\n heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind\n an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the\n opposite corner of his mouth.\n\n\n \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of\n authority.\n\n\n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,\n though.\"\n\n\n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He\n came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What\n brings you back to the boondocks?\"\n\n\n \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n\n\n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a\n visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n\n\n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered\n the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the\n high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission\n produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He\n passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric\n circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n\n\n \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these\n points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction\n pattern\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your\n word for it.\"\n\n\n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this\n section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's\n near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n\n\n \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the\n news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says\n is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken\n to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord\n intended.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had\n something ...\"\n\n\n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a\n hundred years old when I was kid.\"\n\n\n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his\n groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n\n\n \"Well, what about him?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little\n touched in the head.\"\n\n\n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine\n said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something\n I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.\n I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and\n sometimes he gave us apples.\"\n\"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this\n town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram\n has blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and he\n talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an\n ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.\n But we never did know where he came from.\"\n\n\n \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n\n\n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about\n ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She\n was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same\n old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died\n five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every\n Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened\n then?\"\n\n\n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all\n over again.\"\n\n\n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in\n the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around\n with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the\n prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the\n other drug store....\"\n\n\n \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him\n and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it\n on fire.\"\n\n\n \"What was the idea of that?\"\n\n\n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was\n passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here\n for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke\n routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back\n in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day\n they'll make jail age.\"\n\n\n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any\n dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n\n\n \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew\n about Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head.\n\n\n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired\n by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in\n her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I\n remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.\n Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to\n think she was some kind of princess....\"\n\n\n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\"\nJess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,\n frowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n\n eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties\u2014and that made\n her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting\n her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six\n foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair\u2014and a stranger to\n boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local\n bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny\n about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But\n this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down\n there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,\n practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy\n shay. And the next day, she was home again\u2014alone. That finished off\n her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was\n ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was\n already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram\n in front of her.\"\n\n\n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears\n and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.\n Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n\n\n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of\n detector you were going to set up?\"\n\n\n \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up\n in my room over at the hotel.\"\n\n\n \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n\n\n \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely\n repeating logarithmic sequence, based on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me\n know if you want anything. And by the way\u2014\" he winked broadly\u2014\"I\n always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front\n teeth.\"\nII\n\n\n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town\n Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow\n autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the\n steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,\n a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said\n \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n\n\n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at\n Tremaine.\n\n\n \"We're closed,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the\n Bram property changed hands last.\"\n\n\n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?\n He dead?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n\n\n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to\n sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n\n\n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n\n\n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping\n to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.\n A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward\n it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n\n\n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n\n\n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where\n a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a\n line written in faded ink:\n\n\n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter\n Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)\"\n\n\n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n\n\n \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the\n nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to\n the door.\n\n\n \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of\n trouble?\"\n\n\n \"No. No trouble.\"\n\n\n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"\n he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be\n dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n\n\n \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about\n old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and\n lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n\n\n \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.\n \"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n\n\n Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"You\u2014uh\u2014paying anything for information?\"\n\n\n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n\n\n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway\u2014I can swear to this.\n Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\"\nUntrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco\n facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a\n paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n\n\n \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The\n older are there in the shelves.\"\n\n\n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n\n\n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle\n these old papers carefully.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed\n through it, muttering.\n\n\n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n\n\n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n\n\n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,\n adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she\n said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the\n dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front\n page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American\n Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.\n Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n\n\n On page four, under a column headed\nCounty Notes\nhe saw the name Bram:\n\n\n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,\n north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of\n Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a\n few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has\n been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past\n months.\n\n\n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n\n\n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the\n heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to\n her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught\n his eye:\n\n\n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much\n alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and\n thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine\n woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of\n timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along\n the river.\n\n\n The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.\n You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in\n windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a\n cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n\n\n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint\n squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward\n of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped\n short, stared after the car.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.\n Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked\n open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed\n north after the police car.\nTwo miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine\n rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the\n highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.\n The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n\n\n \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n\n\n \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n\n\n \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n\n\n \"We could be.\"\n\n\n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted\n chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to\n him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike\n before handing it to Tremaine.\n\n\n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef,\n Tremaine?\"\n\n\n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave\n the word, Grammond.\"\n\n\n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out\n on me.\"\n\n\n \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were\n doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n\n\n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it\n apart brick by brick in the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll\n go underground.\"\n\n\n \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use\n for the spade work, that it?\"\n\n\n \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n\n\n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching\n out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling\n all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs\n three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n\n\n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all\n the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\"\nBack in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n\n\n \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.\n Tell him if he queers this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back\n over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia\n moonshiners.\"\n\n\n \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out\n your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine\n hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of\n Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat\n and left the hotel.\n\n\n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He\n walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a\n once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its\n windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the\n ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button\n beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute\n before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned\n face looked at him coolly.\n\n\n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss\n Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.\n Only a faint quaver reflected her age\u2014close to eighty, Tremaine\n thought, startled.\n\n\n \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the\n furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a\n straight chair across the room from him.\n\n\n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see\n that you've amounted to something.\"\n\n\n \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n\n\n \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even\n as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n\n\n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n\n\n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some\n information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your\n discretion?\"\n\n\n \"Of course.\"\n\n\n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\"\nMiss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\n used against him?\"\n\n\n \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\n to be in the national interest.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\n James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n\n\n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\n year.\"\n\n\n \"What does he do for a living?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\n piece of country? What's his story?\"\n\n\n \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n\n\n \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\n last?\"\n\n\n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n\n\n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n\n\n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\n impatiently.\n\n\n \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n\n\n Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\n you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\n complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\n be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\n She paused. Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\n him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\n He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\n a cave beneath his house.\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\n and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\n twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\n we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\n open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\n there alone.\n\n\n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\n to speak to me but I would not listen.\n\n\n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\n keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\n in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\n consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\n He never called again.\"\n\n\n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\n silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\n am, James.\"\n\n\n \"May I see it?\"\n\n\n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\n examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll nodded.\n\n\n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n\n\n \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n\n\n \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\nIII\n\n\n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\n pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\n asked:\n\n\n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\n dud, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\n a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n\n\n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\n State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\n from what you were saying to me.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\n me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\n wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\n working\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\n and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\n and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\n mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n\n\n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\n Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\n before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\n out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\n door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\n the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\n a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\n empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\n said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n\n\n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\n Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\n gun?\"\n\n\n \"In the car.\"\n\n\n \"Better get it.\"\n\n\n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\n rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\n Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\n lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n\n\n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n\n\n \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\n distance.\n\n\n \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n\n\n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\n Tremaine said.\n\n\n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\n light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n\n\n \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\n slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n\n\n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n\n\n \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\n It ended suddenly near the wall.\n\n\n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n\n\n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\n stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\n he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\n tricks?\"\n\n\n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\n questions.\"\nAt the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy\n lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop\n of greased hair.\n\n\n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung\n the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\n \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong\n with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n\n\n \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that\n out, Hull?\"\n\n\n \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we\n heard....\"\n\n\n \"What did you hear?\"\n\n\n \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n\n\n \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n\n\n \"Cops.\"\n\n\n \"Who says so?\"\n\n\n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to\n the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all\n night.\"\n\n\n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called\n me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get\n them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around\n hers.\"\n\n\n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n\n\n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the\n spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out\n that way, ain't he?\"\n\n\n \"Anything else?\"\n\n\n The boy looked at his feet.\n",
