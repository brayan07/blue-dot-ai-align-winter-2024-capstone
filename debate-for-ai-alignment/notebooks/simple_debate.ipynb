      "Both debaters make valid points, but after evaluating their arguments, it becomes clear that the emphasis on Si's proficiency makes Debater B's position stronger. While both debaters agree on the logistical challenges of training a new pilot, Debater B highlights Si's exceptional skill level. \n",
      "\n",
      "This expertise likely makes Si an irreplaceable asset to the Department, even beyond the training timeline issue. Thus, the Department's hope for Si to continue for three more space missions isn't just about preventing operational delays, but also about ensuring that the best candidate is at the helm during critical missions. \n",
