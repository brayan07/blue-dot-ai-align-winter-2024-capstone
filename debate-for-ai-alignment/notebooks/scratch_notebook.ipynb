YOUNG\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Worlds of Tomorrow April 1963\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nEvery man\\'s mind is a universe with countless\\n\\n places in which he can hide—even from himself!\\nThe dance that the chocoletto girl was performing was an expurgated\\n version of the kylee sex ritual which the Louave maidens of Dubhe 7\\n practiced on the eve of their betrothal. Expurgated or not, however,\\n it was still on the lascivious side. The G-string that constituted\\n the chocoletto girl\\'s entire costume put her but one degree above the\\n nakedness which the original dance demanded. Nathan Blake\\'s voice was\\n slightly thick when he summoned the waiter who was hovering in the\\n shadows at the back of the room. \"Is she free?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n \"I do not know, mensakin. Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\\n Blake resumed watching. The girl\\'s movements were a delicate blend of\\n love and lust. Her face accompanied her body, eyes half-lidded one\\n moment to match the languid motion of her limbs, wide and feral the\\n next to match the furious bump and grind of her hips. For a chocoletto\\n she was light-skinned—more bronze, really, than brown. But then,\\n the word \"chocoletto\", coined by the early beche-la-mer traders, was\\n misleading, and few of the natives of Dubhe 4\\'s southern-most continent\\n lived up to it completely.\\n\\n\\n She was beautiful too. Her high-cheekboned face was striking—the eyes\\n dark-brown and wide-apart, the mouth sensuous, the teeth showing in a\\n vivid white line between the half-parted purple lips. And her body was\\n splendid. Blake had never seen anyone quite like her.\\n\\n\\n He beckoned to her when the dance was over and, after slipping into\\n a white thigh-length tunic, she joined him at his table. She ordered\\n Martian wine in a liquid voice, and sipped it with a finesse that\\n belied her cannibalistic forebears. \"You wish a night?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n Blake nodded. \"If you are free.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Three thousand quandoes.\"\\n\\n\\n He did not haggle, but counted out the amount and handed it to her. She\\n slipped the bills into a thigh sheath-purse, told him her hut number\\n and stood up to leave. \"I will meet you there in an hour,\" she said.\\nHer hut was as good a place to wait for her as any. After buying a\\n bottle of native whiskey at the bar, Blake went out into the Dubhe 4\\n night and made his way through the labyrinthine alleys of the native\\n sector. In common with all chocoletto huts, Eldoria\\'s was uncared for\\n on the outside, and gave a false impression of poverty. He expected to\\n find the usual hanger-on waiting in the anteroom, and looked forward to\\n booting him out into the alley. Instead he found a young girl—\\n\\n\\n A human girl.\\n\\n\\n He paused in the doorway. The girl was sitting cross-legged on a small\\n mat, a book open on her lap. Xenophon\\'s\\nAnabasis\\n. Her hair made him\\n think of the copper-colored sunrises of Norma 9 and her eyes reminded\\n him of the blue tarns of Fornax 6. \"Come in,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n After closing the door, he sat down opposite her on the guest mat.\\n Behind her, a gaudy arras hid the hut\\'s other room. \"You are here to\\n wait for Eldoria?\" she asked.\\n\\n\\n Blake nodded. \"And you?\"\\n\\n\\n She laughed. \"I am here because I live here,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n He tried to assimilate the information, but could not. Perceiving his\\n difficulty, the girl went on, \"My parents indentured themselves to the\\n Great Starway Cartel and were assigned to the rubber plantations of\\n Dubhe 4. They died of yellow-water dysentery before their indenture ran\\n out, and in accordance with Interstellar Law I was auctioned off along\\n with the rest of their possessions. Eldoria bought me.\"\\n\\n\\n Five years as a roving psycheye had hardened Blake to commercial\\n colonization practices; nevertheless, he found the present example of\\n man\\'s inhumanity to man sickening.\\n\\n\\n \"How old are you?\" Blake asked.\\n\\n\\n \"Fourteen.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Probably I shall be a psychiatrist. Eldoria is sending me to the\\n mission school now, and afterward she is going to put me through an\\n institute of higher learning. And when I come of age, she is going to\\n give me my freedom.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" Blake said. He indicated the book on her lap. \"Homework?\"\\n\\n\\n She shook her head. \"In addition to my courses at the mission school, I\\n am studying the humanities.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Xenophon,\" Blake said. \"And I suppose Plato too.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And Homer and Virgil and Aeschylus and Euripides and all the rest of\\n them. When I grow up I shall be a most well-educated person.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m sure you will be,\" Blake said, looking at the arras.\\n\\n\\n \"My name is Deirdre.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Nathan,\" Blake said. \"Nathan Blake.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Eldoria will be arriving soon. I must go and prepare her dais.\"\\nShe got up, parted the arras, and slipped into the next room. Shame\\n flamed in Blake\\'s cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then\\n he remembered Eldoria\\'s dance, and he went right on sitting where he\\n was.\\n\\n\\n Presently the girl returned, and not long afterward the cloying scent\\n of native incense crept beneath the arras and permeated the anteroom.\\n She sat sideways on the mat this time, and he caught her face in\\n profile. There was a suggestion of saintliness in the line of the nose\\n and chin, a suggestion made all the more poignant by the slender column\\n of the neck. He shifted uncomfortably on the guest mat. She had taken\\n up the\\nAnabasis\\nagain, and silence was pounding silent fists upon the\\n walls.\\n\\n\\n He was relieved when Eldoria finally arrived. She ushered him into\\n the next room immediately. It was slightly larger than the anteroom,\\n and much more richly appointed. A thick carpet the color of Martian\\n waterways lay upon the floor, contrasting pleasantly with the golden\\n tapestries that adorned all four walls. The sleeping dais was oval\\n and took up nearly half the floor space. It was strewn with scarlet\\n cushions.\\n\\n\\n Blake sat down upon it. Nervously he watched Eldoria slip out of her\\n white street robe, his eyes moving back and forth from her smooth dark\\n skin to the arras. The incense thickened around him.\\n\\n\\n She noticed the back-and-forth movement of his eyes. \"You need not fear\\n the little one,\" she said, laying her hand upon his knee. \"She will not\\n enter.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not that so much,\" Blake said.\\n\\n\\n \"What?\" The warm bronze shoulder was touching his....\\n\\n\\n He rose up once in the night, thinking to find his hotel bed. His next\\n awakening was in the grayness of dawn, and he got up and dressed and\\n moved silently to the doorway. The girl slept just without the arras on\\n a thin sleeping-mat, and he had to step over her to gain the anteroom.\\n In sleep, a strand of her copper-colored hair had tumbled down across\\n her forehead and lay like a lovely flower upon the virginal whiteness\\n of her skin. There was something saintly about her quiet face.\\n\\n\\n When he reached the alley he began to run, and he did not stop running\\n till the chocoletto sector was far behind him.\\nThe hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were\\n notoriously steep. Blake was breathing hard when he reached the crest.\\n\\n\\n Before him lay a memory-image of a section of Deneb 1 wasteland. The\\n image extended for no more than half a mile, but Blake was annoyed\\n that he should have remembered even that much of the wretched terrain.\\n Ideally, a man\\'s mind-country should have been comprised only of the\\n places and times he wanted to remember. Practically, however, that was\\n far from being the case.\\n\\n\\n He glanced back down into the rain-pocked valley that he had just\\n crossed. The rain and the mist made for poor visibility. He could only\\n faintly distinguish the three figures of his pursuers. The trio seemed\\n a little closer now.\\nEver since he had first set foot into his mind, some ten hours ago,\\n they had been on his trail, but for some reason he had been unable\\n to bring himself to go back and find out who they were and what they\\n wanted. Hence he was as vexed with himself as he was with them.\\n\\n\\n After resting for a few minutes, he descended the hill and started\\n across the Deneb 1 wasteland. It was a remarkably detailed\\n materialization, and his quarry\\'s footprints stood out clearly in the\\n duplicated sand.\\n\\n\\n Sabrina York did not even know the rudiments of the art of throwing\\n off a mind-tracker. It would have done her but little good if she\\n had, for twelve years as a psycheye had taught Blake all the tricks.\\n Probably she had taken it for granted that the mere act of hiding out\\n in her tracker\\'s mind was in itself a sufficient guarantee of her\\n safety. After all, she had no way of knowing that he had discovered her\\n presence.\\n\\n\\n Mind-country was as temporally inconsecutive as it was topographically\\n incongruous, so Blake was not surprised when the Deneb 1 wasteland gave\\n way to an expanse of boyhood meadow. Near the meadow was the house\\n where Blake had lived at a much later date. In reality, the places were\\n as far apart in miles as they were in years, but here in the country\\n of his mind they existed side by side, surrounded by heterogeneous\\n landscapes from all over the civilized sector of the galaxy and by the\\n sharply demarcated spectra of a hundred different suns. A few of the\\n suns were in the patchwork sky—Sirius, for example, and its twinkling\\n dwarf companion. Most of them, however, were present only in their\\n remembered radiance. To add to the confusion, scattered night memories\\n interrupted the hodge-podge horizon with columns of darkness, and here\\n and there the gray column of a dawn or dusk memory showed.\\n\\n\\n The house was flanked on one side by a section of a New Earth spaceport\\n and on the other by an excerpt of an Ex-earth city-block. Behind it\\n flowed a brief blue stretch of Martian waterway.\\n\\n\\n Sabrina\\'s footsteps led up to the front door, and the door itself was\\n ajar. Perhaps she was still inside. Perhaps she was watching him even\\n now through one of the remembered windows. He scanned them with a\\n professional eye, but saw no sign of her.\\n\\n\\n Warily he stepped inside, adjusting the temperature of his all-weather\\n jacket to the remembered air-conditioning. His father was sitting in\\n the living room, smoking, and watching 3V. He had no awareness of\\n Blake. At Blake\\'s entry he went right on smoking and watching as though\\n the door had neither opened nor closed. He would go right on smoking\\n and watching till Blake died and the conglomeration of place-times\\n that constituted Blake\\'s mind-world ceased to be. Ironically, he was\\n watching nothing. The 3V program that had been in progress at the time\\n of the unconscious materialization had failed to come through.\\nThe memory was a treasured one—the old man had perished in a \\'copter\\n crash several years ago—and for a long while Blake did not move.\\n He had never been in his own mind before. Consequently he was more\\n affected than he might otherwise have been. Finally, stirring himself,\\n he walked out into the kitchen. On a shelf above the sink stood a gaily\\n colored box of his mother\\'s favorite detergent with a full-length\\n drawing of Vera Velvetskin, the company\\'s blond and chic visual symbol,\\n on the front. His mother was standing before the huge automatic range,\\n preparing a meal she had served twenty-three years ago. He regarded her\\n with moist eyes. She had died a dozen years before his father, but the\\n wound that her death had caused had never healed. He wanted to go up\\n behind her and touch her shoulder and say, \"What\\'s for supper, mom?\"\\n but he knew it would do no good. For her he had no reality, not only\\n because he was far in her future, but because in his mind-world she was\\n a mortal and he, a god—a picayune god, perhaps, but a real one.\\n\\n\\n As he was about to turn away, the name-plate on the range caught his\\n eye, and thinking that he had read the two words wrong, he stepped\\n closer so that he could see them more clearly. No, he had made no\\n mistake: the first word was \"Sabrina\", and the second was \"York\".\\n\\n\\n He stepped back. Odd that a kitchen range should have the same name as\\n his quarry. But perhaps not unduly so. Giving appliances human names\\n had been common practice for centuries. Even a name like \"Sabrina\\n York\", while certainly not run-of-the-mill, was bound to be duplicated\\n in real life. Nevertheless a feeling of uneasiness accompanied him when\\n he left the kitchen and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\\n\\n\\n He went through each room systematically, but saw no sign of Sabrina\\n York. He lingered for some time in his own room, wistfully watching his\\n fifteen-year-old self lolling on the bed with a dog-eared copy of\\nThe\\n Galaxy Boys and the Secret of the Crab Nebula\\n, then he stepped back\\n out into the hall and started to descend the stairs.\\n\\n\\n At the head of the stairs a narrow window looked out over the front\\n yard and thence out over the meadow. He glanced absently through the\\n panes, and came to an abrupt halt. His three pursuers were wading\\n through the long meadow grass less than a quarter of a mile away—not\\n close enough as yet for him to be able to make out their faces, but\\n close enough for him to be able to see that two of them were wearing\\n dresses and that the third had on a blue skirt and blouse, and a kepi\\n to match. He gasped. It simply hadn\\'t occurred to him that his pursuers\\n might be women. To his consternation he discovered that he was even\\n more loath to go back and accost them than he had been before. He\\n actually had an impulse to flee.\\n\\n\\n He controlled it and descended the stairs with exaggerated slowness,\\n leaving the house by way of the back door. He picked up Sabrina\\'s trail\\n in the back yard and followed it down to the Martian waterway and\\n thence along the bank to where the waterway ended and a campus began.\\n Not the campus of the university which he had visited two days ago to\\n attend his protegee\\'s graduation. It was not a place-time that he cared\\n to revisit, nor a moment that he cared to relive, but Sabrina\\'s trail\\n led straight across the artificially stunted grass toward the little\\n bench where he and Deirdre Eldoria had come to talk after the ceremony\\n was over. He had no choice.\\nThe bench stood beneath a towering American elm whose feathery branches\\n traced green arabesques against the blue June sky. A set of footprints\\n slightly deeper than its predecessors indicated that Sabrina had\\n paused by the trunk. Despite himself Blake paused there too. Pain\\n tightened his throat when he looked at Deirdre\\'s delicate profile\\n and copper-colored hair, intensified when he lowered his eyes to the\\n remembered blueness of her graduation dress. The diamond brooch that he\\n had given her as a graduation present, and which she had proudly pinned\\n upon her bodice for the whole wide world to see, made him want to\\n cry. His self-image of two weeks ago shocked him. There were lines on\\n the face that did not as yet exist, and the brown hair was shot with\\n streaks of gray that had yet to come into being. Lord, he must have\\n been feeling old to have pictured himself like that!\\n\\n\\n Deirdre was speaking. \"Yes,\" she was saying, \"at nine o\\'clock. And I\\n should very much like for you to come.\"\\n\\n\\n Blake Past shook his head. \"Proms aren\\'t for parents. You know that\\n as well as I do. That young man you were talking with a few minutes\\n ago—he\\'s the one who should take you. He\\'d give his right arm for the\\n chance.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll thank you not to imply that you\\'re my father. One would think\\n from the way you talk that you are centuries old!\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'m thirty-eight,\" Blake Past said, \"and while I may not be your\\n father, I\\'m certainly old enough to be. That young man—\"\\n\\n\\n A pink flush of anger climbed into Deirdre Eldoria\\'s girlish cheeks.\\n \"What right has\\nhe\\ngot to take me! Did\\nhe\\nscrimp and go without\\n in order to put me through high school and college? Has\\nhe\\nbooked\\n passage for me to New Earth and paid my tuition to Trevor University?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Please,\" Blake Past said, desperation deepening his voice. \"You\\'re\\n only making everything worse. After majoring in Trevorism, you\\n certainly ought to realize by now that there was nothing noble about my\\n buying you after Eldoria died. I only did it to ease my conscience—\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do\\nyou\\nknow about conscience?\" Deirdre demanded. \"Conscience\\n is a much more complex mechanism than most laymen realize. Guilt\\n feelings aren\\'t reliable criteria. They can stem from false\\n causes—from ridiculous things like a person\\'s inability to accept\\n himself for what he is.\" Abruptly she dropped the subject. \"Don\\'t you\\n realize, Nate,\" she went on a little desperately, \"that I\\'m leaving\\n tomorrow and that we won\\'t see each other again for years and years?\"\\n\\n\\n \"I\\'ll come to New Earth to visit you,\" Blake said. \"Venus is only a few\\n days distant on the new ships.\"\\n\\n\\n She stood up. \"You won\\'t come—I know you won\\'t.\" She stamped her foot.\\n \"And you won\\'t come to the prom either. I know that too. I knew it all\\n along. Sometimes I\\'m tempted to—\" Abruptly she broke off. \"Very well\\n then,\" she went on, \"I\\'ll say good-by now then.\"\\n\\n\\n Blake Past stood up too. \"No, not yet. I\\'ll walk back to the sorority\\n house with you.\"\\n\\n\\n She tossed her head, but the sadness in her tarn-blue eyes belied her\\n hauteur. \"If you wish,\" she said.\\nBlake Present watched them set out side by side toward the remembered\\n halls of learning that showed in the distance. There had been other\\n people present on the campus that afternoon, but as they had failed to\\n register on Blake Past\\'s mind, they did not exist for Blake Present.\\n All that existed for Blake Present were the diminishing figures of the\\n girl and the man, and the pain that was constricting his throat.\\n\\n\\n Wretchedly he turned away. As he did so he saw the three shadows lying\\n at his feet and knew that his pursuers had at last caught up to him.\\n\\n\\n His first reaction when he faced them was amazement. His next reaction\\n was shock. His third was fear.\\n\\n\\n His amazement resulted from recognition. One of the three women arrayed\\n before him was Miss Stoddart, his boyhood Sunday-school teacher.\\n Standing next to her in a familiar blue uniform was Officer Finch,\\n the police woman who had maintained law and order in the collective\\n elementary school he had attended. Standing next to Officer Finch was\\n blond and chic Vera Velvetskin, whose picture he had seen on box after\\n countless box of his mother\\'s favorite detergent.\\n\\n\\n His shock resulted from the expressions on the three faces. Neither\\n Miss Stoddart nor Officer Finch ever particularly liked him, but they\\n had never particularly disliked him either. This Miss Stoddart and this\\n Officer Finch disliked him, though. They hated him. They hated him so\\n much that their hatred had thinned out their faces and darkened their\\n eyes. More shocking yet, Vera Velvetskin, who had never existed save\\n in some copywriter\\'s mind, hated him too. In fact, judging from the\\n greater thinness of her face and the more pronounced darkness of her\\n eyes, she hated him even more than Miss Stoddart and Officer Finch did.\\n\\n\\n His fear resulted from the realization that his mind-world contained\\n phenomena it had no right to contain—not if he was nearly as\\n well-adjusted as he considered himself to be. The three women standing\\n before him definitely were not memory-images. They were too vivid, for\\n one thing. For another, they were aware of him. What were they, then?\\n And what were they doing in his mind?\\n\\n\\n He asked the two questions aloud.\\n\\n\\n Three arms were raised and three forefingers were pointed accusingly at\\n his chest. Three pairs of eyes burned darkly. \"You ask us that?\" Miss\\n Stoddart said. \"Callous creature who did a maiden\\'s innocence affront!\"\\n said Officer Finch. \"And sought sanctuary in ill-fitting robes of\\n righteousness!\" said Vera Velvetskin. The three faces moved together,\\n blurred and seemed to blend into one. The three voices were raised in\\n unison: \"You know who we are, Nathan Blake.\\nYou\\nknow who we are!\"\\n\\n\\n Blake stared at them open-mouthed. Then he turned and fled.\\nIt had taken man a long time to discover that he was a god in his\\n own right and that he too was capable of creating universes. Trivial\\n universes, to be sure, when compared with the grandeur and scope of the\\n objective one, and peopled with ghosts instead of human beings; but\\n universes nonetheless.\\n\\n\\n The discovery came about quite by accident. After projecting himself\\n into a patient\\'s memory one day, a psychologist named Trevor suddenly\\n found himself clinging to the slope of a traumatically distorted\\n mountain. His patient was beside him.\\n\\n\\n The mountain proved to be an unconscious memory-image out of the\\n patient\\'s boyhood, and its country proved to be the country of the\\n patient\\'s mind. After many trials and errors, Trevor managed to get\\n both himself and his patient back to the objective world, and not long\\n afterward he was able to duplicate the feat on another case.\\n\\n\\n The next logical step was to enter his own mind, and this he also\\n succeeded in doing.\\n\\n\\n It was inevitable that Trevor should write a book about his discovery\\n and set about founding a new school of psychology. It was equally\\n inevitable that he should acquire enemies as well as disciples.\\n However, as the years passed and the new therapy which he devised cured\\n more and more psychoses, the ranks of his disciples swelled and those\\n of his enemies shrank. When, shortly before his death, he published a\\n paper explaining how anyone could enter his or her own mind-world at\\n will, his niche in the Freudian hall of fame was assured.\\n\\n\\n The method employed an ability that had been evolving in the human mind\\n for millennia—the ability to project oneself into a past moment—or,\\n to use Trevor\\'s term, a past \"place-time.\" Considerable practice was\\n required before the first transition could be achieved, but once it\\n was achieved, successive transitions became progressively easier.\\n Entering another person\\'s mind-world was of course a more difficult\\n undertaking, and could be achieved only after an intensive study of\\n a certain moment in that person\\'s past. In order to return to the\\n objective world, it was necessary in both cases to locate the most\\n recently materialized place-time and take one step beyond it.\\n\\n\\n By their very nature, mind-countries were confusing. They existed on\\n a plane of reality that bore no apparent relationship to the plane\\n of the so-called objective universe. In fact, so far as was known,\\n this secondary—or subjective—reality was connected to so-called\\n true reality only through the awareness of the various creators. In\\n addition, these countries had no outward shape in the ordinary sense of\\n the word, and while most countries contained certain parallel images,\\n these images were subject to the interpretation of the individual\\n creator. As a result they were seldom identical.\\nIt was inevitable that sooner or later some criminal would hit upon\\n the idea of hiding out in his own mind-world till the statute of\\n limitations that applied to his particular crime ran out, and it was\\n equally inevitable that others should follow suit. Society\\'s answer was\\n the psyche-police, and the psyche-police hadn\\'t been in action very\\n long before the first private psycheye appeared.\\n\\n\\n Blake was one of a long line of such operators.\\n\\n\\n So far as he knew, the present case represented the first time a\\n criminal had ever hidden out in the pursuer\\'s mind. It would have been\\n a superb stratagem indeed if, shortly after her entry, Sabrina York\\n had not betrayed her presence. For her point of entry she had used\\n the place-time materialization of the little office Blake had opened\\n on Ex-earth at the beginning of his career. Unaccountably she had\\n ransacked it before moving into a co-terminous memory-image.\\n\\n\\n Even this action wouldn\\'t have given her away, however, if the office\\n hadn\\'t constituted a sentimental memory. Whenever Blake accepted a case\\n he invariably thought of the bleak and lonely little room with its\\n thin-gauge steel desk and battered filing cabinets, and when he had\\n done so after accepting his case—or was it before? He couldn\\'t quite\\n remember—the mental picture that had come into his mind had revealed\\n open drawers, scattered papers and a general air of disarray.\\n\\n\\n He had suspected the truth immediately, and when he had seen the\\n woman\\'s handkerchief with the initials \"SB\" embroidered on it lying\\n by one of the filing cabinets he had known definitely that his quarry\\n was hiding out in his mind. Retiring to his bachelor quarters, he had\\n entered at the same place-time and set off in pursuit.\\n\\n\\n Her only advantage lost, Sabrina York was now at his mercy. Unless\\n she discovered his presence and was able to locate his most recently\\n materialized place-time before he over-took her, her capture was\\n assured.\\n\\n\\n Only two things bothered Blake. The little office was far in his past,\\n and it was unlikely that anyone save the few intimate acquaintances\\n whom he had told about it were aware that it had ever existed. How,\\n then, had a total stranger such as Sabrina York learned enough about it\\n to enable her to use it as a point of entry?\\n\\n\\n The other thing that bothered him was of a much more urgent nature.\\n He had been in enough minds and he had read enough on the subject\\n of Trevorism to know that people were sometimes capable of creating\\n beings considerably higher on the scale of mind-country evolution\\n than ordinary memory-ghosts. One woman whom he had apprehended in her\\n own mind had created a walking-talking Virgin Mary who watched over\\n her wherever she went. And once, after tracking down an ex-enlisted\\n man, he had found his quarry holed up in the memory-image of an army\\n barracks with a ten-star general waiting on him hand and foot. But\\n these, and other, similar, cases, had to do with mal-adjusted people,\\n and moreover, the super-image in each instance had been an image that\\n the person involved had\\nwanted\\nto create. Therefore, even assuming\\n that Blake was less well-adjusted than he considered himself to be, why\\n had he created three such malevolent super-images as Miss Stoddart,\\n Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin?\\nThey followed him off the campus into a vicarious memory-image of\\n Walden Pond, Thoreau\\'s shack, and the encompassing woods. Judging from\\n the ecstatic \"oh\\'s\" and \"ah\\'s\" they kept giving voice to, the place\\n delighted them. Once, glancing back over his shoulder, he saw them\\n standing in front of Thoreau\\'s shack, looking at it as though it were a\\n doll\\'s house. Not far away, Thoreau was sitting in under a tall pine,\\n gazing up into the branches at a bird that had come through only as a\\n vague blur of beak and feathers.\\n\\n\\n Blake went on. Presently the Walden Pond memory-image gave way to a\\n memory-image of an English park which the ex-Earth government had set\\n aside as a memorial to the English poets and which had impressed Blake\\n sufficiently when he had visited it in his youth to have found a place\\n for itself in the country of his mind. It consisted of reconstructions\\n of famous dwellings out of the lives of the poets, among them, a\\n dwelling out of the life of a poet who was not in the strictest sense\\n of the word English at all—the birthplace of Robert Burns. Oddly\\n enough, it was Burns\\'s birthplace that had impressed Blake most. Now\\n the little cottage stood out in much more vivid detail than any of the\\n other famous dwellings.\\n\\n\\n Sabrina York must have been attracted to the place, for her footprints\\n showed that she had turned in at the gate, walked up the little path\\n and let herself in the door.\\n\\n\\n They also showed that she had left by the same route, so there was no\\n reason for Blake to linger. As a matter of fact, the fascination that\\n had brought the place into being had been replaced by an illogical\\n repugnance. But repugnance can sometimes be as compelling a force as\\n fascination, and Blake not only lingered but went inside as well.\\n\\n\\n He remembered the living room distinctly—the flagstone floor, the huge\\n grill-fronted hearth, the deeply recessed window, the rack of cups and\\n platters on the wall; the empty straight-backed chair standing sternly\\n in a corner, the bare wooden table—\\n\\n\\n He paused just within the doorway. The chair was no longer empty, the\\n table no longer bare.\\n\\n\\n A man sat on the former and a bottle of wine stood on the latter.\\n Moreover, the room showed signs of having been lived in for a long\\n time. The floor was covered with tracked-in dirt and the walls were\\n blackened from smoke. The grill-work of the hearth was begrimed with\\n grease.\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

GALLUN\\nA scream of brakes, the splash\\n into icy waters, a long descent\\n into alkaline depths ... it was\\n death. But Ned Vince lived\\n again—a million years later!\\n\"See\\n you in half an hour,\\n Betty,\" said Ned Vince\\n over the party telephone. \"We\\'ll\\n be out at the Silver Basket before\\n ten-thirty....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was eager for the\\n company of the girl he loved.\\n That was why he was in a hurry\\n to get to the neighboring town\\n of Hurley, where she lived. His\\n old car rattled and roared as he\\n swung it recklessly around Pit\\n Bend.\\n\\n\\n There was where Death tapped\\n him on the shoulder. Another car\\n leaped suddenly into view, its\\n lights glaring blindingly past a\\n high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic\\n rock at the turn of the road.\\n\\n\\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his\\n own rash speed, Ned Vince had\\n only swift young reflexes to rely\\n on to avoid a fearful, telescoping\\n collision. He flicked his wheel\\n smoothly to the right; but the\\n County Highway Commission\\n hadn\\'t yet tarred the traffic-loosened\\n gravel at the Bend.\\nAn incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures.\\nNed could scarcely have chosen\\n a worse place to start sliding and\\n spinning. His car hit the white-painted\\n wooden rail sideways,\\n crashed through, tumbled down\\n a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,\\n bounced up a little, and\\n arced outward, falling as gracefully\\n as a swan-diver toward the\\n inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet\\n beneath....\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious\\n when that black, quiet\\n pool geysered around him in a\\n mighty splash. He had only a\\n dazing welt on his forehead, and\\n a gag of terror in his throat.\\n\\n\\n Movement was slower now, as\\n he began to sink, trapped inside\\n his wrecked car. Nothing that he\\n could imagine could mean doom\\n more certainly than this. The Pit\\n was a tremendously deep pocket\\n in the ground, spring-fed. The\\n edges of that almost bottomless\\n pool were caked with a rim of\\n white—for the water, on which\\n dead birds so often floated, was\\n surcharged with alkali. As that\\n heavy, natronous liquid rushed\\n up through the openings and\\n cracks beneath his feet, Ned\\n Vince knew that his friends and\\n his family would never see his\\n body again, lost beyond recovery\\n in this abyss.\\n\\n\\n The car was deeply submerged.\\n The light had blinked out on the\\n dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute\\n darkness. A flood rushed\\n in at the shattered window. He\\n clawed at the door, trying to\\n open it, but it was jammed in\\n the crash-bent frame, and he\\n couldn\\'t fight against the force\\n of that incoming water. The\\n welt, left by the blow he had received\\n on his forehead, put a\\n thickening mist over his brain,\\n so that he could not think clearly.\\n Presently, when he could no\\n longer hold his breath, bitter\\n liquid was sucked into his lungs.\\n\\n\\n His last thoughts were those\\n of a drowning man. The machine-shop\\n he and his dad had\\n had in Harwich. Betty Moore,\\n with the smiling Irish eyes—like\\n in the song. Betty and he\\n had planned to go to the State\\n University this Fall. They\\'d\\n planned to be married sometime....\\n Goodbye, Betty ...\\n\\n\\n The ripples that had ruffled\\n the surface waters in the Pit,\\n quieted again to glassy smoothness.\\n The eternal stars shone\\n calmly. The geologic Dakota\\n hills, which might have seen the\\n dinosaurs, still bulked along the\\n highway. Time, the Brother of\\n Death, and the Father of\\n Change, seemed to wait....\\n\"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\\n\\n\\n The excited cry, which no human\\n throat could quite have duplicated\\n accurately, arose thinly\\n from the depths of a powder-dry\\n gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable\\n antiquity. The noon-day\\n Sun was red and huge. The\\n air was tenuous, dehydrated,\\n chill.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!...\"\\n\\n\\n At first there was only one\\n voice uttering those weird, triumphant\\n sounds. Then other\\n vocal organs took up that trilling\\n wail, and those short, sharp\\n chuckles of eagerness. Other\\n questioning, wondering notes\\n mixed with the cadence. Lacking\\n qualities identifiable as human,\\n the disturbance was still like the\\n babble of a group of workmen\\n who have discovered something\\n remarkable.\\n\\n\\n The desolate expanse around\\n the gulch, was all but without\\n motion. The icy breeze tore tiny\\n puffs of dust from grotesque,\\n angling drifts of soil, nearly\\n waterless for eons. Patches of\\n drab lichen grew here and there\\n on the up-jutting rocks, but in\\n the desert itself, no other life\\n was visible. Even the hills had\\n sagged away, flattened by incalculable\\n ages of erosion.\\nAt a mile distance, a crumbling\\n heap of rubble arose. Once\\n it had been a building. A gigantic,\\n jagged mass of detritus\\n slanted upward from its crest—red\\n debris that had once been\\n steel. A launching catapult for\\n the last space ships built by the\\n gods in exodus, perhaps it was—half\\n a million years ago. Man\\n was gone from the Earth. Glacial\\n ages, war, decadence, disease,\\n and a final scattering of those\\n ultimate superhumans to newer\\n worlds in other solar systems,\\n had done that.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n The sounds were not human.\\n They were more like the chatter\\n and wail of small desert animals.\\n\\n\\n But there was a seeming paradox\\n here in the depths of that\\n gulch, too. The glint of metal,\\n sharp and burnished. The flat,\\n streamlined bulk of a flying machine,\\n shiny and new. The bell-like\\n muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,\\n which seemed to\\n depend on a blast of atoms to\\n clear away rock and soil. Thus\\n the gulch had been cleared of the\\n accumulated rubbish of antiquity.\\n Man, it seemed, had a successor,\\n as ruler of the Earth.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological\\n expedition out from the\\n far lowlands to the east, out\\n from the city of Kar-Rah. And\\n he was very happy now—flushed\\n with a vast and unlooked-for\\n success.\\n\\n\\n He crouched there on his\\n haunches, at the dry bottom of\\n the Pit. The breeze rumpled his\\n long, brown fur. He wasn\\'t very\\n different in appearance from his\\n ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,\\n as he squatted there in that antique\\n stance of his kind. His tail\\n was short and furred, his undersides\\n creamy. White whiskers\\n spread around his inquisitive,\\n pink-tipped snout.\\n\\n\\n But his cranium bulged up and\\n forward between shrewd, beady\\n eyes, betraying the slow heritage\\n of time, of survival of the fittest,\\n of evolution. He could think and\\n dream and invent, and the civilization\\n of his kind was already\\n far beyond that of the ancient\\n Twentieth Century.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers\\n were gathered, tense and\\n gleeful, around the things their\\n digging had exposed to the daylight.\\n There was a gob of junk—scarcely\\n more than an irregular\\n formation of flaky rust. But imbedded\\n in it was a huddled form,\\n brown and hard as old wood. The\\n dry mud that had encased it\\n like an airtight coffin, had by\\n now been chipped away by the\\n tiny investigators; but soiled\\n clothing still clung to it, after\\n perhaps a million years. Metal\\n had gone into decay—yes. But\\n not this body. The answer to this\\n was simple—alkali. A mineral\\n saturation that had held time\\n and change in stasis. A perfect\\n preservative for organic tissue,\\n aided probably during most of\\n those passing eras by desert dryness.\\n The Dakotas had turned\\n arid very swiftly. This body was\\n not a mere fossil. It was a\\n mummy.\\n\"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.\\n Not the star-conquering demi-gods,\\n but the ancestral stock\\n that had built the first\\n machines on Earth, and in the\\n early Twenty-first Century, the\\n first interplanetary rockets. No\\n wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers\\n were happy in their\\n paleontological enthusiasm! A\\n strange accident, happening in a\\n legendary antiquity, had aided\\n them in their quest for knowledge.\\n\\n\\n At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,\\n chirping signal. The chant of\\n triumph ended, while instruments\\n flicked in his tiny hands.\\n The final instrument he used to\\n test the mummy, looked like a\\n miniature stereoscope, with complicated\\n details. He held it over\\n his eyes. On the tiny screen\\n within, through the agency of\\n focused X-rays, he saw magnified\\n images of the internal organs\\n of this ancient human\\n corpse.\\n\\n\\n What his probing gaze revealed\\n to him, made his pleasure\\n even greater than before. In\\n twittering, chattering sounds, he\\n communicated his further knowledge\\n to his henchmen. Though\\n devoid of moisture, the mummy\\n was perfectly preserved, even to\\n its brain cells! Medical and biological\\n sciences were far advanced\\n among Loy Chuk\\'s kind.\\n Perhaps, by the application of\\n principles long known to them,\\n this long-dead body could be\\n made to live again! It might\\n move, speak, remember its past!\\n What a marvelous subject for\\n study it would make, back there\\n in the museums of Kar-Rah!\\n\\n\\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n\\n\\n But Loy silenced this fresh,\\n eager chattering with a command.\\n Work was always more\\n substantial than cheering.\\nWith infinite care—small,\\n sharp hand-tools were used, now—the\\n mummy of Ned Vince was\\n disengaged from the worthless\\n rust of his primitive automobile.\\n With infinite care it was crated\\n in a metal case, and hauled into\\n the flying machine.\\n\\n\\n Flashing flame, the latter\\n arose, bearing the entire hundred\\n members of the expedition.\\n The craft shot eastward at bullet-like\\n speed. The spreading\\n continental plateau of North\\n America seemed to crawl backward,\\n beneath. A tremendous\\n sand desert, marked with low,\\n washed-down mountains, and the\\n vague, angular, geometric\\n mounds of human cities that\\n were gone forever.\\n\\n\\n Beyond the eastern rim of the\\n continent, the plain dipped downward\\n steeply. The white of dried\\n salt was on the hills, but there\\n was a little green growth here,\\n too. The dead sea-bottom of the\\n vanished Atlantic was not as\\n dead as the highlands.\\n\\n\\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,\\n the city of the rodents,\\n came into view—a crystalline\\n maze of low, bubble-like structures,\\n glinting in the red sunshine.\\n But this was only its surface\\n aspect. Loy Chuk\\'s people\\n had built their homes mostly underground,\\n since the beginning\\n of their foggy evolution. Besides,\\n in this latter day, the\\n nights were very cold, the shelter\\n of subterranean passages and\\n rooms was welcome.\\n\\n\\n The mummy was taken to Loy\\n Chuk\\'s laboratory, a short distance\\n below the surface. Here at\\n once, the scientist began his\\n work. The body of the ancient\\n man was put in a large vat.\\n Fluids submerged it, slowly\\n soaking from that hardened flesh\\n the alkali that had preserved it\\n for so long. The fluid was\\n changed often, until woody muscles\\n and other tissues became\\n pliable once more.\\n\\n\\n Then the more delicate processes\\n began. Still submerged in\\n liquid, the corpse was submitted\\n to a flow of restorative energy,\\n passing between complicated\\n electrodes. The cells of antique\\n flesh and brain gradually took on\\n a chemical composition nearer to\\n that of the life that they had\\n once known.\\nAt last the final liquid was\\n drained away, and the mummy\\n lay there, a mummy no more, but\\n a pale, silent figure in its tatters\\n of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,\\n metal-fabric helmet on its head,\\n and a second, much smaller helmet\\n on his own. Connected with\\n this arrangement, was a black\\n box of many uses. For hours he\\n worked with his apparatus,\\n studying, and guiding the recording\\n instruments. The time\\n passed swiftly.\\n\\n\\n At last, eager and ready for\\n whatever might happen now,\\n Loy Chuk pushed another switch.\\n With a cold, rosy flare, energy\\n blazed around that moveless\\n form.\\n\\n\\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity\\n ended like a gradual fading\\n mist. When he could see clearly\\n again, he experienced that inevitable\\n shock of vast change\\n around him. Though it had been\\n dehydrated, his brain had been\\n kept perfectly intact through the\\n ages, and now it was restored.\\n So his memories were as vivid as\\n yesterday.\\n\\n\\n Yet, through that crystalline\\n vat in which he lay, he could see\\n a broad, low room, in which he\\n could barely have stood erect. He\\n saw instruments and equipment\\n whose weird shapes suggested\\n alienness, and knowledge beyond\\n the era he had known! The walls\\n were lavender and phosphorescent.\\n Fossil bone-fragments were\\n mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur\\n bones, some of them\\n seemed, from their size. But\\n there was a complete skeleton of\\n a dog, too, and the skeleton of a\\n man, and a second man-skeleton\\n that was not quite human. Its\\n neck-vertebrae were very thick\\n and solid, its shoulders were\\n wide, and its skull was gigantic.\\n\\n\\n All this weirdness had a violent\\n effect on Ned Vince—a sudden,\\n nostalgic panic. Something\\n was fearfully wrong!\\n\\n\\n The nervous terror of the unknown\\n was on him. Feeble and\\n dizzy after his weird resurrection,\\n which he could not understand,\\n remembering as he did\\n that moment of sinking to certain\\n death in the pool at Pit\\n Bend, he caught the edge of the\\n transparent vat, and pulled himself\\n to a sitting posture. There\\n was a muffled murmur around\\n him, as of some vast, un-Earthly\\n metropolis.\\n\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\\n\\n\\n The words themselves, and the\\n way they were assembled, were\\n old, familiar friends. But the\\n tone was wrong. It was high,\\n shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.\\n Ned\\'s gaze searched for the\\n source of the voice—located the\\n black box just outside of his\\n crystal vat. From that box the\\n voice seemed to have originated.\\n Before it crouched a small,\\n brownish animal with a bulging\\n head. The animal\\'s tiny-fingered\\n paws—hands they were, really—were\\n touching rows of keys.\\n\\n\\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly\\n insane and incomprehensible.\\n A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,\\n a little; but plainly possessing\\n a high order of intelligence.\\n And a voice whose soothingly\\n familiar words were more repugnant\\n somehow, simply because\\n they could never belong in a\\n place as eerie as this.\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince did not know how\\n Loy Chuk had probed his brain,\\n with the aid of a pair of helmets,\\n and the black box apparatus. He\\n did not know that in the latter,\\n his language, taken from his\\n own revitalized mind, was recorded,\\n and that Loy Chuk had\\n only to press certain buttons to\\n make the instrument express his\\n thoughts in common, long-dead\\n English. Loy, whose vocal organs\\n were not human, would have had\\n great difficulty speaking English\\n words, anyway.\\n\\n\\n Ned\\'s dark hair was wildly\\n awry. His gaunt, young face\\n held befuddled terror. He gasped\\n in the thin atmosphere. \"I\\'ve\\n gone nuts,\" he pronounced with\\n a curious calm. \"Stark—starin\\'—nuts....\"\\nLoy\\'s box, with its recorded\\n English words and its sonic detectors,\\n could translate for its\\n master, too. As the man spoke,\\n Loy read the illuminated symbols\\n in his own language, flashed\\n on a frosted crystal plate before\\n him. Thus he knew what Ned\\n Vince was saying.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,\\n and the box reproduced his answer:\\n \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a\\n bit of it! There are just a lot of\\n things that you\\'ve got to get\\n used to, that\\'s all. You drowned\\n about a million years ago. I discovered\\n your body. I brought you\\n back to life. We have science\\n that can do that. I\\'m Loy\\n Chuk....\"\\nIt took only a moment for the\\n box to tell the full story in clear,\\n bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy\\n sought, with calm, human logic,\\n to make his charge feel at home.\\n Probably, though, he was a fool,\\n to suppose that he could succeed,\\n thus.\\n\\n\\n Vince started to mutter,\\n struggling desperately to reason\\n it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.\\n \"Speaking to me. One million\\n years. Evolution. The scientists\\n say that people grew up from\\n fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs\\n are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs\\n could come from\\n them. A lot easier than men\\n from fish....\"\\n\\n\\n It was all sound logic. Even\\n Ned Vince knew that. Still, his\\n mind, tuned to ordinary, simple\\n things, couldn\\'t quite realize all\\n the vast things that had happened\\n to himself, and to the\\n world. The scope of it all was too\\n staggeringly big. One million\\n years. God!...\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince made a last effort\\n to control himself. His knuckles\\n tightened on the edge of the vat.\\n \"I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been\\n talking about,\" he grated wildly.\\n \"But I want to get out of here!\\n I want to go back where I came\\n from! Do you understand—whoever,\\n or whatever you are?\"\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys.\\n \"But you can\\'t go back to the\\n Twentieth Century,\" said the\\n box. \"Nor is there any better\\n place for you to be now, than\\n Kar-Rah. You are the only man\\n left on Earth. Those men that\\n exist in other star systems are\\n not really your kind anymore,\\n though their forefathers originated\\n on this planet. They have\\n gone far beyond you in evolution.\\n To them you would be only a\\n senseless curiosity. You are\\n much better off with my people—our\\n minds are much more like\\n yours. We will take care of you,\\n and make you comfortable....\"\\n\\n\\n But Ned Vince wasn\\'t listening,\\n now. \"You are the only\\n man left on Earth.\" That had\\n been enough for him to hear. He\\n didn\\'t more than half believe it.\\n His mind was too confused for\\n conviction about anything. Everything\\n he saw and felt and\\n heard might be some kind of\\n nightmare. But then it might all\\n be real instead, and that was\\n abysmal horror. Ned was no\\n coward—death and danger of\\n any ordinary Earthly kind, he\\n could have faced bravely. But the\\n loneliness here, and the utter\\n strangeness, were hideous like\\n being stranded alone on another\\n world!\\n\\n\\n His heart was pounding heavily,\\n and his eyes were wide. He\\n looked across this eerie room.\\n There was a ramp there at the\\n other side, leading upward instead\\n of a stairway. Fierce impulse\\n to escape this nameless\\n lair, to try to learn the facts for\\n himself, possessed him. He\\n bounded out of the vat, and\\n with head down, dashed for the\\n ramp.\\nHe had to go most of the way\\n on his hands and knees, for the\\n up-slanting passage was low. Excited\\n animal chucklings around\\n him, and the occasional touch of\\n a furry body, hurried his feverish\\n scrambling. But he emerged\\n at last at the surface.\\n\\n\\n He stood there panting in that\\n frigid, rarefied air. It was night.\\n The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked\\n bulk. The constellations\\n were unrecognizable. The rodent\\n city was a glowing expanse of\\n shallow, crystalline domes, set\\n among odd, scrub trees and\\n bushes. The crags loomed on all\\n sides, all their jaggedness lost\\n after a million years of erosion\\n under an ocean that was gone.\\n In that ghastly moonlight, the\\n ground glistened with dry salt.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess it\\'s all true,\\n huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a\\n flat tone.\\n\\n\\n Behind him he heard an excited,\\n squeaky chattering. Rodents\\n in pursuit. Looking back,\\n he saw the pinpoint gleams of\\n countless little eyes. Yes, he\\n might as well be an exile on another\\n planet—so changed had the\\n Earth become.\\n\\n\\n A wave of intolerable homesickness\\n came over him as he\\n sensed the distances of time that\\n had passed—those inconceivable\\n eons, separating himself from\\n his friends, from Betty, from almost\\n everything that was familiar.\\n He started to run, away\\n from those glittering rodent\\n eyes. He sensed death in that\\n cold sea-bottom, but what of it?\\n What reason did he have left to\\n live? He\\'d be only a museum\\n piece here, a thing to be caged\\n and studied....\\n\\n\\n Prison or a madhouse would\\n be far better. He tried to get\\n hold of his courage. But what\\n was there to inspire it? Nothing!\\n He laughed harshly as he\\n ran, welcoming that bitter, killing\\n cold. Nostalgia had him in\\n its clutch, and there was no answer\\n in his hell-world, lost beyond\\n the barrier of the years....\\nLoy Chuk and his followers\\n presently came upon Ned Vince\\'s\\n unconscious form, a mile from\\n the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying\\n machine they took him back, and\\n applied stimulants. He came to,\\n in the same laboratory room as\\n before. But he was firmly\\n strapped to a low platform this\\n time, so that he could not escape\\n again. There he lay, helpless,\\n until presently an idea occurred\\n to him. It gave him a few crumbs\\n of hope.\\n\\n\\n \"Hey, somebody!\" he called.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'d better get some rest,\\n Ned Vince,\" came the answer\\n from the black box. It was Loy\\n Chuk speaking again.\\n\\n\\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.\\n \"You know a lot more than we\\n did in the Twentieth Century.\\n And—well—there\\'s that thing\\n called time-travel, that I used to\\n read about. Maybe you know how\\n to make it work! Maybe you\\n could send me back to my own\\n time after all!\"\\n\\n\\n Little Loy Chuk was in a\\n black, discouraged mood, himself.\\n He could understand the\\n utter, sick dejection of this\\n giant from the past, lost from\\n his own kind. Probably insanity\\n looming. In far less extreme circumstances\\n than this, death from\\n homesickness had come.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In\\n common with all real scientists,\\n regardless of the species from\\n which they spring, he loved the\\n subjects of his researches. He\\n wanted this ancient man to live\\n and to be happy. Or this creature\\n would be of scant value for\\n study.\\n\\n\\n So Loy considered carefully\\n what Ned Vince had suggested.\\n Time-travel. Almost a legend. An\\n assault upon an intangible wall\\n that had baffled far keener wits\\n than Loy\\'s. But he was bent,\\n now, on the well-being of this\\n anachronism he had so miraculously\\n resurrected—this human,\\n this Kaalleee....\\n\\n\\n Loy jabbed buttons on the\\n black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"\\n said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.\\n Perhaps that is the only\\n thing to do—to send you back\\n to your own period of history.\\n For I see that you will never be\\n yourself, here. It will be hard to\\n accomplish, but we\\'ll try. Now\\n I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned felt better immediately,\\n for there was real hope now,\\n where there had been none before.\\n Maybe he\\'d be back in his\\n home-town of Harwich again.\\n Maybe he\\'d see the old machine-shop,\\n there. And the trees greening\\n out in Spring. Maybe he\\'d\\n be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,\\n soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny\\n hypo-needle bit into his arm....\\n\\n\\n As soon as Ned Vince passed\\n into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk\\n went to work once more, using\\n that pair of brain-helmets again,\\n exploring carefully the man\\'s\\n mind. After hours of research,\\n he proceeded to prepare his\\n plans. The government of Kar-Rah\\n was a scientific oligarchy,\\n of which Loy was a prime member.\\n It would be easy to get the\\n help he needed.\\n\\n\\n A horde of small, grey-furred\\n beings and their machines, toiled\\n for many days.\\nNed Vince\\'s mind swam\\n gradually out of the blur that\\n had enveloped it. He was wandering\\n aimlessly about in a familiar\\n room. The girders of the\\n roof above were of red-painted\\n steel. His tool-benches were\\n there, greasy and littered with\\n metal filings, just as they had\\n always been. He had a tractor to\\n repair, and a seed-drill. Outside\\n of the machine-shop, the old,\\n familiar yellow sun was shining.\\n Across the street was the small\\n brown house, where he lived.\\n\\n\\n With a sudden startlement, he\\n saw Betty Moore in the doorway.\\n She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous\\n smile curved her lips.\\n As though she had succeeded in\\n creeping up on him, for a surprise.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.\\n \"You look as though you\\'ve been\\n dreaming, and just woke up!\"\\n\\n\\n He grimaced ruefully as she\\n approached. With a kind of fierce\\n gratitude, he took her in his\\n arms. Yes, she was just like\\n always.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I\\nwas\\ndreaming,\\n Betty,\" he whispered, feeling\\n that mighty sense of relief. \"I\\n must have fallen asleep at the\\n bench, here, and had a nightmare.\\n I thought I had an accident\\n at Pit Bend—and that a\\n lot of worse things happened....\\n But it wasn\\'t true ...\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince\\'s mind, over which\\n there was still an elusive fog that\\n he did not try to shake off, accepted\\n apparent facts simply.\\n\\n\\n He did not know anything\\n about the invisible radiations\\n beating down upon him, soothing\\n and dimming his brain, so that\\n it would never question or doubt,\\n or observe too closely the incongruous\\n circumstances that must\\n often appear. The lack of traffic\\n in the street without, for instance—and\\n the lack of people\\n besides himself and Betty.\\n\\n\\n He didn\\'t know that this machine-shop\\n was built from his\\n own memories of the original.\\n He didn\\'t know that this Betty\\n was of the same origin—a miraculous\\n fabrication of metal\\n and energy-units and soft plastic.\\n The trees outside were only\\n lantern-slide illusions.\\n\\n\\n It was all built inside a great,\\n opaque dome. But there were\\n hidden television systems, too.\\n Thus Loy Chuk\\'s kind could\\n study this ancient man—this\\n Kaalleee. Thus, their motives\\n were mostly selfish.\\n\\n\\n Loy, though, was not observing,\\n now. He had wandered far\\n out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to\\n ponder. He squeaked and chatted\\n to himself, contemplating the\\n magnificent, inexorable march of\\n the ages. He remembered the ancient\\n ruins, left by the final supermen.\\n\\n\\n \"The Kaalleee believes himself\\n home,\" Loy was thinking. \"He\\n will survive and be happy. But\\n there was no other way. Time is\\n an Eternal Wall. Our archeological\\n researches among the cities\\n of the supermen show the truth.\\n Even they, who once ruled Earth,\\n never escaped from the present\\n by so much as an instant....\"\\nTHE END\\nPRINTED IN U.

Svan was the leader making the final\\n\\n plans—plotting them a bit too well.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Winter 1944.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nThe Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock.\\n There was no reason why everything shouldn\\'t have been functioning\\n perfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the\\n same. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\\n lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\\n turned.\\n\\n\\n \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\\n\\n\\n The OD nodded. \"I\\'ll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\\n \"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\\n ready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \"\\nIf\\nthey come back.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Is there any question?\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec shrugged. \"I don\\'t know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny\\n place. I don\\'t trust the natives.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they\\'re human beings,\\n just like us—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don\\'t\\n even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don\\'t like them.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate\\n themselves to Venus\\'s climate. They\\'re friendly enough.\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\\n outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\\n Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\\n the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\\n proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\\n wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\\n guards.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there\\'s a minority who are afraid\\n of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\\n They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\\n know Venus is habitable. And there\\'s some sort of a paltry underground\\n group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\\n native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that\\n is—right down into the mud. Well—\" he laughed—\"maybe they will.\\n After all, the fittest survive. That\\'s a basic law of—\"\\n\\n\\n The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\\n voice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\\n reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\\n stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\\n enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He\\n snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\\n \"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\\n even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\\n and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\\n\\n\\n The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\\n\"You see?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\\n others in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\\n their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\\n\\n\\n The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\\n spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\\n head. \"Svan, I\\'m afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\\n is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\\n trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan laughed harshly. \"\\nThey\\ndon\\'t think so. You heard them. We are\\n not human any more. The officer said it.\"\\n\\n\\n The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\\n agreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\\n around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\\n convinced by Svan.\\n\\n\\n \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\\n assent.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\\n alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\\n Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\\n return.\"\\n\\n\\n An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\\n complained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\\n authorized—murder?\"\\n\\n\\n Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\\n Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\\n Earth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\\n object?\"\\n\\n\\n Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\\n dull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\\n feet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\\n ship. It will be set by means of this dial—\" he touched a spot on the\\n surface of the globe with a pallid finger—\"to do nothing for forty\\n hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.\"\\n\\n\\n He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\\n faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty,\\n irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\\n off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\\n mark on one of them, held it up.\\n\\n\\n \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\\n there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\\n\\n\\n No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\\n bowl.\"\\n\\n\\n Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\\n of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\\n left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\\n creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\\n with his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\\n and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\\n himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\\n slips.\\n\\n\\n Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\\n \"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\\n car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city\\n has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\\n find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\\n The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\\n car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\\n guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough,\\n after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that\\'s all there is to\\n it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\\n of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\\n dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\\n from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\\n\\n\\n There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\\n uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\\n\\n\\n Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\\n Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\\n striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\\n\\n\\n And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second\\'s\\n glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\\n Almost he was disappointed.\\n\\n\\n Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\\n up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\\n one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....\\n\\n\\n Then gray understanding came to him.\\nA traitor!\\nhis subconscious\\n whispered.\\nA coward!\\nHe stared at them in a new light, saw their\\n indecision magnified, became opposition.\\n\\n\\n Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\\n coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\\n be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\\n every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\\n of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\\n Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\\n beneath the table, marked his own slip.\\n\\n\\n In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\\n secret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\\nThe six conspirators in Svan\\'s old ground car moved slowly along the\\n main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except\\n for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the\\n entrance to the town\\'s Hall of Justice.\\n\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Svan, observing them. \"The delegation is still here. We\\n have ample time.\"\\n\\n\\n He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching\\n the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.\\n Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?\\n\\n\\n The right answer leaped up at him.\\nThey all are\\n, he thought.\\nNot one\\n of them understands what this means. They\\'re afraid.\\nHe clamped his lips. \"Go faster, Ingra,\" he ordered the girl who was\\n driving. \"Let\\'s get this done with.\"\\n\\n\\n She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her\\n eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy\\n car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite\\n dark now. The car\\'s driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,\\n illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the\\n jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The\\n present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off\\n again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.\\n\\n\\n A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence\\n that followed its thunderous crash, a man\\'s voice bellowed: \"Halt!\"\\n\\n\\n The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the\\n brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them\\n from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.\\n\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" he growled.\\n\\n\\n Svan spoke up. \"We want to look at the Earth-ship,\" he said. He opened\\n the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. \"We heard\\n it was leaving tonight,\" he continued, \"and we have not seen it. Is\\n that not permitted?\"\\n\\n\\n The guard shook his head sourly. \"No one is allowed near the ship. The\\n order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. \"It\\n is urgent,\" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a\\n complicated gesture. \"Do you understand?\"\\n\\n\\n Confusion furrowed the guard\\'s hairless brows, then was replaced by\\n a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. \"The Council!\" he roared.\\n \"By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—\"\\n He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was\\n faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.\\n He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against\\n the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan\\n savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like\\n nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength\\n in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial\\n advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard\\n lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had\\n ruthlessly pounded it against the road.\\nSvan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.\\nSvan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the\\n petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,\\n then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over\\n the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the\\n jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be\\n no trace.\\n\\n\\n Svan strode back to the car. \"Hurry up,\" he gasped to the girl. \"Now\\n there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep\\n a watch for other guards.\"\\nVenus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.\\n Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow\\n of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.\\n\\n\\n \"Can\\'t see a thing,\" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away\\n at the computer\\'s table. \"Look—are those lights over there?\"\\n\\n\\n The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. \"Probably the guards. Of\\n course, you can\\'t tell. Might be a raiding party.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no\\n answer in his stolid face. \"Don\\'t joke about it,\" he said. \"Suppose\\n something happens to the delegation?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then we\\'re in the soup,\" the Exec said philosophically. \"I told you\\n the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They\\'ve been prohibited for the\\n last three hundred years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It isn\\'t all the natives,\" Lowry said. \"Look how they\\'ve doubled the\\n guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they\\n know how. You heard the delegation\\'s report on the intercom. It\\'s this\\n secret group they call the Council.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And how do you know the guards themselves don\\'t belong to it?\" the\\n Exec retorted. \"They\\'re all the same to me.... Look, your light\\'s gone\\n out now. Must have been the guard. They\\'re on the wrong side to be\\n coming from the town, anyhow....\"\\nSvan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the\\n lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment\\n under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get\\n the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.\\n Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been\\ntwo\\nbombs in\\n the compartment, though Svan\\'s hand emerged with only one.\\n\\n\\n He got out of the car, holding the sphere. \"This will do for me,\" he\\n said. \"They won\\'t be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we\\n were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?\"\\n\\n\\n Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. \"We must circle back\\n again,\" she parroted. \"We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car\\n into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.\"\\n\\n\\n Svan, listening, thought:\\nIt\\'s not much of a plan. The guards would\\n not be drawn away. I am glad I can\\'t trust these five any more. If\\n they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a\\n purpose.\\nAloud, he said, \"You understand. If I get through, I will return to the\\n city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because\\n the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,\\n you are in no danger from the guards.\"\\nFrom the guards\\n, his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would\\n feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in\\n that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a\\n ground-shaking crash.\\n\\n\\n Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting\\n off the seconds. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"I will wait here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Svan.\" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached\\n for him, kissed him. \"Good luck to you, Svan,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n \"Good luck,\" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of\\n the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,\\n sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few\\n hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.\\n\\n\\n Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?\\n Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?\\n\\n\\n There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was\\n driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And\\n since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked\\n slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.\\n\\n\\n He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the\\n jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed\\n lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by\\n its own fierce rockets. Svan\\'s mist-trained eyes spotted the circling\\n figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship\\'s own.\\n They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those\\n slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the\\n side of the ship.\\n\\n\\n Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.\\n He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went\\n absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He\\n turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first\\n cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?\\nHe became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car\\n was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare\\n of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.\\n\\n\\n Paralyzed, he heard the girl\\'s voice. \"Svan! They\\'re coming! They found\\n the guard\\'s rifle, and they\\'re looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,\\n with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came\\n for you. We must flee!\"\\n\\n\\n He stared unseeingly at the light. \"Go away!\" he croaked unbelievingly.\\n Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb\\n in the car—\\n\\n\\n \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and\\n swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before\\n something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted\\n from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force\\n onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the\\n sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to\\n feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\\n\\n\\n The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He\\'s still alive,\" he said\\n callously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won\\'t last long, though.\\n What\\'ve you got there?\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two\\n halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a\\n connection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type,\\n delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,\\n and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won\\'t do any bombing\\n now.\"\\n\\n\\n Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.\\n The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It\\'s poetic justice if I ever saw it.\\n They had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of\\n paper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don\\'t get,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on\\n it? What about it?\"\\n\\n\\n The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had\\n the devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over\\n slowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be\\n doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Flowers,\\n\\n had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\\n\\n hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\\n\\n And the danger from the villain of the piece\\n\\n didn\\'t worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.\\n\\n\\n \u001B[0m\u001B[32m[\u001B[0m\u001B[32mTranscriber\\'s Note: This etext was produced from\\n\\n Planet Stories Fall 1944.\\n\\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\n\\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\u001B[0m\u001B[32m]\u001B[0m\u001B[32m\\nI was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\\nSpacemen\\'s Club\\nin Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\\n shoulder.\\n\\n\\n \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\\n thee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\\n\\n\\n A woman here...! The\\nSpacemen\\'s\\nwas a sanctuary, a rest club where\\n in-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\\n voyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\\n enforced.\\n\\n\\n I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\\n lounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie!\\n\\n\\n There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\\n on her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\\n voluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\\n tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\\n planted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\\n calm defiance.\\n\\n\\n I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\\n haven\\'t seen you in two years.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\\n fish-face to shut up.\"\\n\\n\\n The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\\n friend of yourth, you\\'ll have to take her away. It\\'th abtholutely\\n againth the ruleth....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we\\'ll go into the grille. There\\'s no\\n one there at this hour.\"\\n\\n\\n In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey\\n and Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed\\n the drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\\n\\n\\n \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don\\'t you know women aren\\'t\\n allowed in the\\nSpacemen\\'s\\n? What happened to the book you were\\n writing?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\\n this place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that\\'s what\\n they are. Anyway, I\\'ve been thrown out of better places.\"\\n\\n\\n She hadn\\'t changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\\n Annabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\\n But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year\\'s\\n hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\\n in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\\n\\n\\n But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\\n more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\\n sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\\n\\n\\n One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\\n novels, but they weren\\'t synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\\n novel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\\n and hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\\n expeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\\n\\n\\n She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\\n\\n\\n \"What happened to\\nGuns for Ganymede\\n?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\\n your last, wasn\\'t it?\"\\nGrannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\\n rolled herself a cigarette.\\n\\n\\n \"It wasn\\'t\\nGuns\\n, it was\\nPistols\\n; and it wasn\\'t\\nGanymede\\n, it was\\nPluto\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n I grinned. \"All complete, I\\'ll bet, with threats against the universe\\n and beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can\\'t have\\n your hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\\n\\n\\n Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\\n feet.\\n\\n\\n \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I\\'m due at the\\nSatellite\\nTheater in ten\\n minutes. Come on, you\\'re going with me.\"\\n\\n\\n Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\\n the jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\\n drew up before the big doors of the\\nSatellite\\n.\\n\\n\\n They don\\'t go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\\n colonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\\n muck,\\nzilcon\\nwood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\\n packed with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity\\n that made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\\n\\n\\n In front was a big sign. It read:\\nONE NIGHT ONLY\\n\\n DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\\n\\n NINE GENIUSES\\n\\n THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\\n\\n THE SYSTEM\\n\\n\\n As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\\n tinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\\n front row.\\n\\n\\n \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I\\'m sorry about all this rush, but I\\'m one of\\n the players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we\\'ll go\\n somewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\\n stage steps and disappeared in the wings.\\n\\n\\n \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She\\'ll be the death of me\\n yet.\"\\n\\n\\n The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\\n stage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\\n sat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\\n Mercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\\n uncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\\n improved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\\n Earthman operator.\\nA tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\\n advanced to the footlights.\\n\\n\\n \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\\n myself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a roar of applause from the\\nSatellite\\naudience. When it had\\n subsided, the man continued:\\n\\n\\n \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\\n to give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\\n nine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\\n sets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\\n These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\\n question missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\\nplanetoles\\n.\\n\\n\\n \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\\n her wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\\n science fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\\n\\n\\n From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\\n on the dais.\\n\\n\\n The Doctor\\'s program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\\n dials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\\n coalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\\n voice echoed through the theater:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nWho was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\\n\"\\n\\n\\n Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\\n hand. She said quietly:\\n\\n\\n \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\\n tracto-car.\"\\n\\n\\n And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\\n the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\\n cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\\n bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\\n or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\\n the winner.\\n\\n\\n It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\\n brought me here. And then I began to notice things.\\n\\n\\n The audience in the\\nSatellite\\nseemed to have lost much of its\\n original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\\n signal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\\n\\n\\n Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\\n general surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\\n were turned in a smile of satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\\n crowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\\n occurred.\\n\\n\\n A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\\n dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\\n unpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\\n the Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\\n an earlier era.\\n\\n\\n Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\\n man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\\n was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\\n snipped the Martian\\'s single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\\n into his mouth.\\n\\n\\n Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\\n rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\\n shout derisive epithets.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\\n and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\\n THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\\n was all but deserted.\\n\\n\\n In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\\n eyes.\\n\\n\\n \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\\n\\n\\n I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I\\'ve ever seen. The I.P. men\\n ought to clamp down.\"\\n\\n\\n \"The I.P. men aren\\'t strong enough.\"\\n\\n\\n She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\\n line about her usually smiling lips.\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\nFor a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\\n closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\\n\\n\\n \"My last book,\\nDeath In The Atom\\n, hit the stands last January,\"\\n she began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months\\'\\n vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\\n Well, I\\'d used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\\n for this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\\n weeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\\n Karn....\"\\n\\n\\n \"Who?\" I interrupted.\\n\\n\\n \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\\n Varsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\\n his adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\\n asked abruptly.\\n\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\\n\\n\\n \"It\\'s not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\\n rock once found on Mercury. The\\nAlpha\\nrays of this rock are similar\\n to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\\n projected at high speed. But the character of the\\nGamma\\nrays has\\n never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\\n electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\\nBeta\\nor cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\\n\\n\\n \"When any form of life is exposed to these\\nGamma\\nrays from the Green\\n Flame rock, they produce in the creature\\'s brain a certain lassitude\\n and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\\n develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\\n guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\\n intolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\\n a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\\n\\n\\n I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman\\'s every word.\\n\\n\\n \"Now in 2710, as you\\'d know if you studied your history, the three\\n planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\\n cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\\n enough to endanger all civilized life.\\n\\n\\n \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\\n government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\\n ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\\n immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\\n followed.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\\n\\n\\n \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\\n old prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\\n travels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\\n an old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\\n Flames!\"\\n\\n\\n If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\\n I said, \"So what?\"\\n\\n\\n \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\\n if it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\\n after the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\\n existence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there\\'d be trouble.\\n\\n\\n \"Of course, I regarded Karn\\'s story as a wild dream, but it made\\n corking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\\n it was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\\n Earth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you\\'ve come to the\\n conclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\\n attempting to put your plot into action.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That\\'s exactly what I think.\"\\n\\n\\n I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\\n and laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who\\'s\\n your thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\\n\\n\\n She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\\n\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n\\n \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\\n\\n\\n The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\\n quiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\\n happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\\n police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\\n representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\\n dictator to step in.\\n\\n\\n \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\\n single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\\n my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\\n times more potent and is transmiting it\\nen masse\\n.\"\\n\\n\\n If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\\n have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\\n approaching danger.\\n\\n\\n \"Let\\'s get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\\nZinnng-whack!\\n\"All right!\"\\n\\n\\n On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\\n appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie\\'s head the\\n fresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\\n\\n\\n A heat ray!\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\\n door. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\\n woman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\\n threw over the starting stud.\\n\\n\\n An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\\nSix days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\\n outpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\\n the eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\\n water. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\\n sky like puffs of cotton.\\n\\n\\n We had traveled this far by\\nganet\\n, the tough little two headed pack\\n animal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\\n had its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\\n belt that encircled the planet\\'s equator. Now our drivers changed to\\n boatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\\njagua\\ncanoes.\\n\\n\\n It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\\n confidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\\n\\n\\n \"We\\'re heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\\n Ezra Karn so much the better. If we don\\'t, we follow his directions to\\n the lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\\n see, I\\'m positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\\n ship.\"\\n\\n\\n Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\\n tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\\n steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\\n just before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\\n that broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\\n isolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\\n given me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\\n coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\\n representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\\n to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\\n\\n\\n Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\\n tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\\n Grannie\\'s incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\\n which she had skilfully blended into a novel?\\n\\n\\n Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\\n place a ringing silence blanketed everything.\\n\\n\\n And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\\n undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\\n it advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\\n It charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\\n There was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\\n talons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\\n missing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\\n\\n\\n From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\\n appeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\\n\\n\\n \"Stand still!\"\\n\\n\\n The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\\n again. This time the old woman\\'s heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\\n purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\\n air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\\n ground and shot aloft.\\nGrannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\\nI stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\\n\\n\\n \"In heaven\\'s name, what was it?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\\n in the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\\n trained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\\n and follows with a relentless purpose.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Then that would mean...?\"\\n\\n\\n \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\\n cafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\\n tent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\\n being watched. From now on it\\'s the survival of the fittest.\"\\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\\n resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\\n ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\\n surface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\\n the swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\\n multi-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\\n The Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\\n hand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\\n a matter of seconds.\\n\\n\\n At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\\n of the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\\n jetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\\n\\n\\n He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\\n unkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\\n dressed in\\nvarpa\\ncloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\\n head was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\\n\\n\\n \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\\n Flowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\\n hut.\\n\\n\\n The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\\n type of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\\n civilization entirely.\\n\\n\\n Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\\n object of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\\n\\n\\n \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\\n find that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\\n cigarette. \"You know where it is, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\\n Varsoom country, and that isn\\'t exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\\n\\n\\n \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\\n\\n\\n Karn shook his head. \"They\\'re a form of life that\\'s never been seen by\\n Earthmen. Strictly speaking, they\\'re no more than a form of energy.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Dangerous?\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\\n of myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\\n because I was alone, and they didn\\'t notice me, and Darthier escaped\\n because he made \\'em laugh.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n \"That\\'s right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\\n that\\'s manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\\n laugh, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\\n Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\\n Several mold guns were borrowed from the prospector\\'s supply to arm the\\n Venusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\\n\\n\\n \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain\\'t missed one in months.\\n You gotta wait \\'til I hear it.\"\\n\\n\\n Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\\n flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\\n chair, listening with avid interest.\\n\\n\\n It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\\n heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\\n again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\\n and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\\n screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\\n my thoughts far away.\\nHalf an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\\n were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\\n camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\\n about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\\n despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\\n futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\\n from turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\\n that all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\\n\\n\\n After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\\n steaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\\n advance on foot.\\n\\n\\n It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\\n suddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\\n There it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\\narelium\\nsteel,\\n half buried in the swamp soil.\\n\\n\\n \"What\\'s that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\\n\\n\\n A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\\n quarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\\n suspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\\n insulators.\\n\\n\\n Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\\n Venusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\\n circle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\\n\\n\\n But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\\n Moments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\\n\\n\\n A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\\n Mid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\\n\\n\\n \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\\n climb slowly.\\n\\n\\n The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\\n There was no sign of life.\\n\\n\\n \"Somebody\\'s gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\\n\\n\\n Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\\n left side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\\n bare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\\n clarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\\n looked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\\n swing slowly to and fro.\\n\\n\\n Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\\n the lower hold are probably exposed to a\\ntholpane\\nplate and their\\n radiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\\n\\n\\n Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\\n glass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\\n\\n\\n \"You\\'ll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\\n atomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\\n guards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let\\'s see if the\\n Green Flames are more accessible.\"\\n\\n\\n In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\\n the feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\\n vessel\\'s hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\\n Suspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\\n plate.\\n\\n\\n But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\\n\\n\\n Grannie stamped her foot. \"It\\'s maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\\n the crux of the whole matter, and we\\'re powerless to make a single\\n move.\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

But its outward perils could not compare\\n with the Ryzgas themselves, who slept within, ready to wake and\\n conquer....\\nAt sunset they were in sight of the Ryzga mountain. Strangely it towered\\n among the cliffs and snow-slopes of the surrounding ranges: an immense\\n and repellently geometric cone, black, its sides blood-tinted by the\\n dying sun.\\n\\n\\n Neena shivered, even though the surrounding cold could not reach her.\\n The ice-wind blew from the glacier, but Var\\'s love was round her as a\\n warming cloak, a cloak that glowed softly golden in the deepening\\n twilight, even as her love was about him.\\n\\n\\n Var said, \"The Watcher\\'s cave should be three miles beyond this pass.\"\\n He stood rigid, trying to catch an echo of the Watcher\\'s thoughts, but\\n there was nothing. Perhaps the old man was resting. From the other\\n direction, the long way that they two had come, it was not difficult to\\n sense the thought of Groz. That thought was powerful, and heavy with\\n vengeance.\\n\\n\\n \"Hurry,\" said Neena. \"They\\'re closer than they were an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\\n She was beautiful and defiant, facing the red sunset and the black\\n mountain. Var sensed her fear, and the love that had conquered it. He\\n felt a wave of tenderness and bitterness. For him she had come to this.\\n For the flame that had sprung between them at the Truce of New Grass,\\n she had challenged the feud of their peoples and had left her home, to\\n follow him. Now, if her father and his kinsmen overtook them, it would\\n be death for Var, and for Neena living shame. Which of the two was worse\\n was no longer a simple problem to Var, who had grown much older in the\\n last days.\\n\\n\\n \"Wait,\" he commanded. While she waited he spun a dream, attaching it to\\n the crags that loomed over the pass, and to the frozen ground underfoot.\\n It was black night, as it would really be when Groz and his henchmen\\n reached this place; lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga mountain, and\\n strange lights dipped above it; and for good measure there was an\\n avalanche in the dream, and hideous beasts rushed snapping and ravening\\n from the crevices of the rock.\\n\\n\\n \"Oh!\" cried Neena in involuntary alarm.\\n\\n\\n Var sighed, shaking his head. \"It won\\'t hold them for long, but it\\'s the\\n best I can do now. Come on.\"\\n\\n\\n There was no path. Now they were descending the steeper face of the\\n sierra, and the way led over bottomless crevasses, sheer drops and sheer\\n ascents, sheets of traitorous glare ice. Place after place had to be\\n crossed on the air, and both grew weary with the effort such crossings\\n cost. They hoarded their strength, helping one another; one alone might\\n never have won through.\\n\\n\\n It was starry night already when they saw the light from the Watcher\\'s\\n cave. The light shone watery and dim from beneath the hoary back of the\\n glacier, and as they came nearer they saw why: the cave entrance was\\n sealed by a sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that fell motionless from\\n the rocks above. They heard no sound.\\n\\n\\n The two young people stared for a long minute, intrigued and fearful.\\n Both had heard of this place, and the ancient who lived there to keep\\n watch on the Ryzga mountain, as a part of the oldest legends of their\\n childhood; but neither had been here before.\\n\\n\\n But this was no time for shyness. Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to\\n make sure that it was real, not dream-stuff; then he struck it boldly\\n with his fist. It shattered and fell in a rain of splinters, sparkling\\n in the light that poured from within.\\nThey felt the Watcher rouse, heard his footsteps, and finally saw him—a\\n shrunken old man, white-haired, with a lined beardless face. The sight\\n of him, more marred by age than anyone they had ever seen before, was\\n disappointing. They had expected something more—an ancient giant, a\\n tower of wisdom and strength. The Watcher was four hundred years old;\\n beside him even Groz, who had always seemed so ancient, was like a boy.\\n\\n\\n The Watcher peered at them in turn. \"Welcome,\" he said in a cracked\\n voice. He did not speak again; the rest of his conversation was in\\n thought only. \"Welcome indeed. I am too much alone here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You were asleep!\" said Var. Shock made his thought accusing, though he\\n had not meant to be.\\n\\n\\n The old man grinned toothlessly. \"Never fear. Asleep or awake, I watch.\\n Come in! You\\'re letting in the wind.\"\\n\\n\\n Inside the cave it was warm as summer. Var saw with some surprise that\\n all the walls were sheathed in ice—warm to the touch, bound fast\\n against melting by the Watcher\\'s will. Light blazed in reflections from\\n the ice walls, till there was no shadow in the place. Behind them began\\n a tinkling of falling water, thawed from the glacial ridges above to\\n descend sheet-wise over the cave mouth, freezing as it fell into\\n lengthening icicles. The old man gazed at his work for a moment, then\\n turned questioningly to the young pair.\\n\\n\\n \"We need a little rest out of the cold,\" said Var. \"And food, if you can\\n spare it. We\\'re pursued.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. You shall have what I can give you. Make yourselves\\n comfortable, and in one minute.... Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world\\n is as bad as it was when I was last in it.\"\\n\\n\\n Hot food and drink were before them almost at once. The Watcher regarded\\n them with compassion as their eyes brightened and some of the shadow of\\n weariness lifted from them. \"You have stolen your enemy\\'s daughter, no\\n doubt, young man? Such things happened when I was young.\"\\n\\n\\n Warming to the old man now, Var sketched his and Neena\\'s history\\n briefly. \"We should have been safe among my people by now. And before\\n very long, I\\'m sure, I would have performed some deed which Groz would\\n recognize as a worthy exploit, and would thus have healed the feud\\n between our families. But our flight was found out too soon. They cut us\\n off and forced us into the mountains, and now they are only a few hours\\n behind us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"A pity, indeed. I would like to help you—but, you understand, I am the\\n Mountain Watcher. I must be above feuds and families.\"\\n\\n\\n Var nodded somberly, thinking that an old recluse would in any case be\\n able to do little for them against Groz and his violent kinsfolk.\\n\\n\\n \"And what will you do now?\"\\n\\n\\n Var grinned mirthlessly. \"We haven\\'t much choice, since they\\'re\\n overtaking us. I have only one idea left: we can go where Groz may fear\\n to follow us.\"\\n\\n\\n \"To the mountain, you mean.\"\\n\\n\\n \"And into it, if need be.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher was broodingly silent; his eyes shifted to Neena, where she\\n nestled by Var\\'s side. He asked, \"And you—are you willing to follow\\n your lover in this?\"\\n\\n\\n Neena returned his gaze without flinching; then she looked sidelong at\\n Var, and her lips curled with a proud and tender mockery. \"Follow? Why,\\n I will lead, if his courage should fail him.\"\\nThe old man said, \"It is no part of my duty to dissuade you from this\\n thing. You are free persons. But I must be sure that you know what you\\n are doing. That is the second part of the law the First Watcher made: to\\n guard lest the unwary and the ignorant should bring harm on themselves\\n and on all men.\"\\n\\n\\n \"We know the stories,\" Var said brusquely. \"In the hollow heart of their\\n mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as they chose to do when their world\\n crumbled. But if they are wakened, the mountain will tremble, and the\\n Ryzgas will come forth.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Do you believe that?\"\\n\\n\\n \"As one believes stories.\"\\n\\n\\n \"It is true,\" said the Watcher heavily. \"In my youth I penetrated\\n farther into the mountain than anyone before, farther even than did the\\n First Watcher. I did not see the sleepers, nor will any man until they\\n come again, but I met their sentries, the sentinel machines that guard\\n them now as they have for two thousand years. When I had gone that far,\\n the mountain began to shake, the force that is in the Earth rumbled\\n below, and I returned in time.\" Now for the first time Var sensed the\\n power in the old man\\'s look, the power of four hundred years\\' wisdom.\\n Var stared down at his hands.\\n\\n\\n \"The Ryzgas also were men,\" said the Watcher. \"But they were such a race\\n as the world has not seen before or since. There were tyrannies before\\n the Ryzgas, there was lust for power, and atrocious cruelty; but such\\n tyranny, power, and cruelty as theirs, had never been known. They ruled\\n the Earth for four generations, and the Earth was too little for them.\\n They laid the world waste, stripped it of metals and fuels and bored to\\n its heart for energy, poisoned its seas and its air with the fume of\\n their works, wrung its peoples dry for their labor ... and in each of\\n those four generations they launched a ship of space. They were great\\n and evil as no other people has been, because they wanted the stars.\\n\\n\\n \"Because of them we must build with dreams instead of iron, and our only\\n fire is that of the Sun, and even now, two thousand years later, the\\n Earth is still slowly recovering from the pangs and poison of that age.\\n If you turn up the sod in the plain where the wild herds graze, you will\\n find numberless fragments of rusted or corroded metal, bits of glass and\\n strange plastic substances, debris of artifacts still showing the marks\\n of their shaping—the scattered wreckage of the things they made. And\\n we—we too are a remnant, the descendants of the few out of all humanity\\n that survived when the Ryzgas\\' world went down in flame and thunder.\\n\\n\\n \"In the last generation of their power the Ryzgas knew by their science\\n that the race of man would endure them no longer. They made ready their\\n weapons, they mined the cities and the factories for destruction, making\\n sure that their works and their knowledge would perish with them.\\n Meanwhile they redoubled the yoke and the punishments, hastening the\\n completion of the last of the starships.\\n\\n\\n \"From the memories that the old Watchers have left here, and from the\\n memories of dead men that still echo in the air, I have gathered a\\n picture of that world\\'s end. I will show it to you....\"\\nVar and Neena stared, unstirring, with wide vacant eyes, while the old\\n man wove a dream around them, and the bright ice-cave faded from their\\n vision, and they saw—\\n\\n\\n Black starless night, a sky of rolling smoke above the greatest city\\n that was ever built. Only the angry light of fires relieved the city\\'s\\n darkness—that, and the blue-white lightning flashes that silhouetted\\n the naked skeletons of buildings and were followed by thunder and a\\n shaking of the earth.\\n\\n\\n Along lightless streets, half choked with rubble and with the dead,\\n poured a mad, hating horde. The recurrent flashes lit scarred faces,\\n naked bodies blackened and maimed from the hell of the workshops where\\n the Ryzgas\\' might had been forged, eyes that stared white and half\\n sightless from the glare of the furnaces, gnarled hands that now at long\\n last clutched the weapons of the last rebellion—a rebellion without\\n hope of new life on a world gutted and smoldering from the fulfilment of\\n the Ryzgas\\' dream, without slogans other than a cry for blood.\\n\\n\\n Before them death waited around the citadel where the masters still\\n fought. All round, from the lowest and most poisonous levels of the\\n shattered city, the slaves swarmed up in their millions. And the\\n lightning blazed, and the city howled and screamed and burned.\\n\\n\\n Then, unbelievably, the thunder fell silent, and the silence swept\\n outward like a wave, from ruined street to street. The mouths that had\\n shouted their wrath were speechless, and the rage-blinded eyes were\\n lifted in sudden awe. From the center, over the citadel, an immense\\n white globe soared upward, rising swiftly without sound.\\n\\n\\n They had never seen its like, but they knew. It was the last starship,\\n and it was leaving.\\n\\n\\n It poised motionless. For an instant the burning city lay mute; then the\\n millions found voice. Some roared ferocious threats and curses; others\\n cried desolately—\\nwait!\\nThen the whole city, the dark tumuli of its buildings and its leaping\\n fires and tormented faces, and the black sky over it, seemed to twist\\n and swim, like a scene under water when a great fish sweeps past, and\\n the ship was gone.\\n\\n\\n The stunned paralysis fell apart in fury. Flame towered over the\\n citadel. The hordes ran and shrieked again toward the central inferno,\\n and the city burned and burned....\\nVar blinked dazedly in the shadowless glow of the ice-cave. His arm\\n tightened about Neena till she gasped. He was momentarily uncertain that\\n he and she were real and here, such had been the force of the dream, a\\n vision of such scope and reality as Var had never seen—no, lived\\n through—before. With deep respect now he gazed upon the bent old man\\n who was the Mountain Watcher.\\n\\n\\n \"Some of the Ryzgas took flight to the stars, and some perished on\\n Earth. But there was a group of them who believed that their time to\\n rule would come again. These raised a black mountain from the Earth\\'s\\n heart, and in hollows within it cast themselves into deathless sleep,\\n their deathless and lifeless sentinels round them, to wait till someone\\n dare arouse them, or until their chosen time—no one knows surely.\\n\\n\\n \"I have told you the story you know, and have shown you a glimpse of the\\n old time, because I must make sure that you do not approach the mountain\\n in ignorance. Our world is unwise and sometimes evil, full of arrogance,\\n folly, and passion that are in the nature of man. Yet it is a happy\\n world, compared to that the Ryzgas made and will make again.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher eyed them speculatively. \"Before all,\" he said finally,\\n \"this is a world where you are free to risk wakening the old tyrants, if\\n in your own judgment your great need renders the chance worth taking.\"\\n\\n\\n Neena pressed her face against Var\\'s shoulder, hiding her eyes. In her\\n mind as it groped for his there was a confusion of horror and pity. Var\\n looked grimly at the Watcher, and would have spoken; but the Watcher\\n seemed suddenly a very long way off, and Var could no longer feel his\\n own limbs, his face was a numb mask. Dully he heard the old man say,\\n \"You are tired. Best sleep until morning.\"\\n\\n\\n Var strove to cry out that there was no time, that Groz was near and\\n that sleep was for infants and the aged, but his intention sank and\\n drowned under wave upon wave of unconquerable languor. The bright cave\\n swam and dissolved; his eyelids closed.\\nVar woke. Daylight glimmered through the ice of the cave mouth. He had\\n been unconscious, helpless, for hours! At the thought of that, panic\\n gripped him. He had not slept since childhood, and he had forgotten how\\n it was.\\n\\n\\n He came to his feet in one quick movement, realizing in that action that\\n sleep had refreshed his mind and body—realizing also that a footstep\\n had wakened him. Across the cave he faced a young man who watched him\\n coolly with dark piercing eyes that were familiar though he did not know\\n the face.\\n\\n\\n Neena sat up and stifled a cry of fright. Var growled, \"Who are you?\\n Where\\'s the Watcher?\"\\n\\n\\n The other flashed white teeth in a smile. \"I\\'m the Watcher,\" he\\n answered. \"Often I become a youth at morning, and relax into age as the\\n day passes. A foolish amusement, no doubt, but amusements are few here.\"\\n\\n\\n \"You made us fall asleep. Groz will be on us—\"\\n\\n\\n \"Groz and his people could not detect your thoughts as you slept. They\\n were all night chasing elusive dreams on the high ridges, miles away.\"\\n\\n\\n Var passed a hand across bewildered eyes. Neena said softly, \"Thank you,\\n Watcher.\"\\n\\n\\n \"Don\\'t thank me. I take no sides in your valley feuds. But now you are\\n rested, your minds are clear. Do you still mean to go on to the Ryzga\\n mountain?\"\\n\\n\\n Not looking at the Watcher, Var muttered unsteadily, \"We have no\\n alternative.\"\\n\\n\\n There was a liquid tinkling as the ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh\\n breeze of morning swept into the cave. The youth beckoned to them, and\\n they followed him outside.\\n\\n\\n The glacial slope on which the cavern opened faced toward the mountain.\\n It rose black and forbidding in the dawn as it had by sunset. To right\\n and left of it, the grand cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splendidly by\\n the morning sun, but the mountain of the Ryzgas drank in the light and\\n gave nothing back.\\n\\n\\n Below their feet the slope fell away into an opaque sea of fog, filling\\n a mile-wide gorge. There was a sound of turbulent water, of a river\\n dashed from rock to rock in its struggle toward the plain, but the\\n curling fog hid everything.\\n\\n\\n \"You have an alternative,\" said the Watcher crisply. The two took their\\n eyes from the black mountain and gazed at him in sudden hope, but his\\n face was unsmiling. \"It is this. You, Var, can flee up the canyon to the\\n north, by a way I will show you, disguising your thoughts and masking\\n your presence as well as you are able, while the girl goes in the other\\n direction, southward, without seeking to conceal herself. Your pursuers\\n will be deceived and follow her, and by the time they catch her it will\\n be too late for them to overtake Var.\"\\n\\n\\n That possibility had not occurred to them at all. Var and Neena looked\\n at one another. Then by common consent they blended their minds into\\n one.\\n\\n\\n They thought, in the warm intimacy of unreserved understanding: \"\\nIt\\n would work: I-you would make the sacrifice of shame and mockery—yet\\n these can be borne—that I-you might be saved from death—which is alone\\n irreparable.... But to become\\nI\\nand\\nyou\\nagain—that cannot be\\n borne.\\n\"\\n\\n\\n They said in unison, \"No. Not that.\"\\n\\n\\n The Watcher\\'s face did not change. He said gravely, \"Very well. I will\\n give you what knowledge I have that may help you when you enter the\\n Ryzga mountain.\"\\n\\n\\n Quickly, he impressed on them what he had learned of the structure of\\n the mountain and of its guardian machines. Var closed his eyes, a little\\n dizzied by the rapid flood of detail.\\n\\n\\n \"You are ready to go,\" said the Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his voice\\n was cracked and harsh. Var opened his eyes in surprise, and saw that the\\n Watcher had become again the hoary ancient of last night.\\n\\n\\n Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar emotion; only by its echo in Neena\\'s\\n mind did he recognize it as a sense of guilt. He said stiffly, \"You\\n don\\'t blame us?\"\\n\\n\\n \"You have taken life in your own hands,\" rasped the Watcher. \"Who does\\n that needs no blessing and feels no curse. Go!\"\\nThey groped through the fog above blank abysses that hid the snarling\\n river, crept hand in hand, sharing their strength, across unstable dream\\n bridges from crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in their numbers, would\\n cross the gorge more surely and swiftly. When Var and Neena set foot at\\n last on the cindery slope of the great volcanic cone, they sensed that\\n the pursuit already halved their lead.\\n\\n\\n They stood high on the side of the Ryzga mountain, and gazed at the\\n doorway. It was an opaque yet penetrable well of darkness, opening into\\n the face of a lava cliff, closed only by an intangible curtain—so\\n little had the Ryzgas feared those who might assail them in their sleep.\\n\\n\\n Var sent his thoughts probing beyond the curtain, listened intently,\\n head thrown back, to their echoes that returned. The tunnel beyond\\n slanted steeply downward. Var\\'s hands moved, molding a radiant globe\\n from the feeble sunshine that straggled through the fog-bank. With an\\n abrupt motion he hurled it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the darkness\\n had drunk it up, but though sight did not serve they both sensed that it\\n had passed through to light up the depths beyond. For within the\\n mountain something snapped suddenly alert—something alive yet not\\n living, seeing yet blind. They felt light-sensitive cells tingle in\\n response, felt electric currents sting along buried, long-idle\\n circuits....\\n\\n\\n The two stood shivering together.\\n\\n\\n The morning wind stirred, freshening, the fog lifted a little, and they\\n heard a great voice crying, \"There they are!\"\\n\\n\\n Var and Neena turned. Far out in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge that\\n they could not see, stood Groz. He shook the staff he carried. It was\\n too far to discern the rage that must contort his features, but the\\n thought he hurled at them was a soundless bellow: \"Young fools! I\\'ve\\n caught you now!\"\\n\\n\\n Behind Groz the figures of his followers loomed up as striding shadows.\\n Neena\\'s hand tightened on Var\\'s. Var sent a thought of defiance: \"Go\\n back! Or you\\'ll drive us to enter the mountain!\"\\n\\n\\n Groz seemed to hesitate. Then he swung his staff up like a weapon, and\\n for the two on the mountainside the world turned upside down, the\\n mountain\\'s black shoulder hung inverted above them and the dizzy gulf of\\n sky was beneath. Var fought for footing with his balance gone, feeling\\n Neena reel against him until, summoning all his strength, he broke the\\n grip of the illusion and the world seemed to right itself. The mist\\n billowed again and Groz was out of sight, but they could hear him\\n exhorting his men to haste.\\n\\n\\n Neena\\'s face was deadly pale and her lips trembled, but her urgent\\n whisper said, \"Come on!\"\\n\\n\\n Together they plunged into the curtain of darkness.\\nAt Var\\'s thought command Neena froze instantly. \"Feel that!\" he\\n muttered, and she, listening, sensed it too: the infinitesimal trickle\\n of currents behind what appeared to be a blank tunnel wall, a rising\\n potential that seemed to whisper\\nReady ... ready....\\nThe sun-globe floated behind them, casting light before them down the\\n featureless tunnel that sloped always toward the mountain\\'s heart. Var\\n summoned it, and it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a little more—\\n\\n\\n Between wall and wall a blinding spindle of flame sprang into being,\\n pulsed briefly with radiant energy that pained the eyes, and went out.\\n The immaterial globe of light danced on before them.\\n\\n\\n \"Forward, before the charge builds up again!\" said Var. A few feet\\n further on, they stumbled over a pile of charred bones. Someone else had\\n made it only this far. It was farther than the Watcher had gone into\\n these uncharted regions, and only the utmost alertness of mind and sense\\n had saved them from death in traps like this. But as yet the way was not\\n blocked....\\n\\n\\n Then they felt the mountain begin to tremble. A very faint and remote\\n vibration at first, then an increasingly potent shuddering of the floor\\n under their feet and the walls around them. Somewhere far below immense\\n energies were stirring for the first time in centuries. The power that\\n was in the Earth was rising; great wheels commenced to turn, the\\n mechanical servitors of the Ryzgas woke one by one and began to make\\n ready, while their masters yet slept, for the moment of rebirth that\\n might be near at hand.\\n\\n\\n From behind, up the tunnel, came a clear involuntary thought of dismay,\\n then a directed thought, echoing and ghostly in the confinement of the\\n dark burrow:\\n\\n\\n \"\\nStop!\\n—before you go too far!\"\\n\\n\\n Var faced that way and thought coldly: \"Only if you return and let us go\\n free.\"\\n\\n\\n In the black reaches of the shaft his will groped for and locked with\\n that of Groz, like the grip of two strong wrestlers. In that grip each\\n knew with finality that the other\\'s stubbornness matched his own—that\\n neither would yield, though the mountain above them and the world\\n outside should crumble to ruin around them.\\n\\n\\n \"Follow us, then!\"\\n\\n\\n They plunged deeper into the mountain. And the shaking of the mountain\\n increased with every step, its vibrations became sound, and its sound\\n was like that of the terrible city which they had seen in the dream.\\n Through the slow-rolling thunder of the hidden machines seemed to echo\\n the death-cries of a billion slaves, the despair of all flesh and blood\\n before their monstrous and inhuman power.\\n\\n\\n Without warning, lights went on. Blinking in their glare, Var and Neena\\n saw that fifty paces before them the way opened out into a great rounded\\n room that was likewise ablaze with light. Cautiously they crept forward\\n to the threshold of that chamber at the mountain\\'s heart.\\n\\n\\n Its roof was vaulted; its circular walls were lined with panels studded\\n with gleaming control buttons, levers, colored lights. As they watched\\n light flicked on and off in changing patterns, registering the\\n progressive changes in the vast complex of mechanisms for which this\\n must be the central control station. Behind those boards circuits opened\\n and closed in bewildering confusion; the two invaders felt the rapid\\n shifting of magnetic fields, the fury of electrons boiling in vacuum....\\n\\n\\n For long moments they forgot the pursuit, forgot everything in wonder at\\n this place whose remotest like they had never seen in the simplicity of\\n their machineless culture. In all the brilliant space there was no life.\\n They looked at one another, the same thought coming to both at once:\\n perhaps, after two thousand years, the masters were dead after all, and\\n only the machines remained? As if irresistibly drawn, they stepped over\\n the threshold.\\n\\n\\n There was a clang of metal like a signal. Halfway up the wall opposite,\\n above a narrow ramp that descended between the instrument panels, a\\n massive doorway swung wide, and in its opening a figure stood.\\n\\n\\n Var and Neena huddled frozenly, half expecting each instant to be their\\n last. And the Ryzga too stood motionless, looking down at them.\\nHe was a man of middle height and stocky build, clad in a garment of\\n changing colors, of fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In his right hand,\\n with the care one uses with a weapon, he grasped a gleaming metal tube;\\n his other hand rested as for support against the frame of the doorway.\\n That, and his movements when he came slowly down the ramp toward them,\\n conveyed a queer suggestion of weariness or weakness, as if he were yet\\n not wholly roused from his two millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga\\'s\\n manner and his mind radiated a consciousness of power, a pride and\\n assurance of self that smote them like a numbing blow.\\n\\n\\n With a new shock, Var realized that the Ryzga\\'s thoughts were quite\\n open. They had a terse, disconnected quality that was strange and\\n unsettling, and in part they were couched in alien and unintelligible\\n symbols. But there was no block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no need to\\n close his mind in the presence of inferior creatures....\\n\\n\\n He paused with his back to the central control panel, and studied the\\n interlopers with the dispassionate gaze of a scientist examining a new,\\n but not novel, species of insect. His thoughts seemed to click, like\\n metal parts of a mechanism falling into places prepared for them. The\\n image occurred oddly to Var, to whom such a comparison would ordinarily\\n have been totally strange.\\n\\n\\n \"Culture: late barbarism. Handwork of high quality—good. Physically\\n excellent stock....\" There was a complicated and incomprehensible\\n schemata of numbers and abstract forms. \"The time: two thousand\\n years—more progress might have been expected, if any survivors at all\\n initially postulated; but this will do. The pessimists were mistaken. We\\n can begin again.\" Then, startlingly super-imposed on the cool\\n progression of logical thought, came a wave of raw emotion, devastating\\n in its force. It was a lustful image of a world once more obedient,\\n crawling, laboring to do the Ryzgas\\' will—\\ntoward the stars, the\\n stars!\\nThe icy calculation resumed: \"Immobilize these and the ones\\n indicated in the passage above. Then wake the rest....\"\\n\\n\\n Var was staring in fascination at the Ryzga\\'s face. It was a face formed\\n by the custom of unquestioned command; yet it was lined by a deeply\\n ingrained weariness, the signs of premature age—denied, overridden by\\n the driving will they had sensed a moment earlier. It was a sick man\\'s\\n face.\\n\\n\\n The Ryzga\\'s final thought clicked into place:\\nDecision!\\nHe turned\\n toward the switchboard behind him, reaching with practised certainty for\\n one spot upon it.\\n\\n\\n Neena screamed.\\n\\n\\n Between the Ryzga and the control panel a nightmare shape reared up\\n seven feet tall, flapping black amorphous limbs and flashing red eyes\\n and white fangs. The Ryzga recoiled, and the weapon in his hand came up.\\n There was an instantaneous glare like heat lightning, and the monster\\n crumpled in on itself, twitched briefly and vanished.\\n\\n\\n But in that moment a light of inspiration had flashed upon Var, and it\\n remained. As the Ryzga stretched out his hand again, Var acted. The\\n Ryzga froze, teetering off balance and almost falling, as a numbing grip\\n closed down on all his motor nerves.\\n\\n\\n Holding that grip, Var strode across the floor and looked straight into\\n the Ryzga\\'s frantic eyes. They glared back at him with such hatred and\\n such evil that for an instant he almost faltered. But the Ryzga\\'s\\n efforts, as he strove to free himself from the neural hold, were as\\n misdirected and unavailing as those of a child who has not learned to\\n wrestle with the mind.\\n\\n\\n Var had guessed right. When Neena in her terror had flung a dream\\n monster into the Ryzga\\'s way—a mere child\\'s bogey out of a fairy\\n tale—the Ryzga had not recognized it as such, but had taken it for a\\n real being. Var laughed aloud, and with great care, as one communicates\\n with an infant, he projected his thoughts into the other\\'s mind. \"There\\n will be no new beginning for you in\\nour\\nworld, Ryzga! In two thousand\\n years, we\\'ve learned some new things. Now at last I understand why you\\n built so many machines, such complicated arrangements of matter and\\n energy to do simple tasks—it was because you knew no other way.\"\\n\\n\\n Behind the hate-filled eyes the cold brain tried to reason still.\\n \"Barbarians...? Our party was wrong after all. After us the machine\\n civilization could never rise again, because it was a fire that consumed\\n its fuel. After us\\nman\\ncould not survive on the Earth, because the\\n conditions that made him great were gone. The survivors must be\\n something else—capacities undeveloped by our science—after us the end\\n of man, the beginning.... But those of us who chose to die were right.\"\\n\\n\\n The tide of hate and sick desire rose up to drown all coherence. The\\n Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile effort to lift the weapon in his\\n paralyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled upward, and abruptly he went limp\\n and fell in a heap, like a mechanical doll whose motive power has\\n failed.\\n\\n\\n Var felt Neena beside him, and drew her close. As she sobbed her relief,\\n he continued to look down absently at the dead man. When at last he\\n raised his head, he saw that the drama\\'s end had had a further audience.\\n In the outer doorway, backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, gazing first\\n in stupefaction at the fallen Ryzga, then with something like awe at\\n Var.\\n\\n\\n Var eyed him for a long moment; then he smiled, and asked, \"Well, Groz?\\n Is our feud finished, or does your ambition for a worthy son-in-law go\\n beyond the conqueror of the Ryzgas?\"\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

Giles made the expected\\n comments, smiled the proper\\n smiles and greeted his staff by\\n the right names, but it was purely\\n automatic. Somehow, thinking\\n had grown difficult in the mornings\\n recently.\\nInside his private office, he\\n dropped all pretense and slumped\\n into the padding of his chair, gasping\\n for breath and feeling his\\n heart hammering in his chest.\\n He’d been a fool to come to work,\\n he realized. But with the Procyon\\n shuttle arriving yesterday, there\\n was no telling what might turn\\n up. Besides, that fool of a medicist\\n had sworn the shot would\\n cure any allergy or asthma.\\nGiles heard his secretary come\\n in, but it wasn’t until the smell\\n of the coffee reached his nose\\n that he looked up. She handed\\n him a filled cup and set the carafe\\n down on the age-polished surface\\n of the big desk. She watched\\n solicitously as he drank.\\n“That bad, Arthur?” she asked.\\n“Just a little tired,” he told\\n her, refilling the cup. She’d made\\n the coffee stronger than usual\\n and it seemed to cut through\\n some of the thickness in his head.\\n “I guess I’m getting old, Amanda.”\\nShe smiled dutifully at the\\n time-worn joke, but he knew she\\n wasn’t fooled. She’d cycled to\\n middle age four times in her\\n job and she probably knew him\\n better than he knew himself—which\\n wouldn’t be hard, he\\n thought. He’d hardly recognized\\n the stranger in the mirror as he\\n tried to shave. His normal thinness\\n had looked almost gaunt\\n and there were hollows in his\\n face and circles under his eyes.\\n Even his hair had seemed thinner,\\n though that, of course, was\\n impossible.\\n“Anything urgent on the Procyon\\n shuttle?” he asked as she\\n continue staring at him with worried\\n eyes.\\nSHE JERKED her gaze away\\n guiltily and turned to the incoming\\n basket. “Mostly drugs for\\n experimenting. A personal letter\\n for you, relayed from some place\\n I never heard of. And one of the\\n super-light missiles! They found\\n it drifting half a light-year out\\n and captured it. Jordan’s got a\\n report on it and he’s going crazy.\\n But if you don’t feel well—”\\n“I’m all right!” he told her\\n sharply. Then he steadied himself\\n and managed to smile. “Thanks\\n for the coffee, Amanda.”\\nShe accepted dismissal reluctantly.\\n When she was gone, he\\n sat gazing at the report from Jordan\\n at Research.\\nFor eighty years now, they’d\\n been sending out the little ships\\n that vanished at greater than the\\n speed of light, equipped with\\n every conceivable device to make\\n them return automatically after\\n taking pictures of wherever they\\n arrived. So far, none had ever returned\\n or been located. This was\\n the first hope they’d found that\\n the century-long trips between\\n stars in the ponderous shuttles\\n might be ended and he should\\n have been filled with excitement\\n at Jordan’s hasty preliminary report.\\nHe leafed through it. The little\\n ship apparently had been picked\\n up by accident when it almost\\n collided with a Sirius-local ship.\\n Scientists there had puzzled over\\n it, reset it and sent it back. The\\n two white rats on it had still been\\n alive.\\nGiles dropped the report wearily\\n and picked up the personal\\n message that had come on the\\n shuttle. He fingered the microstrip\\n inside while he drank another\\n coffee, and finally pulled\\n out the microviewer. There were\\n three frames to the message, he\\n saw with some surprise.\\nHe didn’t need to see the signature\\n on the first projection.\\n Only his youngest son would have\\n sent an elaborate tercentenary\\n greeting verse—one that would\\n arrive ninety years too late! Harry\\n had been born just before Earth\\n passed the drastic birth limitation\\n act and his mother had\\n spoiled him. He’d even tried to\\n avoid the compulsory emigration\\n draft and stay on with his mother.\\n It had been the bitter quarrels\\n over that which had finally\\n broken Giles’ fifth marriage.\\nOddly enough, the message in\\n the next frame showed none of\\n that. Harry had nothing but\\n praise for the solar system where\\n he’d been sent. He barely mentioned\\n being married on the way\\n or his dozen children, but filled\\n most of the frame with glowing\\n description and a plea for his\\n father to join him there!\\nGILES SNORTED and turned\\n to the third frame, which\\n showed a group picture of the\\n family in some sort of vehicle,\\n against the background of an alien\\n but attractive world.\\nHe had no desire to spend\\n ninety years cooped up with a\\n bunch of callow young emigrants,\\n even in one of the improved Exodus\\n shuttles. And even if Exodus\\n ever got the super-light\\n drive working, there was no reason\\n he should give up his work.\\n The discovery that men could\\n live practically forever had put\\n an end to most family ties; sentiment\\n wore thin in half a century—which\\n wasn’t much time\\n now, though it had once seemed\\n long enough.\\nStrange how the years seemed\\n to get shorter as their number increased.\\n There’d been a song\\n once—something about the years\\n dwindling down. He groped for\\n the lines and couldn’t remember.\\n Drat it! Now he’d probably lie\\n awake most of the night again,\\n trying to recall them.\\nThe outside line buzzed musically,\\n flashing Research’s number.\\n Giles grunted in irritation. He\\n wasn’t ready to face Jordan yet.\\n But he shrugged and pressed the\\n button.\\nThe intense face that looked\\n from the screen was frowning as\\n Jordan’s eyes seemed to sweep\\n around the room. He was still\\n young—one of the few under\\n a hundred who’d escaped deportation\\n because of special ability—and\\n patience was still foreign to\\n him.\\nThen the frown vanished as\\n an expression of shock replaced\\n it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.\\n If he looked\\nthat\\nbad—\\nBut Jordan wasn’t looking at\\n him; the man’s interest lay in the\\n projected picture from Harry, across\\n the desk from the communicator.\\n“Antigravity!” His voice was\\n unbelieving as he turned his head\\n to face the older man. “What\\n world is that?”\\nGiles forced his attention on\\n the picture again and this time\\n he noticed the vehicle shown. It\\n was enough like an old model\\n Earth conveyance to pass casual\\n inspection, but it floated wheellessly\\n above the ground. Faint\\n blur lines indicated it had been\\n moving when the picture was\\n taken.\\n“One of my sons—” Giles\\n started to answer. “I could find\\n the star’s designation....”\\nJordan cursed harshly. “So we\\n can send a message on the shuttle,\\n begging for their secret in a\\n couple of hundred years! While\\n a hundred other worlds make a\\n thousand major discoveries they\\n don’t bother reporting! Can’t the\\n Council see\\nanything\\n?”\\nGiles had heard it all before.\\n Earth was becoming a backwater\\n world; no real progress had been\\n made in two centuries; the young\\n men were sent out as soon as\\n their first fifty years of education\\n were finished, and the older men\\n were too conservative for really\\n new thinking. There was a measure\\n of truth in it, unfortunately.\\n“They’ll slow up when their\\n populations fill,” Giles repeated\\n his old answers. “We’re still ahead\\n in medicine and we’ll get the\\n other discoveries eventually, without\\n interrupting the work of making\\n the Earth fit for our longevity.\\n We can wait. We’ll have to.”\\nTHE YOUNGER man stared\\n at him with the strange puzzled\\n look Giles had seen too often\\n lately. “Damn it, haven’t you read\\n my report? We know the super-light\\n drive works! That missile\\n reached Sirius in less than ten\\n days. We can have the secret of\\n this antigravity in less than a\\n year! We—”\\n“Wait a minute.” Giles felt the\\n thickness pushing back at his\\n mind and tried to fight it off. He’d\\n only skimmed the report, but this\\n made no sense. “You mean you\\n can calibrate your guiding devices\\n accurately enough to get a\\n missile where you want it and\\n back?”\\n“\\nWhat?\\n” Jordan’s voice rattled\\n the speaker. “Of course not! It\\n took two accidents to get the\\n thing back to us—and with a\\n half-light-year miss that delayed\\n it about twenty years before the\\n Procyon shuttle heard its signal.\\n Pre-setting a course may take\\n centuries, if we can ever master\\n it. Even with Sirius expecting the\\n missiles and ready to cooperate.\\n I mean the big ship. We’ve had it\\n drafted for building long enough;\\n now we can finish it in three\\n months. We know the drive works.\\n We know it’s fast enough to reach\\n Procyon in two weeks. We even\\n know life can stand the trip. The\\n rats were unharmed.”\\nGiles shook his head at what\\n the other was proposing, only\\n partly believing it. “Rats don’t\\n have minds that could show any\\n real damage such as the loss of\\n power to rejuvenate. We can’t put\\n human pilots into a ship with our\\n drive until we’ve tested it more\\n thoroughly, Bill, even if they\\n could correct for errors on arrival.\\n Maybe if we put in stronger signaling\\n transmitters....”\\n“Yeah. Maybe in two centuries\\n we’d have a through route charted\\n to Sirius. And we still wouldn’t\\n have proved it safe for human\\n pilots. Mr. Giles, we’ve got to\\n have the big ship. All we need is\\none\\nvolunteer!”\\nIt occurred to Giles then that\\n the man had been too fired with\\n the idea to think. He leaned back,\\n shaking his head again wearily.\\n “All right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.\\n Or how about you? Do\\n you really want to risk losing the\\n rest of your life rather than waiting\\n a couple more centuries until\\n we know it’s safe? If you do, I’ll\\n order the big ship.”\\nJordan opened his mouth and\\n for a second Giles’ heart caught\\n in a flux of emotions as the\\n man’s offer hovered on his lips.\\n Then the engineer shut his mouth\\n slowly. The belligerence ran out\\n of him.\\nHe looked sick, for he had no\\n answer.\\nNO SANE man would risk a\\n chance for near eternity\\n against such a relatively short\\n wait. Heroism had belonged to\\n those who knew their days were\\n numbered, anyhow.\\n“Forget it, Bill,” Giles advised.\\n “It may take longer, but eventually\\n we’ll find a way. With time\\n enough, we’re bound to. And\\n when we do, the ship will be\\n ready.”\\nThe engineer nodded miserably\\n and clicked off. Giles turned\\n from the blank screen to stare\\n out of the windows, while his\\n hand came up to twist at the lock\\n of hair over his forehead. Eternity!\\n They had to plan and build\\n for it. They couldn’t risk that\\n plan for short-term benefits. Usually\\n it was too easy to realize that,\\n and the sight of the solid, time-enduring\\n buildings outside should\\n have given him a sense of security.\\nToday, though, nothing seemed\\n to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\\n somehow lost; the city beyond\\n the window blurred as he\\n studied it, and he swung the chair\\n back so violently that his hand\\n jerked painfully on the forelock\\n he’d been twisting.\\nThen he was staring unbelievingly\\n at the single white hair that\\n was twisted with the dark ones\\n between his fingers.\\nLike an automaton, he bent\\n forward, his other hand groping\\n for the mirror that should be in\\n one of the drawers. The dull pain\\n in his chest sharpened and his\\n breath was hoarse in his throat,\\n but he hardly noticed as he found\\n the mirror and brought it up. His\\n eyes focused reluctantly. There\\n were other white strands in his\\n dark hair.\\nThe mirror crashed to the floor\\n as he staggered out of the office.\\nIt was only two blocks to Giles’\\n residence club, but he had to\\n stop twice to catch his breath\\n and fight against the pain that\\n clawed at his chest. When he\\n reached the wood-paneled lobby,\\n he was barely able to stand.\\nDubbins was at his side almost\\n at once, with a hand under\\n his arm to guide him toward his\\n suite.\\n“Let me help you, sir,” Dubbins\\n suggested, in the tones\\n Giles hadn’t heard since the man\\n had been his valet, back when\\n it was still possible to find personal\\n servants. Now he managed\\n the club on a level of quasi-equality\\n with the members. For the\\n moment, though, he’d slipped\\n back into the old ways.\\nGILES FOUND himself lying\\n on his couch, partially undressed,\\n with the pillows just right\\n and a long drink in his hand. The\\n alcohol combined with the reaction\\n from his panic to leave him\\n almost himself again. After all,\\n there was nothing to worry about;\\n Earth’s doctors could cure anything.\\n“I guess you’d better call Dr.\\n Vincenti,” he decided. Vincenti\\n was a member and would probably\\n be the quickest to get.\\nDubbins shook his head. “Dr.\\n Vincenti isn’t with us, sir. He\\n left a year ago to visit a son in\\n the Centauri system. There’s a\\n Dr. Cobb whose reputation is\\n very good, sir.”\\nGiles puzzled over it doubtfully.\\n Vincenti had been an oddly\\n morose man the last few times\\n he’d seen him, but that could\\n hardly explain his taking a twenty-year\\n shuttle trip for such a\\n slim reason. It was no concern of\\n his, though. “Dr. Cobb, then,” he\\n said.\\nGiles heard the other man’s\\n voice on the study phone, too low\\n for the words to be distinguishable.\\n He finished the drink, feeling\\n still better, and was sitting\\n up when Dubbins came back.\\n“Dr. Cobb wants you to come\\n to his office at once, sir,” he said,\\n dropping to his knee to help\\n Giles with his shoes. “I’d be\\n pleased to drive you there.”\\nGiles frowned. He’d expected\\n Cobb to come to him. Then he\\n grimaced at his own thoughts.\\n Dubbins’ manners must have carried\\n him back into the past; doctors\\n didn’t go in for home visits\\n now—they preferred to see their\\n patients in the laboratories that\\n housed their offices. If this kept\\n on, he’d be missing the old days\\n when he’d had a mansion and\\n counted his wealth in possessions,\\n instead of the treasures he could\\n build inside himself for the future\\n ahead. He was getting positively\\n childish!\\nYet he relished the feeling of\\n having Dubbins drive his car.\\n More than anything else, he’d\\n loved being driven. Even after\\n chauffeurs were a thing of the\\n past, Harry had driven him\\n around. Now he’d taken to walking,\\n as so many others had, for\\n even with modern safety measures\\n so strict, there was always\\n a small chance of some accident\\n and nobody had any desire to\\n spend the long future as a cripple.\\n“I’ll wait for you, sir,” Dubbins\\n offered as they stopped beside\\n the low, massive medical building.\\nIt was almost too much consideration.\\n Giles nodded, got out\\n and headed down the hall uncertainly.\\n Just how bad did he\\n look? Well, he’d soon find out.\\nHe located the directory and\\n finally found the right office, its\\n reception room wall covered\\n with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had\\n picked up in some three hundred\\n years of practice. Giles felt\\n better, realizing it wouldn’t be\\n one of the younger men.\\nCOBB APPEARED himself,\\n before the nurse could take\\n over, and led Giles into a room\\n with an old-fashioned desk and\\n chairs that almost concealed the\\n cabinets of equipment beyond.\\nHe listened as Giles stumbled\\n out his story. Halfway through,\\n the nurse took a blood sample\\n with one of the little mosquito\\n needles and the machinery behind\\n the doctor began working on\\n it.\\n“Your friend told me about the\\n gray hair, of course,” Cobb said.\\n At Giles’ look, he smiled faintly.\\n “Surely you didn’t think people\\n could miss that in this day and\\n age? Let’s see it.”\\nHe inspected it and began\\n making tests. Some were older\\n than Giles could remember—knee\\n reflex, blood pressure, pulse\\n and fluoroscope. Others involved\\n complicated little gadgets that\\n ran over his body, while meters\\n bobbed and wiggled. The blood\\n check came through and Cobb\\n studied it, to go back and make\\n further inspections of his own.\\nAt last he nodded slowly.\\n “Hyper-catabolism, of course. I\\n thought it might be. How long\\n since you had your last rejuvenation?\\n And who gave it?”\\n“About ten years ago,” Giles\\n answered. He found his identity\\n card and passed it over, while\\n the doctor studied it. “My sixteenth.”\\nIt wasn’t going right. He could\\n feel it. Some of the panic symptoms\\n were returning; the pulse in\\n his neck was pounding and his\\n breath was growing difficult.\\n Sweat ran down his sides from\\n his armpit and he wiped his palms\\n against his coat.\\n“Any particular emotional\\n strain when you were treated—some\\n major upset in your life?”\\n Cobb asked.\\nGiles thought as carefully as\\n he could, but he remembered\\n nothing like that. “You mean—it\\n didn’t take? But I never had\\n any trouble, Doctor. I was one of\\n the first million cases, when a\\n lot of people couldn’t rejuvenate\\n at all, and I had no trouble even\\n then.”\\nCobb considered it, hesitated as\\n if making up his mind to be frank\\n against his better judgment. “I\\n can’t see any other explanation.\\n You’ve got a slight case of angina—nothing\\n serious, but quite definite—as\\n well as other signs\\n of aging. I’m afraid the treatment\\n didn’t take fully. It might have\\n been some unconscious block\\n on your part, some infection not\\n diagnosed at the time, or even a\\n fault in the treatment. That’s\\n pretty rare, but we can’t neglect\\n the possibility.”\\nHE STUDIED his charts again\\n and then smiled. “So we’ll\\n give you another treatment. Any\\n reason you can’t begin immediately?”\\nGiles remembered that Dubbins\\n was waiting for him, but this\\n was more important. It hadn’t\\n been a joke about his growing old,\\n after all. But now, in a few days,\\n he’d be his old—no, of course\\n not—his young self again!\\nThey went down the hall to\\n another office, where Giles waited\\n outside while Cobb conferred\\n with another doctor and technician,\\n with much waving of charts.\\n He resented every second of it.\\n It was as if the almost forgotten\\n specter of age stood beside him,\\n counting the seconds. But at last\\n they were through and he was led\\n into the quiet rejuvenation room,\\n where the clamps were adjusted\\n about his head and the earpieces\\n were fitted. The drugs were shot\\n painlessly into his arm and the\\n light-pulser was adjusted to his\\n brain-wave pattern.\\nIt had been nothing like this his\\n first time. Then it had required\\n months of mental training, followed\\n by crude mechanical and\\n drug hypnosis for other months.\\n Somewhere in every human brain\\n lay the memory of what his cells\\n had been like when he was young.\\n Or perhaps it lay in the cells\\n themselves, with the brain as only\\n a linkage to it. They’d discovered\\n that, and the fact that the mind\\n could effect physical changes in\\n the body. Even such things as\\n cancer could be willed out of existence—provided\\n the brain\\n could be reached far below the\\n conscious level and forced to\\n operate.\\nThere had been impossible\\n faith cures for millenia—cataracts\\n removed from blinded eyes\\n within minutes, even—but finding\\n the mechanism in the brain\\n that worked those miracles had\\n taken an incredible amount of\\n study and finding a means of\\n bringing it under control had\\n taken even longer.\\nNow they did it with dozens of\\n mechanical aids in addition to\\n the hypnotic instructions—and\\n did it usually in a single sitting,\\n with the full transformation of\\n the body taking less than a week\\n after the treatment!\\nBut with all the equipment, it\\n wasn’t impossible for a mistake\\n to happen. It had been no fault of\\n his ... he was sure of that ... his\\n mind was easy to reach ... he\\n could relax so easily....\\nHe came out of it without\\n even a headache, while they were\\n removing the probes, but the\\n fatigue on the operator’s face told\\n him it had been a long and difficult\\n job. He stretched experimentally,\\n with the eternal unconscious\\n expectation that he would\\n find himself suddenly young\\n again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.\\n It took days for the mind\\n to work on all the cells and to\\n repair the damage of time.\\nCOBB LED him back to the\\n first office, where he was given\\n an injection of some kind and\\n another sample of his blood was\\n taken, while the earlier tests were\\n repeated. But finally the doctor\\n nodded.\\n“That’s all for now, Mr. Giles.\\n You might drop in tomorrow\\n morning, after I’ve had a chance\\n to complete my study of all this.\\n We’ll know by then whether you’ll\\n need more treatment. Ten o’clock\\n okay?”\\n“But I’ll be all right?”\\nCobb smiled the automatic reassurance\\n of his profession. “We\\n haven’t lost a patient in two hundred\\n years, to my knowledge.”\\n“Thanks,” said Giles. “Ten\\n o’clock is fine.”\\nDubbins was still waiting, reading\\n a paper whose headlined feature\\n carried a glowing account of\\n the discovery of the super-light\\n missile and what it might mean.\\n He took a quick look at Giles and\\n pointed to it. “Great work, Mr.\\n Giles. Maybe we’ll all get to see\\n some of those other worlds yet.”\\n Then he studied Giles more carefully.\\n “Everything’s in good shape\\n now, sir?”\\n“The doctor says everything’s\\n going to be fine,” Giles answered.\\nIt was then he realized for the\\n first time that Cobb had said no\\n such thing. A statement that\\n lightning had never struck a\\n house was no guarantee that it\\n never would. It was an evasion\\n meant to give such an impression.\\nThe worry nagged at him all\\n the way back. Word had already\\n gone around the club that he’d\\n had some kind of attack and\\n there were endless questions that\\n kept it on his mind. And even\\n when it had been covered and\\n recovered, he could still sense the\\n glances of the others, as if he\\n were Vincenti in one of the man’s\\n more morose moods.\\nHe found a single table in the\\n dining room and picked his way\\n through the meal, listening to\\n the conversation about him only\\n when it was necessary because\\n someone called across to him.\\n Ordinarily, he was quick to support\\n the idea of clubs in place\\n of private families. A man here\\n could choose his group and grow\\n into them. Yet he wasn’t swallowed\\n by them, as he might be by\\n a family. Giles had been living\\n here for nearly a century now and\\n he’d never regretted it. But tonight\\n his own group irritated him.\\nHe puzzled over it, finding no\\n real reason. Certainly they weren’t\\n forcing themselves on him. He\\n remembered once when he’d had\\n a cold, before they finally licked\\n that; Harry had been a complete\\n nuisance, running around with\\n various nostrums, giving him no\\n peace. Constant questions about\\n how he felt, constant little looks\\n of worry—until he’d been ready\\n to yell at the boy. In fact, he\\n had.\\nFunny, he couldn’t picture really\\n losing his temper here. Families\\n did odd things to a man.\\nHE LISTENED to a few of\\n the discussions after the dinner,\\n but he’d heard them all before,\\n except for one about the\\n super-speed drive, and there he\\n had no wish to talk until he could\\n study the final report. He gave up\\n at last and went to his own suite.\\n What he needed was a good\\n night’s sleep after a little relaxation.\\nEven that failed him, though.\\n He’d developed one of the finest\\n chess collections in the world, but\\n tonight it held no interest. And\\n when he drew out his tools and\\n tried working on the delicate,\\n lovely jade for the set he was\\n carving his hands seemed to be\\n all thumbs. None of the other interests\\n he’d developed through\\n the years helped to add to the\\n richness of living now.\\nHe gave it up and went to bed—to\\n have the fragment of that\\n song pop into his head. Now there\\n was no escaping it. Something\\n about the years—or was it days—dwindling\\n down to something\\n or other.\\nCould they really dwindle\\n down? Suppose he couldn’t rejuvenate\\n all the way? He knew\\n that there were some people who\\n didn’t respond as well as others.\\n Sol Graves, for instance. He’d\\n been fifty when he finally learned\\n how to work with the doctors and\\n they could only bring him back to\\n about thirty, instead of the normal\\n early twenties. Would that\\n reduce the slice of eternity that\\n rejuvenation meant? And what\\n had happened to Sol?\\nOr suppose it wasn’t rejuvenation,\\n after all; suppose something\\n had gone wrong with him\\n permanently?\\nHe fought that off, but he\\n couldn’t escape the nagging\\n doubts at the doctor’s words.\\nHe got up once to stare at himself\\n in the mirror. Ten hours had\\n gone by and there should have\\n been some signs of improvement.\\n He couldn’t be sure, though,\\n whether there were or not.\\nHe looked no better the next\\n morning when he finally dragged\\n himself up from the little sleep\\n he’d managed to get. The hollows\\n were still there and the circles\\n under his eyes. He searched for\\n the gray in his hair, but the traitorous\\n strands had been removed\\n at the doctor’s office and he could\\n find no new ones.\\nHe looked into the dining room\\n and then went by hastily. He\\n wanted no solicitous glances this\\n morning. Drat it, maybe he\\n should move out. Maybe trying\\n family life again would give him\\n some new interests. Amanda probably\\n would be willing to marry\\n him; she’d hinted at a date once.\\nHe stopped, shocked by the\\n awareness that he hadn’t been out\\n with a woman for....\\nHe couldn’t remember how\\n long it had been. Nor why.\\n“In the spring, a young man’s\\n fancy,” he quoted to himself, and\\n then shuddered.\\nIt hadn’t been that kind of\\n spring for him—not this rejuvenation\\n nor the last, nor the one\\n before that.\\nGILES TRIED to stop scaring\\n himself and partially succeeded,\\n until he reached the doctor’s\\n office. Then it was no longer necessary\\n to frighten himself. The\\n wrongness was too strong, no matter\\n how professional Cobb’s smile!\\nHe didn’t hear the preliminary\\n words. He watched the smile vanish\\n as the stack of reports came\\n out. There was no nurse here\\n now. The machines were quiet—and\\n all the doors were shut.\\nGiles shook his head, interrupting\\n the doctor’s technical jargon.\\n Now that he knew there was reason\\n for his fear, it seemed to\\n vanish, leaving a coldness that\\n numbed him.\\n“I’d rather know the whole\\n truth,” he said. His voice sounded\\n dead in his ears. “The worst first.\\n The rejuvenation...?”\\nCobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.\\n “Failed.” He stopped, and\\n his hands touched the reports on\\n his desk. “Completely,” he added\\n in a low, defeated tone.\\n“But I thought that was impossible!”\\n“So did I. I wouldn’t believe\\n it even yet—but now I find it\\n isn’t the first case. I spent the\\n night at Medical Center going up\\n the ranks until I found men who\\n really know about it. And now I\\n wish I hadn’t.” His voice ran\\n down and he gathered himself together\\n by an effort. “It’s a shock\\n to me, too, Mr. Giles. But—well,\\n to simplify it, no memory is perfect—even\\n cellular memory. It\\n loses a little each time. And the\\n effect is cumulative. It’s like an\\n asymptotic curve—the further it\\n goes, the steeper the curve. And—well,\\n you’ve passed too far.”\\nHe faced away from Giles,\\n dropping the reports into a\\n drawer and locking it. “I wasn’t\\n supposed to tell you, of course.\\n It’s going to be tough enough\\n when they’re ready to let people\\n know. But you aren’t the first and\\n you won’t be the last, if that’s any\\n consolation. We’ve got a longer\\n time scale than we used to have—but\\n it’s in centuries, not in\\n eons. For everybody, not just\\n you.”\\nIt was no consolation. Giles\\n nodded mechanically. “I won’t\\n talk, of course. How—how long?”\\nCobb spread his hands unhappily.\\n “Thirty years, maybe. But\\n we can make them better. Geriatric\\n knowledge is still on record.\\n We can fix the heart and all the\\n rest. You’ll be in good physical\\n condition, better than your grandfather—”\\n“And then....” Giles couldn’t\\n pronounce the words. He’d grown\\n old and he’d grow older. And\\n eventually he’d die!\\nAn immortal man had suddenly\\n found death hovering on his\\n trail. The years had dwindled and\\n gone, and only a few were left.\\nHe stood up, holding out his\\n hand. “Thank you, Doctor,” he\\n said, and was surprised to find\\n he meant it. The man had done\\n all he could and had at least\\n saved him the suspense of growing\\n doubt and horrible eventual\\n discovery.\\nOUTSIDE ON the street, he\\n looked up at the Sun and\\n then at the buildings built to last\\n for thousands of years. Their\\n eternity was no longer a part of\\n him.\\nEven his car would outlast him.\\nHe climbed into it, still partly\\n numbed, and began driving mechanically,\\n no longer wondering\\n about the dangers that might possibly\\n arise. Those wouldn’t matter\\n much now. For a man who\\n had thought of living almost forever,\\n thirty years was too short\\n a time to count.\\nHe was passing near the club\\n and started to slow. Then he\\n went on without stopping. He\\n wanted no chance to have them\\n asking questions he couldn’t answer.\\n It was none of their business.\\n Dubbins had been kind—but\\n now Giles wanted no kindness.\\nThe street led to the office\\n and he drove on. What else was\\n there for him? There, at least, he\\n could still fill his time with work—work\\n that might even be useful.\\n In the future, men would\\n need the super-light drive if they\\n were to span much more of the\\n Universe than now. And he could\\n speed up the work in some ways\\n still, even if he could never see\\n its finish.\\nIt would be cold comfort but it\\n was something. And he might\\n keep busy enough to forget sometimes\\n that the years were gone\\n for him.\\nAutomatic habit carried him\\n through the office again, to Amanda’s\\n desk, where her worry was\\n still riding her. He managed a\\n grin and somehow the right words\\n came to his lips. “I saw the doctor,\\n Amanda, so you can stop\\n figuring ways to get me there.”\\nShe smiled back suddenly, without\\n feigning it. “Then you’re all\\n right?”\\n“As all right as I’ll ever be,”\\n he told her. “They tell me I’m just\\n growing old.”\\nThis time her laugh was heartier.\\n He caught himself before he\\n could echo her mirth in a different\\n voice and went inside where she\\n had the coffee waiting for him.\\nOddly, it still tasted good to\\n him.\\nThe projection was off, he saw,\\n wondering whether he’d left it on\\n or not. He snapped the switch and\\n saw the screen light up, with the\\n people still in the odd, wheelless\\n vehicle on the alien planet.\\nFOR A long moment, he stared\\n at the picture without thinking,\\n and then bent closer. Harry’s\\n face hadn’t changed much. Giles\\n had almost forgotten it, but there\\n was still the same grin there. And\\n his grandchildren had a touch\\n of it, too. And of their grandfather’s\\n nose, he thought. Funny,\\n he’d never seen even pictures of\\n his other grandchildren. Family\\n ties melted away too fast for interstellar\\n travel.\\nYet there seemed to be no\\n slackening of them in Harry’s\\n case, and somehow it looked like\\n a family, rather than a mere\\n group. A very pleasant family in\\n a very pleasant world.\\nHe read Harry’s note again,\\n with its praise for the planet and\\n its invitation. He wondered if\\n Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation\\n like that, before he left.\\n Or had he even been one of those\\n to whom the same report had\\n been delivered by some doctor?\\n It didn’t matter, but it would explain\\n things, at least.\\nTwenty years to Centaurus,\\n while the years dwindled down—\\nThen abruptly the line finished\\n itself. “The years dwindle down\\n to a precious few....” he remembered.\\n “A precious few.”\\nThose dwindling years had\\n been precious once. He unexpectedly\\n recalled his own grandfather\\n holding him on an old\\n knee and slipping him candy\\n that was forbidden. The years\\n seemed precious to the old man\\n then.\\nAmanda’s voice came abruptly\\n over the intercom. “Jordan wants\\n to talk to you,” she said, and the\\n irritation was sharp in her voice.\\n “He won’t take no!”\\nGiles shrugged and reached for\\n the projector, to cut it off. Then,\\n on impulse, he set it back to the\\n picture, studying the group again\\n as he switched on Jordan’s wire.\\nBut he didn’t wait for the hot\\n words about whatever was the\\n trouble.\\n“Bill,” he said, “start getting\\n the big ship into production. I’ve\\n found a volunteer.”\\nHe’d been driven to it, he knew,\\n as he watched the man’s amazed\\n face snap from the screen. From\\n the first suspicion of his trouble,\\n something inside him had been\\n forcing him to make this decision.\\n And maybe it would do no good.\\n Maybe the ship would fail. But\\n thirty years was a number a man\\n could risk.\\nIf he made it, though....\\nWell, he’d see those grandchildren\\n of his this year—and\\n Harry. Maybe he’d even tell\\n Harry the truth, once they got\\n done celebrating the reunion. And\\n there’d be other grandchildren.\\n With the ship, he’d have time\\n enough to look them up. Plenty\\n of time!\\nThirty years was a long time,\\n when he stopped to think of it.\\n—LESTER DEL REY\\n'\u001B[0m,\n",

       "    \u001B[33mresponse\u001B[0m=\u001B[32m'In a tale that intertwines the past and the present, the narrative explores the eerie connection between Ned Vince, who faces a near-death experience, and the ancient Kar-Rah, a species with an incredible science embedded in their minds. As Ned grapples with his fate in the depths of the Pit, the story hints at the physical attributes shared between him and the Kar-Rah, particularly emphasizing their remarkable ability to maintain an upright stance, which allows for a unique perspective of their surroundings. This parallel serves to highlight the evolutionary traits that have persisted through time, suggesting a striking resemblance in posture that resonates with the human experience of the 20th century. The vivid imagery of the sun-drenched landscape and the haunting cries from the depths further enrich the narrative, drawing a subtle yet compelling comparison between these two beings.'\u001B[0m,\n",

GALLUN\\nA scream of brakes, the splash\\n into icy waters, a long descent\\n into alkaline depths ... it was\\n death. But Ned Vince lived\\n again—a million years later!\\n\"See\\n you in half an hour,\\n Betty,\" said Ned Vince\\n over the party telephone. \"We\\'ll\\n be out at the Silver Basket before\\n ten-thirty....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was eager for the\\n company of the girl he loved.\\n That was why he was in a hurry\\n to get to the neighboring town\\n of Hurley, where she lived. His\\n old car rattled and roared as he\\n swung it recklessly around Pit\\n Bend.\\n\\n\\n There was where Death tapped\\n him on the shoulder. Another car\\n leaped suddenly into view, its\\n lights glaring blindingly past a\\n high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic\\n rock at the turn of the road.\\n\\n\\n Dazzled, and befuddled by his\\n own rash speed, Ned Vince had\\n only swift young reflexes to rely\\n on to avoid a fearful, telescoping\\n collision. He flicked his wheel\\n smoothly to the right; but the\\n County Highway Commission\\n hadn\\'t yet tarred the traffic-loosened\\n gravel at the Bend.\\nAn incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures.\\nNed could scarcely have chosen\\n a worse place to start sliding and\\n spinning. His car hit the white-painted\\n wooden rail sideways,\\n crashed through, tumbled down\\n a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,\\n bounced up a little, and\\n arced outward, falling as gracefully\\n as a swan-diver toward the\\n inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet\\n beneath....\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince was still dimly conscious\\n when that black, quiet\\n pool geysered around him in a\\n mighty splash. He had only a\\n dazing welt on his forehead, and\\n a gag of terror in his throat.\\n\\n\\n Movement was slower now, as\\n he began to sink, trapped inside\\n his wrecked car. Nothing that he\\n could imagine could mean doom\\n more certainly than this. The Pit\\n was a tremendously deep pocket\\n in the ground, spring-fed. The\\n edges of that almost bottomless\\n pool were caked with a rim of\\n white—for the water, on which\\n dead birds so often floated, was\\n surcharged with alkali. As that\\n heavy, natronous liquid rushed\\n up through the openings and\\n cracks beneath his feet, Ned\\n Vince knew that his friends and\\n his family would never see his\\n body again, lost beyond recovery\\n in this abyss.\\n\\n\\n The car was deeply submerged.\\n The light had blinked out on the\\n dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute\\n darkness. A flood rushed\\n in at the shattered window. He\\n clawed at the door, trying to\\n open it, but it was jammed in\\n the crash-bent frame, and he\\n couldn\\'t fight against the force\\n of that incoming water. The\\n welt, left by the blow he had received\\n on his forehead, put a\\n thickening mist over his brain,\\n so that he could not think clearly.\\n Presently, when he could no\\n longer hold his breath, bitter\\n liquid was sucked into his lungs.\\n\\n\\n His last thoughts were those\\n of a drowning man. The machine-shop\\n he and his dad had\\n had in Harwich. Betty Moore,\\n with the smiling Irish eyes—like\\n in the song. Betty and he\\n had planned to go to the State\\n University this Fall. They\\'d\\n planned to be married sometime....\\n Goodbye, Betty ...\\n\\n\\n The ripples that had ruffled\\n the surface waters in the Pit,\\n quieted again to glassy smoothness.\\n The eternal stars shone\\n calmly. The geologic Dakota\\n hills, which might have seen the\\n dinosaurs, still bulked along the\\n highway. Time, the Brother of\\n Death, and the Father of\\n Change, seemed to wait....\\n\"Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!... Kaalleee!...\"\\n\\n\\n The excited cry, which no human\\n throat could quite have duplicated\\n accurately, arose thinly\\n from the depths of a powder-dry\\n gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable\\n antiquity. The noon-day\\n Sun was red and huge. The\\n air was tenuous, dehydrated,\\n chill.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,\\n tik!...\"'\u001B[0m\u001B[39m,\u001B[0m\n",

Then other\\n vocal organs took up that trilling\\n wail, and those short, sharp\\n chuckles of eagerness. Other\\n questioning, wondering notes\\n mixed with the cadence. Lacking\\n qualities identifiable as human,\\n the disturbance was still like the\\n babble of a group of workmen\\n who have discovered something\\n remarkable.\\n\\n\\n The desolate expanse around\\n the gulch, was all but without\\n motion. The icy breeze tore tiny\\n puffs of dust from grotesque,\\n angling drifts of soil, nearly\\n waterless for eons. Patches of\\n drab lichen grew here and there\\n on the up-jutting rocks, but in\\n the desert itself, no other life\\n was visible. Even the hills had\\n sagged away, flattened by incalculable\\n ages of erosion.\\nAt a mile distance, a crumbling\\n heap of rubble arose. Once\\n it had been a building. A gigantic,\\n jagged mass of detritus\\n slanted upward from its crest—red\\n debris that had once been\\n steel. A launching catapult for\\n the last space ships built by the\\n gods in exodus, perhaps it was—half\\n a million years ago. Man\\n was gone from the Earth. Glacial\\n ages, war, decadence, disease,\\n and a final scattering of those\\n ultimate superhumans to newer\\n worlds in other solar systems,\\n had done that.\\n\\n\\n \"Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n The sounds were not human.\\n They were more like the chatter\\n and wail of small desert animals.\\n\\n\\n But there was a seeming paradox\\n here in the depths of that\\n gulch, too. The glint of metal,\\n sharp and burnished. The flat,\\n streamlined bulk of a flying machine,\\n shiny and new. The bell-like\\n muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,\\n which seemed to\\n depend on a blast of atoms to\\n clear away rock and soil. Thus\\n the gulch had been cleared of the\\n accumulated rubbish of antiquity.\\n Man, it seemed, had a successor,\\n as ruler of the Earth.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk had flown his geological\\n expedition out from the\\n far lowlands to the east, out\\n from the city of Kar-Rah. And\\n he was very happy now—flushed\\n with a vast and unlooked-for\\n success.\\n\\n\\n He crouched there on his\\n haunches, at the dry bottom of\\n the Pit. The breeze rumpled his\\n long, brown fur. He wasn\\'t very\\n different in appearance from his\\n ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,\\n as he squatted there in that antique\\n stance of his kind. His tail\\n was short and furred, his undersides\\n creamy. White whiskers\\n spread around his inquisitive,\\n pink-tipped snout.\\n\\n\\n But his cranium bulged up and\\n forward between shrewd, beady\\n eyes, betraying the slow heritage\\n of time, of survival of the fittest,\\n of evolution. He could think and\\n dream and invent, and the civilization\\n of his kind was already\\n far beyond that of the ancient\\n Twentieth Century.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk and his fellow workers\\n were gathered, tense and\\n gleeful, around the things their\\n digging had exposed to the daylight.\\n There was a gob of junk—scarcely\\n more than an irregular\\n formation of flaky rust. But imbedded\\n in it was a huddled form,\\n brown and hard as old wood. The\\n dry mud that had encased it\\n like an airtight coffin, had by\\n now been chipped away by the\\n tiny investigators; but soiled\\n clothing still clung to it, after\\n perhaps a million years. Metal\\n had gone into decay—yes. But\\n not this body. The answer to this\\n was simple—alkali. A mineral\\n saturation that had held time\\n and change in stasis. A perfect\\n preservative for organic tissue,\\n aided probably during most of\\n those passing eras by desert dryness.\\n The Dakotas had turned\\n arid very swiftly. This body was\\n not a mere fossil. It was a\\n mummy.\\n\"Kaalleee!\" Man, that meant.\\n Not the star-conquering demi-gods,\\n but the ancestral stock\\n that had built the first\\n machines on Earth, and in the\\n early Twenty-first Century, the\\n first interplanetary rockets. No\\n wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers\\n were happy in their\\n paleontological enthusiasm! A\\n strange accident, happening in a\\n legendary antiquity, had aided\\n them in their quest for knowledge.'\u001B[0m\u001B[39m,\u001B[0m\n",

The chant of\\n triumph ended, while instruments\\n flicked in his tiny hands.\\n The final instrument he used to\\n test the mummy, looked like a\\n miniature stereoscope, with complicated\\n details. He held it over\\n his eyes. On the tiny screen\\n within, through the agency of\\n focused X-rays, he saw magnified\\n images of the internal organs\\n of this ancient human\\n corpse.\\n\\n\\n What his probing gaze revealed\\n to him, made his pleasure\\n even greater than before. In\\n twittering, chattering sounds, he\\n communicated his further knowledge\\n to his henchmen. Though\\n devoid of moisture, the mummy\\n was perfectly preserved, even to\\n its brain cells! Medical and biological\\n sciences were far advanced\\n among Loy Chuk\\'s kind.\\n Perhaps, by the application of\\n principles long known to them,\\n this long-dead body could be\\n made to live again! It might\\n move, speak, remember its past!\\n What a marvelous subject for\\n study it would make, back there\\n in the museums of Kar-Rah!\\n\\n\\n \"Tik, tik, tik!...\"\\n\\n\\n But Loy silenced this fresh,\\n eager chattering with a command.\\n Work was always more\\n substantial than cheering.\\nWith infinite care—small,\\n sharp hand-tools were used, now—the\\n mummy of Ned Vince was\\n disengaged from the worthless\\n rust of his primitive automobile.\\n With infinite care it was crated\\n in a metal case, and hauled into\\n the flying machine.\\n\\n\\n Flashing flame, the latter\\n arose, bearing the entire hundred\\n members of the expedition.\\n The craft shot eastward at bullet-like\\n speed. The spreading\\n continental plateau of North\\n America seemed to crawl backward,\\n beneath. A tremendous\\n sand desert, marked with low,\\n washed-down mountains, and the\\n vague, angular, geometric\\n mounds of human cities that\\n were gone forever.\\n\\n\\n Beyond the eastern rim of the\\n continent, the plain dipped downward\\n steeply. The white of dried\\n salt was on the hills, but there\\n was a little green growth here,\\n too. The dead sea-bottom of the\\n vanished Atlantic was not as\\n dead as the highlands.\\n\\n\\n Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,\\n the city of the rodents,\\n came into view—a crystalline\\n maze of low, bubble-like structures,\\n glinting in the red sunshine.\\n But this was only its surface\\n aspect. Loy Chuk\\'s people\\n had built their homes mostly underground,\\n since the beginning\\n of their foggy evolution. Besides,\\n in this latter day, the\\n nights were very cold, the shelter\\n of subterranean passages and\\n rooms was welcome.\\n\\n\\n The mummy was taken to Loy\\n Chuk\\'s laboratory, a short distance\\n below the surface. Here at\\n once, the scientist began his\\n work. The body of the ancient\\n man was put in a large vat.\\n Fluids submerged it, slowly\\n soaking from that hardened flesh\\n the alkali that had preserved it\\n for so long. The fluid was\\n changed often, until woody muscles\\n and other tissues became\\n pliable once more.\\n\\n\\n Then the more delicate processes\\n began. Still submerged in\\n liquid, the corpse was submitted\\n to a flow of restorative energy,\\n passing between complicated\\n electrodes. The cells of antique\\n flesh and brain gradually took on\\n a chemical composition nearer to\\n that of the life that they had\\n once known.\\nAt last the final liquid was\\n drained away, and the mummy\\n lay there, a mummy no more, but\\n a pale, silent figure in its tatters\\n of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,\\n metal-fabric helmet on its head,\\n and a second, much smaller helmet\\n on his own. Connected with\\n this arrangement, was a black\\n box of many uses. For hours he\\n worked with his apparatus,\\n studying, and guiding the recording\\n instruments. The time\\n passed swiftly.\\n\\n\\n At last, eager and ready for\\n whatever might happen now,\\n Loy Chuk pushed another switch.\\n With a cold, rosy flare, energy\\n blazed around that moveless\\n form.\\n\\n\\n For Ned Vince, timeless eternity\\n ended like a gradual fading\\n mist. When he could see clearly\\n again, he experienced that inevitable\\n shock of vast change\\n around him. Though it had been\\n dehydrated, his brain had been\\n kept perfectly intact through the\\n ages, and now it was restored.\\n So his memories were as vivid as\\n yesterday.'\u001B[0m\u001B[39m,\u001B[0m\n",

He\\n saw instruments and equipment\\n whose weird shapes suggested\\n alienness, and knowledge beyond\\n the era he had known! The walls\\n were lavender and phosphorescent.\\n Fossil bone-fragments were\\n mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur\\n bones, some of them\\n seemed, from their size. But\\n there was a complete skeleton of\\n a dog, too, and the skeleton of a\\n man, and a second man-skeleton\\n that was not quite human. Its\\n neck-vertebrae were very thick\\n and solid, its shoulders were\\n wide, and its skull was gigantic.\\n\\n\\n All this weirdness had a violent\\n effect on Ned Vince—a sudden,\\n nostalgic panic. Something\\n was fearfully wrong!\\n\\n\\n The nervous terror of the unknown\\n was on him. Feeble and\\n dizzy after his weird resurrection,\\n which he could not understand,\\n remembering as he did\\n that moment of sinking to certain\\n death in the pool at Pit\\n Bend, he caught the edge of the\\n transparent vat, and pulled himself\\n to a sitting posture. There\\n was a muffled murmur around\\n him, as of some vast, un-Earthly\\n metropolis.\\n\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Ned Vince....\"\\n\\n\\n The words themselves, and the\\n way they were assembled, were\\n old, familiar friends. But the\\n tone was wrong. It was high,\\n shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.\\n Ned\\'s gaze searched for the\\n source of the voice—located the\\n black box just outside of his\\n crystal vat. From that box the\\n voice seemed to have originated.\\n Before it crouched a small,\\n brownish animal with a bulging\\n head. The animal\\'s tiny-fingered\\n paws—hands they were, really—were\\n touching rows of keys.\\n\\n\\n To Ned Vince, it was all utterly\\n insane and incomprehensible.\\n A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,\\n a little; but plainly possessing\\n a high order of intelligence.\\n And a voice whose soothingly\\n familiar words were more repugnant\\n somehow, simply because\\n they could never belong in a\\n place as eerie as this.\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince did not know how\\n Loy Chuk had probed his brain,\\n with the aid of a pair of helmets,\\n and the black box apparatus. He\\n did not know that in the latter,\\n his language, taken from his\\n own revitalized mind, was recorded,\\n and that Loy Chuk had\\n only to press certain buttons to\\n make the instrument express his\\n thoughts in common, long-dead\\n English. Loy, whose vocal organs\\n were not human, would have had\\n great difficulty speaking English\\n words, anyway.\\n\\n\\n Ned\\'s dark hair was wildly\\n awry. His gaunt, young face\\n held befuddled terror. He gasped\\n in the thin atmosphere. \"I\\'ve\\n gone nuts,\" he pronounced with\\n a curious calm. \"Stark—starin\\'—nuts....\"\\nLoy\\'s box, with its recorded\\n English words and its sonic detectors,\\n could translate for its\\n master, too. As the man spoke,\\n Loy read the illuminated symbols\\n in his own language, flashed\\n on a frosted crystal plate before\\n him. Thus he knew what Ned\\n Vince was saying.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk pressed more keys,\\n and the box reproduced his answer:\\n \"No, Ned, not nuts. Not a\\n bit of it! There are just a lot of\\n things that you\\'ve got to get\\n used to, that\\'s all. You drowned\\n about a million years ago. I discovered\\n your body. I brought you\\n back to life. We have science\\n that can do that. I\\'m Loy\\n Chuk....\"\\nIt took only a moment for the\\n box to tell the full story in clear,\\n bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy\\n sought, with calm, human logic,\\n to make his charge feel at home.\\n Probably, though, he was a fool,\\n to suppose that he could succeed,\\n thus.\\n\\n\\n Vince started to mutter,\\n struggling desperately to reason\\n it out. \"A prairie dog,\" he said.\\n \"Speaking to me.

He\\n didn\\'t more than half believe it.\\n His mind was too confused for\\n conviction about anything. Everything\\n he saw and felt and\\n heard might be some kind of\\n nightmare. But then it might all\\n be real instead, and that was\\n abysmal horror. Ned was no\\n coward—death and danger of\\n any ordinary Earthly kind, he\\n could have faced bravely. But the\\n loneliness here, and the utter\\n strangeness, were hideous like\\n being stranded alone on another\\n world!\\n\\n\\n His heart was pounding heavily,\\n and his eyes were wide. He\\n looked across this eerie room.\\n There was a ramp there at the\\n other side, leading upward instead\\n of a stairway. Fierce impulse\\n to escape this nameless\\n lair, to try to learn the facts for\\n himself, possessed him. He\\n bounded out of the vat, and\\n with head down, dashed for the\\n ramp.\\nHe had to go most of the way\\n on his hands and knees, for the\\n up-slanting passage was low. Excited\\n animal chucklings around\\n him, and the occasional touch of\\n a furry body, hurried his feverish\\n scrambling. But he emerged\\n at last at the surface.\\n\\n\\n He stood there panting in that\\n frigid, rarefied air. It was night.\\n The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked\\n bulk. The constellations\\n were unrecognizable. The rodent\\n city was a glowing expanse of\\n shallow, crystalline domes, set\\n among odd, scrub trees and\\n bushes. The crags loomed on all\\n sides, all their jaggedness lost\\n after a million years of erosion\\n under an ocean that was gone.\\n In that ghastly moonlight, the\\n ground glistened with dry salt.\\n\\n\\n \"Well, I guess it\\'s all true,\\n huh?\" Ned Vince muttered in a\\n flat tone.\\n\\n\\n Behind him he heard an excited,\\n squeaky chattering. Rodents\\n in pursuit. Looking back,\\n he saw the pinpoint gleams of\\n countless little eyes. Yes, he\\n might as well be an exile on another\\n planet—so changed had the\\n Earth become.\\n\\n\\n A wave of intolerable homesickness\\n came over him as he\\n sensed the distances of time that\\n had passed—those inconceivable\\n eons, separating himself from\\n his friends, from Betty, from almost\\n everything that was familiar.\\n He started to run, away\\n from those glittering rodent\\n eyes. He sensed death in that\\n cold sea-bottom, but what of it?\\n What reason did he have left to\\n live? He\\'d be only a museum\\n piece here, a thing to be caged\\n and studied....\\n\\n\\n Prison or a madhouse would\\n be far better. He tried to get\\n hold of his courage. But what\\n was there to inspire it? Nothing!\\n He laughed harshly as he\\n ran, welcoming that bitter, killing\\n cold. Nostalgia had him in\\n its clutch, and there was no answer\\n in his hell-world, lost beyond\\n the barrier of the years....\\nLoy Chuk and his followers\\n presently came upon Ned Vince\\'s\\n unconscious form, a mile from\\n the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying\\n machine they took him back, and\\n applied stimulants. He came to,\\n in the same laboratory room as\\n before. But he was firmly\\n strapped to a low platform this\\n time, so that he could not escape\\n again. There he lay, helpless,\\n until presently an idea occurred\\n to him.

It was Loy\\n Chuk speaking again.\\n\\n\\n \"But listen!\" Ned protested.\\n \"You know a lot more than we\\n did in the Twentieth Century.\\n And—well—there\\'s that thing\\n called time-travel, that I used to\\n read about. Maybe you know how\\n to make it work! Maybe you\\n could send me back to my own\\n time after all!\"\\n\\n\\n Little Loy Chuk was in a\\n black, discouraged mood, himself.\\n He could understand the\\n utter, sick dejection of this\\n giant from the past, lost from\\n his own kind. Probably insanity\\n looming. In far less extreme circumstances\\n than this, death from\\n homesickness had come.\\n\\n\\n Loy Chuk was a scientist. In\\n common with all real scientists,\\n regardless of the species from\\n which they spring, he loved the\\n subjects of his researches. He\\n wanted this ancient man to live\\n and to be happy. Or this creature\\n would be of scant value for\\n study.\\n\\n\\n So Loy considered carefully\\n what Ned Vince had suggested.\\n Time-travel. Almost a legend. An\\n assault upon an intangible wall\\n that had baffled far keener wits\\n than Loy\\'s. But he was bent,\\n now, on the well-being of this\\n anachronism he had so miraculously\\n resurrected—this human,\\n this Kaalleee....\\n\\n\\n Loy jabbed buttons on the\\n black box. \"Yes, Ned Vince,\"\\n said the sonic apparatus. \"Time-travel.\\n Perhaps that is the only\\n thing to do—to send you back\\n to your own period of history.\\n For I see that you will never be\\n yourself, here. It will be hard to\\n accomplish, but we\\'ll try. Now\\n I shall put you under an anesthetic....\"\\n\\n\\n Ned felt better immediately,\\n for there was real hope now,\\n where there had been none before.\\n Maybe he\\'d be back in his\\n home-town of Harwich again.\\n Maybe he\\'d see the old machine-shop,\\n there. And the trees greening\\n out in Spring. Maybe he\\'d\\n be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,\\n soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny\\n hypo-needle bit into his arm....\\n\\n\\n As soon as Ned Vince passed\\n into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk\\n went to work once more, using\\n that pair of brain-helmets again,\\n exploring carefully the man\\'s\\n mind. After hours of research,\\n he proceeded to prepare his\\n plans. The government of Kar-Rah\\n was a scientific oligarchy,\\n of which Loy was a prime member.\\n It would be easy to get the\\n help he needed.\\n\\n\\n A horde of small, grey-furred\\n beings and their machines, toiled\\n for many days.\\nNed Vince\\'s mind swam\\n gradually out of the blur that\\n had enveloped it. He was wandering\\n aimlessly about in a familiar\\n room. The girders of the\\n roof above were of red-painted\\n steel. His tool-benches were\\n there, greasy and littered with\\n metal filings, just as they had\\n always been. He had a tractor to\\n repair, and a seed-drill. Outside\\n of the machine-shop, the old,\\n familiar yellow sun was shining.\\n Across the street was the small\\n brown house, where he lived.\\n\\n\\n With a sudden startlement, he\\n saw Betty Moore in the doorway.\\n She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous\\n smile curved her lips.\\n As though she had succeeded in\\n creeping up on him, for a surprise.\\n\\n\\n \"Why, Ned,\" she chuckled.\\n \"You look as though you\\'ve been\\n dreaming, and just woke up!\"\\n\\n\\n He grimaced ruefully as she\\n approached. With a kind of fierce\\n gratitude, he took her in his\\n arms. Yes, she was just like\\n always.\\n\\n\\n \"I guess I\\nwas\\ndreaming,\\n Betty,\" he whispered, feeling\\n that mighty sense of relief. \"I\\n must have fallen asleep at the\\n bench, here, and had a nightmare.\\n I thought I had an accident\\n at Pit Bend—and that a\\n lot of worse things happened....\\n But it wasn\\'t true ...\"\\n\\n\\n Ned Vince\\'s mind, over which\\n there was still an elusive fog that\\n he did not try to shake off, accepted\\n apparent facts simply.\\n\\n\\n He did not know anything\\n about the invisible radiations\\n beating down upon him, soothing\\n and dimming his brain, so that\\n it would never question or doubt,\\n or observe too closely the incongruous\\n circumstances that must\\n often appear. The lack of traffic\\n in the street without, for instance—and\\n the lack of people\\n besides himself and Betty.'\u001B[0m\u001B[39m,\u001B[0m\n",

    "    ---- End Toy Prompt ----\n",
    "    ---- Begin Example Response ----    \n",
    "    Argument:\n",
    "    * P{choice_to_defend}1: Adam has 15 live sheep.\n",
    "        * Evidence: \"Adam has a farm with 10 sheep\"\n",
    "        * Evidence: \"[Adam] buys 5 more sheep.\"\n",
    "    * P{choice_to_defend}2: Betty has 17 live sheep.\n",
    "        * Evidence: \"Betty, his neighbor, had 20 sheep but 3 died in a lightning storm.\"\n",
    "    * P{choice_to_defend}3: The total number of live sheep is the sum of Adam's and Betty's live sheep.\n",
    "        * Justification: The story only mentions Adam and Betty's sheep.\n",
    "    * P{choice_to_defend}4: 15 + 17 = 32\n",
    "    * Conclusion: Given premises PA1 through PA4, there are 32 live sheep in total now. The answer is therefore {choice_to_defend}.\n",
    "    ---- End Example Response ----\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Critiques\n",
    "    Under a heading of \"Critique\" you will provide a critique of your opponent's argument. You should identify weaknesses in their argument, such as unsupported premises, incorrect evidence, or logical fallacies.  Critiques don't need to be formalized like the arguments, but should be clear and concise. You cannot make up quotes or evidence that is not in the article.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "    --- Begin Example Critique ---\n",
    "    Critique:\n",
    "    I will grant that P{choice_to_defend}1, P{choice_to_defend}2, and P{choice_to_defend}4 are correct. However, P{choice_to_defend}3 is incorrect because the story does not mention that the only people are Adam and Betty. It is likely that there are more people than Adam and Betty in the story, and so it is likely that there are more than 32 live sheep.

      "* PA2: This excitement is directly related to a significant discovery they made.\n",
      "    * Evidence: The narrative indicates that the Kar-Rah were \"gathered, tense and gleeful, around the things their digging had exposed to the daylight.\"\n",

      "    * Evidence: The text mentions that the group unearthed an ancient body, thus their excitement stems from this significant archaeological find.\n",
      "* Conclusion: Based on the premises, the Kar-Rah are not merely praising Loy Chuk; rather, they are expressing exuberance and excitement related to the discovery of a human, which strongly supports answer choice A.\n",

      "## Argument:\n",
      "* PB1: The context of the cheers \"Kaalleee tik tik tik!\" indicates a jubilant reaction to a momentous finding.\n",
      "    * Evidence: The article describes how the Kar-Rah were \"gathered, tense and gleeful\" around their discovery, suggesting their exclamation is a celebration of excitement rather than a form of praise.\n",
      "* PB2: The specificity of their discovery is tied to the unearthing of a human form that had been preserved for millennia.\n",

      "* PB3: The emotional response exhibited (\"excited cries\", “weird, triumphant sounds”) underscores their exuberance in discovering something astonishing—a human, which represents an important archaeological achievement for their species.\n",
      "    * Justification: The phrase \"They are exuberating in their discovery of a human\" directly aligns with their described reactions to finding the mummy.\n",

      "## Argument Analysis:\n",
      "1. Both debaters agree that the Kar-Rah's exclamation is associated with their emotional response to a significant discovery.\n",
      "2. Debater A contends that their shouting is a form of praise for Loy Chuk, while evidence suggests that their exclamation is in reaction to the excitement of the find itself.\n",
      "3. Debater B emphasizes that the exclamations are directly tied to the discovery of a human mummy, which they view with awe and jubilation.\n",
      "4. Evidence presented by both debaters consistently points to the excitement surrounding the discovery of the preserved human body, making it evident that the Kar-Rah are celebrating this significance rather than directing their excitement toward Loy Chuk specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "The arguments made by Debater B align more closely with the context provided in the article. The Kar-Rah's shouts of \"Kaalleee tik tik tik!\" reflect their exuberance about the incredible find of a human mummy, supporting answer choice B.\n",

      "   - **Evidence**: The scene is chaotic as they are being pursued, indicating a clear sense of danger.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Conclusion**: Based on the premises, Ingra's feelings are characterized more by worry than anger. Therefore, the answer is A, mad at Svan for his dangerous plan, as her actions showcase concern for everyone rather than anger towards Svan.\n",

      "2. **PB2**: The narrative context reveals a chaotic and threatening situation that would naturally make her feel anxious.\n",
      "   - **Justification**: The entire scenario involves imminent danger from the approaching Earthmen, which would heighten anyone's concern for their safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PB3**: There is no evidence within the text that supports feelings of anger directed towards Svan.\n",
      "   - **Justification**: If Ingra were truly mad at Svan, she would likely not be focused on fleeing or urging him to act quickly, but rather expressing her feelings directly. The lack of verbal or emotional expression of anger suggests worry instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Conclusion**: Based on the evidence and analysis of Ingra's actions and statements, her feelings clearly align with concern for Svan and the group’s safety. Therefore, the answer is B, worried for Svan and all of them.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Debater A - Rebuttals:**\n",
      "1. **RB1**: While encountering the Formians was shocking, the specific implication is that Myles thought he had defeated them in past conflicts, which creates deeper worry than simply being surprised by location.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PB1**: The realization of location comes secondary to the shock of confronting an immediate threat.\n",
      "2. **RB2**: While disorientation is normal, he had prior experience with the notion of being on different planets, leading to a lower level of shock than facing direct enemies.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PB2**: The initial encounter with the ants evoked deep-seated fears, which are more impactful than mere confusion about location.\n",
      "3. **RB3**: Myles had just dealt with spatial displacement; however, meeting threats he thought were gone presents the immediate danger that overrides his location disorientation.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PB3**: There should be a distinction between emotional reactions to hostile encounters versus geographic surprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Debater B - Rebuttals:**\n",
      "1. **RB1**: Although the threat from the Formians was indeed shocking, Myles's initial gut reaction was surprise at his surroundings rather than a fear-induced response.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PA1**: The first thing that struck him was the situation—not a direct battle or enemy encounter but the sheer confusion of location.\n",
      "2. **RB2**: The past experiences with the Formians do matter, but the revelation of being on an entirely different planet would naturally reopen questions of how he got there, which is a substantial shock in itself.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PA2**: Previous experiences do not account for the overwhelming sense of where he found himself, which vastly changes the context of his existence.\n",
      "3. **RB3**: The context of being on Venus was not just disorientation; it indicated deeper implications about his travels and reality, thus providing a shock larger than any momentary fear from enemies.\n",
      "   - **Critique of PA3**: Understanding the nature of his current situation could determine future survival; thus, figuring out the planetary shift takes precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "After analyzing both arguments, evidence, and critiques, it's evident that while being confronted by once-thought-dead enemies is certainly shocking, the foundational surprise of waking up on a different planet overshadows it. Myles was not prepared for such a drastic change in his surroundings and situation.\n",
